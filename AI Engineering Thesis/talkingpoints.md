**What is an AI-First approach?**  
An AI-First approach positions AI at the core of product design and engineering decisions. It treats data as a primary asset, embraces continuous learning, and relies on probabilistic models rather than purely deterministic code. This mindset aims to create systems that adapt over time, prioritize data strategy, and enhance user experiences through intelligent behavior.

Roger:
An AI-First approach places AI at the center of product design, prioritizing data strategy and continuous learning while leveraging probabilistic models over static logic. Crucially, AI-First engineers use AI not just to build solutions but also to rapidly gain domain expertise, allowing them to navigate diverse fields more effectively and deliver solutions aligned with real-world needs.

**What is your AI framework?**  
The AI framework highlighted in the thesis focuses on a few key layers:  
1. **Strategic Foundation** – Define AI opportunities, ethical boundaries, and risk tolerance.  
2. **Technical Infrastructure** – Establish robust data pipelines, model registries, and experimentation platforms.  
3. **Continuous Learning & Monitoring** – Automate retraining, monitor data drift, and iterate based on performance feedback.  
4. **Cross-Functional Collaboration** – Work closely with product, domain experts, and ethicists.  

This structure ensures that AI capabilities remain central, scalable, and ethically sound throughout the development lifecycle.

Roger:
An AI-First framework isn't just about layering AI on existing products—it’s about carving a clear path from strategic planning to rapid, scalable deployment. Here’s how I tackle it:

1. **Strategic Foundation**  
   - Identify critical problems to solve and evaluate the real value of each AI feature.  
   - Focus on delivering a minimal viable product (MVP) that’s immediately useful and ready to scale later, instead of building extraneous features.

2. **Technical Infrastructure & Rapid Deployment**  
   - Start projects with a framework like Next.js for quick iteration and Vercel for near-instant deployments.  
   - Ensure robust authentication before proceeding—overlooking auth early on often causes major setbacks.  
   - Maintain flexibility by moving to more scalable environments as user needs and load grow.

3. **Continuous Learning & Monitoring**  
   - Set up pipelines for retraining, data integrity checks, and drift monitoring from the start.  
   - Implement real-time logs, analytics, and performance dashboards to iterate intelligently.

4. **Cross-Functional Collaboration**  
   - Collaborate with product managers, domain experts, and ethicists to pick high-impact AI opportunities.  
   - Harness AI itself to accelerate research, domain knowledge acquisition, and solution ideation.

Overall, the goal is to integrate AI at the core of the product—solving very specific user issues—while ensuring the infrastructure (including auth and monitoring) is set up to handle rapid growth and collaboration.

**How does someone become an AI-First engineer?**  
1. **Core Engineering Skills** – Strengthen fundamentals (data structures, algorithms, system design).  
2. **ML Expertise** – Gain practical knowledge of model development, training, and evaluation.  
3. **Data-Centric Mindset** – Focus on data quality, feature engineering, and interpretability.  
4. **Experimental Approach** – Embrace an iterative workflow of testing hypotheses, measuring performance, and retraining.  
5. **Communication** – Learn to explain probabilistic results, ethical considerations, and user impact across teams.

**Product Sense: Feature Impact**  
When we introduced AI-driven personalization features (e.g., improved content recommendations or explainable suggestions), users benefited from more relevant and transparent results. This drove higher engagement and trust, as they understood why certain content was surfaced. We chose these features over simpler AI add-ons because they addressed explicit user pain points (e.g., discovering new content efficiently) and aligned with the product’s core value proposition, delivering immediate, user-centric improvements.

Roger:
Developing a **keen product sense** is crucial for AI engineers because you can either go overboard with AI or omit it where it could be valuable. The best AI solutions weave into the user experience smoothly, rather than being slapped on top or concealed under the hood.

1. **Find the Right Balance**  
   - **Not Enough AI**: Miss out on potential improvements like personalization, automation, or intelligent insights.  
   - **Too Much AI**: Lose transparency and remove valuable mechanisms for human oversight.

2. **Focus on Human Value**  
   - Move beyond basic “human in the loop”—aim to understand precisely **why** humans need to be in the loop.  
   - In agentic workflows, identify where human judgment or creativity matters most, then optimize AI around that core contribution rather than replacing it.

3. **Deliver a Compelling Experience**  
   - AI chat flows can be a good starting point, but the real challenge is building experiences that enhance user capabilities, not simply automate tasks.  
   - Agent-based systems should prioritize assisting humans in higher-value work, reflecting the product’s goals and user’s needs.

Overall, AI should augment what people do best. Product sense for AI hinges on understanding **when and how** to insert AI into the experience so that it drives meaningful outcomes without diminishing the human role.
