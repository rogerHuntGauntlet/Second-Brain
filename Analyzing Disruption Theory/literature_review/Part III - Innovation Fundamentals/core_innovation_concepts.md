## Market and Customer Focus

### Customer Needs
1. **Need Identification**
   Wright's analysis emphasizes:
   - Expressed needs
   - Latent needs
   - Job-to-be-done
   - Value proposition

2. **Market Segmentation**
   Schaefer identifies two key types:
   - Low-end disruption (overserved customers)
   - New market disruption (non-consumers)

### Value Creation
