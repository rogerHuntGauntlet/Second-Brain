# Goal Analysis in Problem-Oriented Methodology

## Executive Summary
This document details the Goal Analysis component of our methodology, which focuses on working backwards from solutions to understand underlying goals, both explicit and implicit. This approach helps reveal the true motivations behind different approaches and identifies opportunities for collaboration or leverage.

- Systems thinking approach

### 3. Theoretical Assumptions
- Goals shape solutions
- Power influences objectives
- Context matters
- Multiple valid perspectives
