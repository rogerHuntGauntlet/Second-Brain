# Conceptual Analysis Framework

## Overview
This document outlines the systematic approach for analyzing the key concepts and theoretical foundations of disruption theory.

## Analysis Components

### 1. Core Concept Identification
- Identify and isolate key theoretical terms
- Map relationships between concepts
- Trace conceptual evolution over time
- Document varying interpretations and uses

### 2. Logical Structure Analysis
- Examine premises and conclusions
- Identify implicit assumptions
- Evaluate logical consistency
- Map causal relationships
- Test for circular reasoning

### 3. Definitional Analysis
- Examine concept definitions
- Identify ambiguities and vagueness
- Analyze operational definitions
- Compare competing interpretations
- Track definition evolution

### 4. Theoretical Framework Assessment
- Evaluate theoretical coherence
- Identify boundary conditions
- Examine predictive claims
- Analyze explanatory power
- Test for internal consistency

### 5. Conceptual Dependencies
- Map hierarchical relationships
- Identify foundational assumptions
- Examine theoretical prerequisites
- Analyze conceptual interdependencies

## Methodology Steps

1. **Initial Concept Mapping**
   - Create comprehensive concept list
   - Document primary sources
   - Note key relationships
   - Identify core propositions

2. **Deep Structure Analysis**
   - Examine underlying assumptions
   - Identify implicit premises
   - Map logical connections
   - Document theoretical mechanisms

3. **Critical Examination**
   - Test logical consistency
   - Identify contradictions
   - Examine edge cases
   - Challenge assumptions

4. **Synthesis**
   - Integrate findings
   - Document relationships
   - Identify improvements
   - Propose refinements

## Expected Outputs

1. Concept Maps
   - Visual representations of relationships
   - Hierarchical structures
   - Dependency diagrams

2. Analytical Tables
   - Definition comparisons
   - Assumption listings
   - Contradiction identification

3. Critical Analyses
   - Logical evaluations
   - Consistency assessments
