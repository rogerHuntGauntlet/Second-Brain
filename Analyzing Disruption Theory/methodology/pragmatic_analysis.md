# Pragmatic Analysis Framework

## Overview
This document outlines our pragmatic, solution-oriented approach to analyzing disruption theory. Rather than seeking a single coherent narrative, we examine multiple viewpoints through the lens of their goals, solutions, and contexts.

## Core Principles

1. **Solution-First Analysis**
   - Begin with proposed solutions/responses
   - Identify implemented approaches
   - Examine practical outcomes
   - Document real-world applications

2. **Goal Excavation**
   - Work backwards from solutions to goals
   - Identify stated vs implicit objectives
   - Map competing interests
   - Understand success criteria

3. **Contextual Understanding**
   - Historical circumstances
   - Market conditions
   - Power dynamics
   - Resource constraints
   - Stakeholder interests

4. **Alignment Analysis**
   - Goal alignment/misalignment
   - Solution compatibility
   - Resource requirements
   - Implementation feasibility

## Analysis Matrix

### Goals vs Solutions Matrix
|               | Same Solution | Different Solution |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Same Goal     | Debate effectiveness | Critical examination |
| Different Goal| Seek collaboration | Look for leverage |

## Methodology Steps

1. **Solution Mapping**
   - Document proposed solution
   - Identify key components
   - Map implementation approach
   - Track outcomes and results

2. **Goal Analysis**
   - Identify stated goals
   - Uncover implicit objectives
   - Map stakeholder interests
   - Document success criteria

3. **Context Examination**
   - Historical background
   - Market conditions
   - Resource availability
   - Power structures
   - Stakeholder relationships

4. **Alignment Evaluation**
   - Compare goals
   - Assess solution compatibility
   - Identify collaboration opportunities
   - Map leverage points

## Strategic Responses

1. **Same Goal, Same Solution**
   - Engage in theoretical debate
   - Compare effectiveness metrics
   - Share implementation insights
   - Pool resources

2. **Same Goal, Different Solution**
   - Analyze effectiveness
   - Compare resource requirements
   - Evaluate scalability
   - Test assumptions

3. **Different Goal, Same Solution**
   - Identify common ground
   - Propose collaboration
   - Share resources
   - Align metrics

4. **Different Goal, Different Solution**
   - Map leverage points
   - Identify dependencies
   - Find synergies
   - Propose partnerships

## Expected Outputs

1. **Solution Maps**
   - Implementation approaches
   - Resource requirements
   - Success metrics
   - Outcome tracking

2. **Goal Analysis**
   - Objective hierarchies
   - Success criteria
   - Stakeholder interests
   - Value propositions

3. **Strategic Recommendations**
   - Collaboration opportunities
   - Leverage points
   - Resource sharing
   - Implementation improvements
