# Preserving Human Agency in Optimization Systems: A Framework for Override Mechanism Design

## Abstract

This paper addresses the critical challenge of maintaining meaningful human control in automated optimization systems. While existing approaches often treat human oversight as a simple binary choice between automation and manual control, we propose a sophisticated framework for designing override mechanisms that preserve human agency across different temporal and operational contexts. Through comparative analysis of override mechanisms in healthcare, financial trading, and industrial control systems, we develop specific protocols for maintaining meaningful human control while respecting operational efficiency requirements. Our framework provides concrete guidance for implementing graduated intervention mechanisms that adapt to varying time pressures while ensuring effective human oversight.
