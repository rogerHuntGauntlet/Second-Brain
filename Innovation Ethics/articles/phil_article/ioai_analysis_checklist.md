# IOAI Analysis Checklist

This document provides a systematic framework for analyzing the Innovation-Optimization Alignment Index (IOAI) through multiple theoretical perspectives.

## Analysis Framework

For each theoretical perspective, address the following dimensions:

### 1. Conceptual Analysis

- [ ] What key concepts/tools does this perspective bring to analyzing IOAI?
- [ ] What assumptions about innovation and optimization does this perspective reveal?
- [ ] How does this perspective understand the relationship between measurement and reality?

### 2. Power and Agency
- [ ] How does this perspective illuminate power relations embedded in IOAI?
- [ ] What forms of agency (human/organizational) does this perspective reveal or problematize?
- [ ] How does this perspective understand IOAI's role in shaping behavior and decision-making?
- [ ] What forms of resistance or alternative practices does this perspective suggest?

### 3. Methodological Insights
- [ ] What methodological tools does this perspective offer for studying IOAI?
- [ ] How might this perspective enhance IOAI's measurement approach?
- [ ] What limitations or blind spots in IOAI does this perspective reveal?
- [ ] What additional variables or considerations does this perspective suggest?

### 4. Practical Implications
- [ ] What practical recommendations for IOAI implementation follow from this perspective?
- [ ] How might this perspective inform platform design and governance?
- [ ] What stakeholder concerns does this perspective highlight?
- [ ] What potential unintended consequences does this perspective identify?

### 5. Synthesis and Integration
- [ ] How does this perspective complement or conflict with other theoretical views?
- [ ] What unique contributions does this perspective make to understanding IOAI?
- [ ] What future research directions does this perspective suggest?
- [ ] How might this perspective inform IOAI's evolution?

## Theoretical Perspectives

### 1. Technology as Mediation and Power

- Key concepts: Enframing, technological rationalization, surveillance logics
- Key questions:
  - [ ] How does IOAI mediate power relations in platform contexts?
  - [ ] How does IOAI embody specific forms of technological rationalization?
  - [ ] What surveillance logics are embedded in IOAI's measurement approach?

### 2. Cultural Transformation and Professional Identity
- Focus: Professional practice, cultural change, expertise
- Key concepts: Technical culture, habitus, algorithmic governmentality
- Key questions:
  - [ ] How does IOAI transform professional identity and practice?
