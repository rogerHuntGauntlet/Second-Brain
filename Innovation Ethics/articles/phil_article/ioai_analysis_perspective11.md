# Analysis of IOAI Through Cognitive Science

## 1. Conceptual Analysis

### How does this perspective reframe IOAI?
- IOAI as a cognitive scaffold that shapes professional thinking and decision-making
- The index as extending and transforming cognitive processes through metrics
- IOAI as creating new forms of distributed cognition in platform environments

### Key Concepts/Tools Applied to IOAI
- Clark's extended mind theory reveals IOAI as cognitive extension
- Hutchins's distributed cognition shows IOAI's role in collective intelligence
- Hayles's cognitive assemblages illuminate human-algorithm interaction

### Assumptions Revealed
- The relationship between metrics and cognitive processes
- The nature of professional decision-making
- The role of external scaffolding in innovation

### Measurement-Reality Relationship
- IOAI as cognitive prosthesis
- Metrics as tools for thought
- The index as structuring mental models
