# Analysis of IOAI Through Environmental Philosophy

## 1. Conceptual Analysis

### How does this perspective reframe IOAI?
- IOAI as embedded in material-ecological systems
- The index as potentially obscuring environmental impacts
- IOAI as mediating human-environment relationships in innovation

### Key Concepts/Tools Applied to IOAI
