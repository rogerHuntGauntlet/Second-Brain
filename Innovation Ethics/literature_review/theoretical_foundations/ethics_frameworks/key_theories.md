# Ethics Frameworks in Technology and Innovation

## Foundational Frameworks

### 1. Value Sensitive Design (Friedman & Hendry, 2019)
- **Key Concept**: Incorporating human values in technology design
  * Conceptual investigation of values
  * Empirical investigation of value contexts
  * Technical investigation of design features
  
- **Core Principles**:
  * Proactive value consideration
  * Stakeholder inclusivity
  * Value trade-off analysis
  * Iterative design process

- **Relevance**: 
  * Framework for evaluating optimization impacts
  * Method for identifying value conflicts
  * Approach to stakeholder value integration
  * Guide for ethical design decisions

- **Application Areas**:
  1. Knowledge System Design
     * Value mapping in professional networks
     * Ethical considerations in automation
     * Stakeholder value preservation
  
  2. Implementation Strategy
     * Value-sensitive deployment plans
     * Impact assessment frameworks
     * Mitigation strategy development

- **Research Questions**:
  * How do optimization metrics affect human values?
  * Can we balance efficiency with value preservation?
  * What methods best identify value conflicts?
  * How can we measure value preservation?

### 2. Responsible Innovation (von Schomberg, 2013)
- **Key Dimensions**:
  1. Anticipatory
     * Future impact assessment
     * Risk identification
     * Opportunity mapping
  
  2. Reflexive
     * Assumptions examination
     * Value consideration
     * Bias recognition
  
  3. Inclusive
     * Stakeholder engagement
     * Diverse perspective integration
     * Participatory design
  
  4. Responsive
     * Adaptive management
     * Iterative development
     * Feedback integration

- **Implementation Framework**:
  * Governance structures
  * Stakeholder engagement processes
  * Impact assessment methods
  * Adaptation protocols

### 3. Care Ethics in Technology (Tronto, 2013)
- **Core Elements**:
  1. Attentiveness
     * Recognizing needs
     * Understanding impacts
     * Monitoring effects
  
  2. Responsibility
     * Duty of care
     * Professional obligations
     * Community support
  
  3. Competence
     * Capability development
     * Resource allocation
     * Support systems
  
  4. Responsiveness
     * Feedback mechanisms
     * Adaptation processes
     * Support structures

- **Application Framework**:
  * Community support systems
  * Professional development programs
  * Impact monitoring methods
  * Adaptation strategies
