    > - Maximizes predefined metrics
    > - Focuses on algorithmic efficiency
    > - Refines established processes

  - [x] Define "innovation" clearly and distinctly
    > Innovation: A mode of system change that involves the creation of new system boundaries, metrics, and possibilitiesâ€”fundamentally altering what is considered valuable or possible. Key characteristics:
    > - Creates new system boundaries
    > - Establishes new metrics
    > - Expands possibility spaces
    > - Transforms fundamental practices
