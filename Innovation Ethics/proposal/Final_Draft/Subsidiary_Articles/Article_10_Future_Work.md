# The Future of Work Under Optimization: Redefining Professional Agency in Algorithm-Driven Organizations

## Target Journal
Administrative Science Quarterly

## Abstract
This study examines how optimization systems are fundamentally reshaping the nature of professional work and worker agency across sectors. Through longitudinal analysis of work practices before and after optimization system implementation in manufacturing, healthcare, and professional services, we document systematic transformations in professional decision-making, skill development, and work autonomy. Our findings reveal significant shifts in professional agency (61% reduction in discretionary decision-making), changes in skill development trajectories (57% shift toward system management skills), and transformation of professional advancement paths. The study contributes to future of work theory by establishing how optimization systems fundamentally redefine professional roles and agency.
