# Optimization as Innovation? Platform Economics and the Rhetoric of Technological Change

## Target Journal
MIS Quarterly

## Abstract
This study examines how platform companies mischaracterize optimization algorithms as business model innovations, creating significant tensions between operational reality and stakeholder expectations. Through comparative analysis of ride-sharing, content delivery, and e-commerce platforms, we document how algorithmic systems primarily optimize traditional metrics (31% wait time reduction, 28% engagement increase) while being marketed as transformative innovations. Our findings reveal how this misalignment affects platform workers' autonomy (38-74% reduction in decision-making) and shapes platform evolution. The study contributes to platform economics theory by establishing the optimization-innovation distinction as crucial for understanding platform dynamics and stakeholder outcomes.

## Key Contributions
1. Empirical analysis of optimization-innovation misalignment in platform economics
2. Framework for evaluating algorithmic systems in platform contexts
3. Theory development linking platform rhetoric to worker experiences
4. Guidelines for authentic platform innovation communication

## Research Questions
1. How do platforms frame optimization algorithms as business model innovations?
2. What impacts does this mischaracterization have on platform workers and users?
3. How does algorithmic optimization shape platform evolution?
