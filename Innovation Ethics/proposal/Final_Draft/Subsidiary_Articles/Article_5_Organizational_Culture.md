# The Cultural Cost of Optimization: How Innovation Rhetoric Shapes Organizational Learning

## Target Journal
Administrative Science Quarterly

## Abstract
This study examines how the misalignment between optimization practices and innovation rhetoric affects organizational culture and learning capabilities. Through longitudinal analysis of four organizations across manufacturing and professional services sectors, we document systematic declines in employee-initiated improvements (57% reduction), psychological safety for suggesting changes (47% decrease), and bottom-up innovation potential when optimization systems are mischaracterized as innovations. Our findings reveal a self-reinforcing cycle where this misalignment progressively narrows organizational possibility spaces, fundamentally altering how organizations learn and adapt. The study contributes to organizational learning theory by establishing optimization-innovation misalignment as a crucial mechanism in cultural transformation.

## Key Contributions
1. Empirical documentation of cultural impacts from optimization-innovation misalignment
2. Theory development linking rhetorical misalignment to organizational learning
3. Framework for understanding cultural evolution under optimization systems
4. Guidelines for maintaining innovative culture during optimization initiatives

## Research Questions
1. How does optimization-innovation misalignment affect organizational learning capabilities?
2. What mechanisms drive the decline in employee-initiated improvements?
3. How do organizations maintain innovation potential under optimization pressures?
