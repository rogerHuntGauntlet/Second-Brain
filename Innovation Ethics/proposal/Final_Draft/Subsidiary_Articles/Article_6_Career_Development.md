# Optimizing Away Expertise: Career Development Under Algorithmic Management

## Target Journal
Journal of Applied Psychology

## Abstract
This study examines how optimization initiatives transform professional career development trajectories across manufacturing, healthcare, and professional services sectors. Through longitudinal analysis of career progression patterns before and after optimization system implementation, we document systematic shifts from expertise-based advancement to optimization management roles. Our findings reveal significant reductions in creative problem-solving opportunities (67%), independent decision-making development (58%), and innovation skill building (64%) across sectors. The study contributes to career development theory by establishing how optimization systems fundamentally reshape professional growth pathways and skill development opportunities.

## Key Contributions
1. Empirical documentation of career pathway transformation under optimization systems
2. Cross-sector analysis of skill development constraints
3. Framework for understanding expertise evolution under algorithmic management
4. Guidelines for maintaining professional development under optimization regimes

## Research Questions
1. How do optimization systems reshape professional career development paths?
2. What skills become more/less valuable under optimization regimes?
3. How do professionals adapt their career strategies to optimization constraints?
