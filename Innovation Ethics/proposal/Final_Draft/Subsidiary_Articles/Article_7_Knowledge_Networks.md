# Optimizing Away Knowledge Networks: How Algorithmic Systems Transform Professional Communities

## Target Journal
Organization Science

## Abstract
This study examines how optimization systems transform professional knowledge networks and expertise sharing patterns across organizations. Through social network analysis of six professional communities before and after optimization system implementation, we document systematic changes in knowledge flow patterns, consultation relationships, and expertise development. Our findings reveal significant disruptions to informal knowledge networks (42% reduction in weak ties), changes in expertise validation patterns (65% shift toward algorithmic validation), and transformation of learning processes. The study contributes to knowledge network theory by establishing how optimization systems fundamentally reshape professional community structures and learning dynamics.

## Key Contributions
