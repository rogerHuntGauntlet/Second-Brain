# Trust Under Optimization: Stakeholder Relationships in Algorithm-Driven Organizations

## Target Journal
Academy of Management Journal

## Abstract
This study investigates how optimization systems affect trust dynamics between stakeholders in organizational settings. Through comparative analysis of trust relationships before and after optimization system implementation across manufacturing and healthcare sectors, we document systematic changes in trust formation, maintenance, and repair processes. Our findings reveal significant shifts in trust anchors (73% shift from interpersonal to system trust), changes in trust repair mechanisms (58% reduction in effectiveness of traditional repair strategies), and transformation of trust development patterns. The study contributes to trust theory by establishing how optimization systems fundamentally reshape stakeholder relationship dynamics.

## Key Contributions
1. Empirical documentation of trust transformation under optimization
2. Theory development linking algorithmic systems to trust dynamics
3. Framework for understanding trust evolution in optimized environments
4. Guidelines for maintaining stakeholder trust during optimization
