3. **Rule-Following Process Flow**

## Key Takeaways

1. Later Wittgenstein's work provides a rich framework for understanding transactions
2. Language games can be reinterpreted as sophisticated transaction protocols
3. Forms of life represent the ecosystems within which transactions occur
4. Rule-following ensures the stability and effectiveness of transaction systems

## Bridge to Contemporary Applications

The transactional framework developed in Wittgenstein's later work provides powerful tools for understanding modern phenomena, from digital platforms to social networks, setting the stage for exploring contemporary applications in the next chapter.
