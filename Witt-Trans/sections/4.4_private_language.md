# IV. Private Language Argument Revisited

## A. Transaction Perspective

### 1. Private vs. Public

a) **Individual Experience**
- Personal sensations
- Internal states
- Subjective feelings
- Private thoughts
- Mental imagery
- Unique perceptions

b) **Shared Understanding**

- Social validation
- Community standards
- Cultural frameworks

c) **Common Ground**
- Mutual knowledge
- Shared context
- Joint experience
- Collective memory
- Social practices
- Cultural heritage

d) **Collective Validation**

- Social confirmation
- Group authentication
- Public recognition
- Shared assessment
- Cultural acceptance

### 2. Verification Problem

- Validation methods
- Confirmation processes
- Testing procedures
- Evidence requirements
- Proof standards

b) **Meaning Validation**
- Semantic verification
- Usage confirmation
- Context alignment
- Purpose validation
- Function verification
- Application testing

c) **Understanding Confirmation**
- Comprehension checks
- Interpretation validation
- Meaning verification
- Usage confirmation
- Application testing
- Practice evaluation

d) **Success Criteria**
- Transaction completion
- Goal achievement
- Purpose fulfillment
- Value creation
- Outcome validation
- Impact assessment

### 3. Social Nature of Meaning

a) **Community Standards**
- Collective norms

- Verification obstacles
- Testing limitations
- Proof constraints

### 2. Public Transaction Requirements

a) **Shared Context**
- Common environment
- Joint setting
- Collective situation
- Mutual background
- Group context
- Social framework

b) **Communication Channels**
