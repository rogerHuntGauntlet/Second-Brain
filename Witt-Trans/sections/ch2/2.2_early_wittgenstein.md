## Visual Elements

1. **Tractatus Structure Diagram**
   [Visual representation of the book's logical architecture]

2. **Picture Theory Transaction Map**
   [Illustration of proto-transactional elements in picture theory]

3. **Limitation-Development Matrix**
   [Analysis of limitations and potential developments]

## Key Takeaways

1. The Tractatus contains important proto-transactional elements
2. Picture theory can be viewed as an early exchange model
3. Limitations point toward later developments
4. Foundation established for fuller transaction theory

## Bridge to Transition Period

The limitations and tensions in the early work naturally led to developments in the transition period, where Wittgenstein began to recognize the need for a more dynamic, context-sensitive approach to language and meaning.
