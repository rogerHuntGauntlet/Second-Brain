## Key Takeaways

1. The transition period marked a crucial shift from static to dynamic understanding
2. Teaching and practical experience played key roles in changing Wittgenstein's views
3. Early transactional elements emerged through focus on practice and social context
4. The foundations for later work were established during this period

## Bridge to Later Work

The transition period's developments naturally led to the fuller transactional framework of the Philosophical Investigations, where language games and forms of life became central concepts.
