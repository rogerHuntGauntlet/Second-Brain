# Chapter 2: A Brief Introduction to Wittgenstein's Life and Thought

Wittgenstein's intellectual journey offers a fascinating window into the evolution of language and thought. In this chapter, we embark on an exploration of how his early, logically rigorous approach transformed into a dynamic, socially embedded framework of understanding. 

Emerging from the austere clarity of the *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*, his early work sought to map propositions directly onto the fabric of reality. Yet, as his experiences broadened—through teaching, mathematical inquiry, and exposure to the vibrant intellectual milieus of Vienna and Cambridge—Wittgenstein began to discern that language transcends static representation. Instead, it is a living practice, one whose meaning is forged in the transactions of everyday life.

This chapter is structured in three distinct yet interrelated phases. We begin with an examination of his picture-theoretic phase, where language is treated as a transparent mirror of reality. Next, we navigate the transition period—a time marked by growing doubts, emerging influences, and a gradual shift toward viewing language as a social practice. Finally, we delve into his later period where these ideas mature into a comprehensive transactional framework, emphasizing language games, rule-following, and the social underpinnings of communication.

Together, these sections not only chart the development of Wittgenstein’s thought but also set the stage for understanding his enduring impact on contemporary discussions around digital communication and global cultural exchanges. This introduction serves as both a gateway into his evolving philosophy and a bridge to the deeper analyses that follow in subsequent chapters.
