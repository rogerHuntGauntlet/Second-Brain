2. **Context Matrix**

3. **System Limit Map**
   [Framework showing system-level boundaries and their interactions]

## Key Takeaways

1. Meaningful exchange is bounded by multiple layers of constraints, from cognitive to systemic
2. Contextual limitations play a crucial role in shaping transaction possibilities
3. System-level boundaries emerge from the interaction of multiple constraint types
4. Understanding these boundaries is essential for effective communication design

## Bridge to Next Section

The exploration of these boundaries naturally leads to a reexamination of Wittgenstein's private language argument from a transactional perspective, which we will explore in the next section.
