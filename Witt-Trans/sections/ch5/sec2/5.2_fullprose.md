# II. Rule-Following as Transaction Management

Wittgenstein's analysis of rule-following, particularly in the *Philosophical Investigations*, provides a foundation for understanding how rules function in transactional systems. By extending his insights beyond language to all forms of transaction, we can develop a richer understanding of how rules enable, constrain, and shape meaningful exchanges. This section examines the nature of rules in transactions, their implementation, and their evolution over time.

Wittgenstein's exploration of rule-following challenges the notion that rules operate as rigid, deterministic structures that mechanically guide behavior. Instead, he reveals that rule-following is an inherently social practice embedded within what he terms "forms of life." When we apply this perspective to transaction management, we see that rules do not simply dictate exchanges but rather constitute the very possibility of meaningful transaction. The paradox Wittgenstein identifies—that no rule can determine its own application—becomes particularly relevant in complex transactional systems where participants must navigate ambiguity while maintaining coherent exchanges.

Transaction management, viewed through this Wittgensteinian lens, becomes less about enforcing compliance with predetermined protocols and more about cultivating shared practices that enable meaningful exchange. This shift in perspective has profound implications for how we design, implement, and evolve rule systems across various domains, from economic markets to social institutions, from technological platforms to cultural practices. By recognizing the practice-based nature of rule-following, we can develop more effective approaches to transaction management that acknowledge both the enabling and constraining functions of rules.

## A. The Nature of Rules in Transactions

Rules in transactional systems serve multiple functions and exist in various forms. Understanding their nature is crucial for developing effective transaction management strategies. The multifaceted character of rules reflects the complex interplay between explicit codification and implicit understanding that characterizes all meaningful human exchanges.

At their core, transactional rules establish the conditions of possibility for exchange by defining what counts as a valid transaction within a particular system. They create the shared understanding necessary for participants to coordinate their actions and interpret each other's behavior. However, these rules are not simply external constraints imposed upon transactions; rather, they constitute the very fabric of transactional meaning. Without rules, there would be no transactions—only random, meaningless interactions lacking coherence or purpose.

### 1. Types of Rules

Transactional systems incorporate diverse types of rules that operate at different levels of explicitness and formality. These various rule types do not function in isolation but rather form an interconnected ecology that shapes transactional practices. Understanding this ecology requires attention to both the distinct characteristics of each rule type and the ways they interact to create coherent transactional environments.

a) **Explicit Protocols**

Explicit protocols represent the most visible and formally articulated rules within transactional systems. These protocols take the form of documented guidelines, policies, and specifications that provide clear direction for transaction participants. Formal guidelines and procedures establish step-by-step processes for conducting transactions, ensuring consistency and predictability across multiple exchanges. Written policies and documented standards codify acceptable practices and establish boundaries for transactional behavior, creating reference points that participants can consult when uncertainty arises.

Contractual agreements and terms of service represent legally binding explicit protocols that define the rights, responsibilities, and expectations of transaction participants. These documents transform informal understandings into enforceable commitments, providing recourse when transactions fail to meet established standards. Similarly, technical specifications and interface requirements establish the parameters within which technological systems can interact, ensuring compatibility and functionality across diverse platforms and applications.

b) **Implicit Norms**

Beneath the surface of explicit protocols lies a rich substrate of implicit norms that profoundly shape transactional behavior. These unwritten social conventions operate largely outside conscious awareness yet exert powerful influence over how transactions unfold. Cultural expectations and practices embed transactions within broader patterns of social meaning, connecting individual exchanges to collective values and historical traditions. These implicit norms often determine what counts as appropriate, respectful, or fair within a given transactional context.

Professional standards and ethics represent a specialized form of implicit norms that govern behavior within particular occupational communities. These standards emerge through education, mentorship, and shared practice, creating a sense of professional identity that guides decision-making in ambiguous situations. The tacit understanding between participants—what Wittgenstein might call a "meeting of minds"—enables smooth coordination without requiring explicit articulation of every expectation. This tacit dimension allows transactions to proceed efficiently while maintaining sensitivity to contextual nuances.

c) **Emergent Patterns**

Emergent patterns arise organically from repeated interactions within transactional systems, crystallizing into recognizable structures that guide future behavior. These patterns represent a dynamic form of rule-making that evolves through practice rather than deliberate design. Recurring behaviors become standardized through repetition and mutual reinforcement, creating expectations that shape subsequent transactions. As participants recognize the effectiveness of certain approaches, these approaches gain normative force, influencing behavior even without formal codification.

Best practices developed through experience represent a particularly important form of emergent pattern. These practices embody collective wisdom about effective transaction management, distilled from numerous instances of trial and error. Adaptive responses to common situations similarly emerge as participants discover effective ways to handle recurring challenges, creating a repertoire of strategies that can be deployed when similar situations arise. Self-organizing system behaviors demonstrate how coherent patterns can emerge from distributed interactions without centralized control, illustrating Wittgenstein's insight that rule-following is ultimately grounded in shared practices rather than abstract principles.

d) **Cultural Conventions**

Cultural conventions embed transactions within broader systems of meaning that transcend individual exchanges. These conventions connect transactional practices to fundamental values, beliefs, and worldviews that characterize particular communities. Shared assumptions and values provide the background against which transactions acquire significance, determining what counts as valuable, appropriate, or meaningful within a given cultural context. Traditional practices and customs link contemporary transactions to historical precedents, creating continuity across generations and situating exchanges within narratives of collective identity.

Social rituals and ceremonies represent highly structured cultural conventions that imbue transactions with symbolic significance beyond their immediate practical functions. These ritualized exchanges—from formal business negotiations to gift-giving practices—follow prescribed patterns that communicate respect, establish relationships, and affirm shared values. Community standards and expectations similarly reflect collective judgments about appropriate transactional behavior, creating social pressure that shapes individual choices even in the absence of formal enforcement mechanisms.

### 2. Rule Functions

Rules perform essential functions within transactional systems, enabling meaningful exchange while protecting system integrity. These functions reveal how rules serve not merely as constraints but as generative structures that make complex transactions possible. By examining these functions, we gain insight into why rule systems develop particular characteristics and how they contribute to effective transaction management.

a) **Transaction Facilitation**

The primary function of rules in transactional systems is to facilitate meaningful exchange by creating the conditions necessary for successful interaction. Rules establish common ground between parties by providing shared reference points that enable mutual understanding. This common ground includes not only agreement about the subject of exchange but also shared expectations about how the transaction should proceed. Without this foundation of shared understanding, participants would struggle to coordinate their actions or interpret each other's behavior.

Rules define acceptable forms of exchange by establishing boundaries around what constitutes a valid transaction within a particular system. These boundaries clarify what can be exchanged, how exchanges should be conducted, and what obligations arise from participation. By creating predictable interaction patterns, rules reduce the cognitive burden on participants, allowing them to engage in transactions without constantly negotiating basic parameters. This predictability also reduces uncertainty and complexity, making transactions more efficient and less prone to misunderstanding or conflict.

b) **Value Preservation**

Beyond facilitating individual transactions, rules play a crucial role in preserving the value that makes transactions meaningful. Rules protect core transaction meanings by maintaining the integrity of key concepts and practices that define a particular transactional domain. This preservation function is especially important in systems where value depends on shared understanding and collective commitment, such as monetary systems, professional communities, or cultural traditions.

Rules maintain system integrity by preventing practices that would undermine the foundations of transactional meaning. By establishing standards and boundaries, they ensure that transactions remain connected to their intended purposes and values. This function includes ensuring consistent value exchange across multiple transactions, preventing inflation, devaluation, or corruption of transactional meaning. Rules also prevent degradation of standards that might occur through gradual drift or intentional exploitation, maintaining the quality and reliability that make transactions worthwhile.

c) **Error Prevention**

Transactional systems inevitably encounter errors, misunderstandings, and failures that threaten successful exchange. Rules serve a critical function in preventing these errors or minimizing their impact when they occur. By identifying potential mistakes before they happen, rules direct attention to areas of risk and encourage preventive measures. This anticipatory function helps participants avoid common pitfalls that might otherwise disrupt transactions.

Rules establish verification procedures that confirm essential elements of transactions, ensuring that exchanges meet necessary conditions before proceeding. These procedures range from simple checks to elaborate validation protocols, depending on the complexity and stakes of the transaction. Rules also create safety mechanisms that protect against catastrophic failures, limiting damage when errors do occur. By building in redundancy—multiple layers of protection or verification—rule systems create resilience against both anticipated and unanticipated problems.

d) **System Maintenance**

The long-term sustainability of transactional systems depends on rules that support ongoing maintenance and adaptation. Rules keep transactions aligned with goals by connecting individual exchanges to broader purposes and values, preventing drift away from intended functions. This alignment ensures that transactions continue to serve their designed purposes rather than becoming ends in themselves or being diverted to unintended uses.

Rules manage resource allocation within transactional systems, ensuring that necessary inputs are available and appropriately distributed. This function includes not only material resources but also attention, time, and social capital required for successful transactions. Rules maintain operational efficiency by streamlining processes and eliminating unnecessary steps or requirements that would create friction without adding value. By supporting system stability, rules create the predictable environment necessary for participants to make commitments and investments with confidence in future conditions.

### 3. Rule Evolution

Transactional systems exist in dynamic environments that require continuous adaptation and development. The evolution of rules represents a critical process through which systems maintain relevance and effectiveness in changing conditions. This evolutionary dimension reveals the inherently historical nature of rule systems, challenging static conceptions that treat rules as fixed or timeless structures.

a) **Adaptation Processes**

Rules evolve through adaptation processes that respond to changing conditions within and beyond transactional systems. These processes involve recognizing shifts in the environment, evaluating their implications, and modifying rules accordingly. Response to changing conditions may be reactive—addressing problems after they emerge—or proactive—anticipating changes and preparing for them in advance. Either approach requires sensitivity to contextual factors and willingness to reconsider established practices.

Learning from experience constitutes a fundamental adaptation process through which rules incorporate insights gained from actual transactions. This experiential learning includes both successes and failures, using both positive and negative examples to refine rule systems. Integration of new requirements represents another key adaptation process, as rules expand to accommodate emerging needs, technologies, or values. The modification of existing practices—adjusting, extending, or reinterpreting established rules—allows systems to evolve incrementally without disrupting core functions.

b) **Innovation Patterns**

While adaptation processes modify existing rules, innovation patterns generate fundamentally new approaches to transaction management. The creation of new rule sets represents a radical innovation that establishes entirely new frameworks for exchange, often in response to novel opportunities or challenges that existing rules cannot adequately address. These innovations may draw inspiration from existing systems but reconfigure elements in distinctive ways that enable new forms of transaction.

The development of novel protocols similarly creates new pathways for exchange by establishing innovative procedures, standards, or interfaces. These protocols may emerge through deliberate design or through experimental practices that crystallize into recognizable patterns. Experimentation with alternatives plays a crucial role in rule innovation, creating spaces where new approaches can be tested without immediately disrupting established systems. System redesign and improvement represent more comprehensive innovation patterns that reconfigure multiple elements simultaneously, creating integrated solutions to complex transactional challenges.

c) **Learning Mechanisms**

The evolution of rules depends on learning mechanisms that capture, process, and apply knowledge gained through transactional experience. Feedback incorporation represents a primary learning mechanism through which systems absorb information about outcomes, adjusting rules based on observed results. This feedback may come from formal evaluation processes or from informal observations about what works and what doesn't in practice.

Pattern recognition enables systems to identify recurring challenges, opportunities, or failure modes that require rule adaptation. This recognition may occur through deliberate analysis or through intuitive understanding developed through immersion in transactional practices. Knowledge accumulation builds repositories of insights, examples, and principles that inform rule development, creating institutional memory that transcends individual experiences. Best practice development distills this accumulated knowledge into recommended approaches that can be shared across contexts, accelerating learning and improving outcomes.

d) **Change Management**

The implementation of rule changes requires careful management to maintain system functionality while incorporating improvements. Controlled rule modification establishes processes for changing rules without disrupting essential operations, ensuring that adaptations enhance rather than undermine transactional effectiveness. These processes include mechanisms for proposing, evaluating, testing, and implementing changes with appropriate oversight and documentation.

Transition planning addresses the challenges of moving from one rule system to another, creating pathways that minimize disruption and maximize adoption. This planning includes consideration of timing, sequencing, and support needed to facilitate successful transitions. Impact assessment evaluates the potential effects of rule changes on various stakeholders and system functions, identifying risks and benefits before implementation. Implementation strategies develop specific approaches for introducing changes, including communication, training, incentives, and monitoring to ensure effective adoption and integration.

## B. Rule Implementation

The effective implementation of rules requires careful attention to establishment, enforcement, and adaptation processes. Implementation transforms abstract principles into concrete practices that shape actual transactions. This transformation involves not only technical considerations but also social, psychological, and institutional factors that influence how rules function in practice.

The implementation of rules represents a critical bridge between theoretical design and practical effectiveness. Even the most thoughtfully designed rules will fail to achieve their intended purposes if implementation is flawed or incomplete. Conversely, skillful implementation can sometimes compensate for imperfections in rule design, creating functional systems despite theoretical limitations. This relationship between design and implementation highlights the importance of considering practical realities throughout the rule development process.

### 1. Protocol Establishment

The establishment of protocols creates the foundation for rule-based transaction management. This process involves not only defining rules but also creating the conditions necessary for their effective operation. Protocol establishment requires attention to both technical specifications and social acceptance, recognizing that rules function effectively only when they are both well-designed and widely embraced.

a) **Standard Setting**

Standard setting defines the parameters within which transactions will operate, creating reference points that guide behavior and evaluation. Defining core requirements establishes the essential elements that transactions must include to be considered valid within the system. These requirements may address substantive content, procedural steps, or qualitative characteristics depending on the nature of the transactions involved. Establishing baseline metrics creates quantitative measures that enable objective assessment of transactional performance, providing data that can inform both compliance evaluation and system improvement.

Creating reference models provides exemplars that illustrate desired transactional patterns, making abstract standards concrete and accessible. These models may take various forms, from detailed case studies to simplified templates that highlight key features. Developing evaluation criteria establishes the basis for judging transactional quality and compliance, creating transparency about how performance will be assessed. These criteria translate general principles into specific indicators that can be observed and measured in practice.

b) **Norm Development**

While standard setting addresses formal aspects of protocols, norm development focuses on creating the shared understanding necessary for effective implementation. Building shared understanding involves communication and education that help participants grasp not only the letter of rules but also their spirit and purpose. This understanding includes both cognitive comprehension of what rules require and normative acceptance of why those requirements matter.

Fostering common practices encourages consistent application of rules across different contexts and participants, creating coherence within the transactional system. These practices emerge through demonstration, imitation, and reinforcement that transform abstract rules into concrete behaviors. Creating cultural alignment connects rules to broader values and identities that motivate compliance beyond mere obligation or self-interest. This alignment embeds rules within meaningful narratives that explain their significance and justify their authority. Establishing expectations clarifies what participants can anticipate from each other and from the system itself, reducing uncertainty and building confidence in transactional outcomes.

c) **Practice Formation**

The formation of practices translates protocols from abstract specifications into lived reality. Implementing procedures creates specific sequences of actions that fulfill rule requirements in concrete situations. These procedures operationalize general principles, showing exactly how rules should be applied in particular contexts. Training participants builds the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for effective rule implementation, ensuring that those involved in transactions understand what is expected and how to meet those expectations.

Building habits transforms conscious rule-following into intuitive practice, reducing the cognitive burden of compliance and increasing consistency. These habits develop through repetition and reinforcement that gradually internalize rule-guided behaviors. Creating routines establishes regular patterns of activity that incorporate rule requirements into everyday practice, making compliance part of normal operations rather than an exceptional effort. These routines coordinate multiple participants and activities, creating predictable sequences that enhance efficiency and reliability.

d) **System Design**

The design of systems creates the infrastructure that supports rule implementation across multiple transactions and contexts. Architecting rule frameworks establishes the overall structure within which specific rules operate, defining relationships between different types and levels of rules. These frameworks provide organization and coherence, ensuring that individual rules work together rather than conflicting or creating gaps. Building infrastructure creates the technical, organizational, and social foundations necessary for rule operation, from physical facilities to digital platforms to institutional arrangements.

Creating support systems provides resources and assistance that help participants navigate rule requirements effectively. These systems may include documentation, consultation services, problem-solving mechanisms, or adaptive tools that facilitate compliance in challenging situations. Developing tools equips participants with specific instruments that enable rule implementation, from simple checklists to sophisticated software applications. These tools translate abstract requirements into practical aids that guide behavior and verify compliance in real-time transactional contexts.

### 2. Enforcement Mechanisms

Enforcement mechanisms ensure that rules actually shape transactional behavior rather than existing merely as nominal requirements. These mechanisms create accountability by detecting deviations, providing feedback, and creating consequences that motivate compliance. Effective enforcement balances consistency with flexibility, maintaining system integrity while accommodating legitimate variation and adaptation.

a) **Monitoring Systems**

Monitoring systems provide visibility into transactional behavior, generating information necessary for effective enforcement. Tracking compliance involves systematic observation of transactions to determine whether they conform to established rules. This tracking may be continuous or periodic, comprehensive or selective, depending on the nature of the transactions and the resources available for monitoring. Measuring performance goes beyond binary compliance assessment to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of rule implementation, providing data that can inform both enforcement actions and system improvements.

Detecting violations identifies specific instances where transactions fail to meet rule requirements, triggering appropriate responses. This detection may rely on automated systems, human oversight, participant reporting, or combinations of these approaches. Gathering data collects information about transactional patterns across multiple instances, enabling analysis that can reveal systemic issues or emerging trends. This broader perspective complements case-by-case monitoring, providing context that helps distinguish isolated incidents from widespread problems.

b) **Correction Processes**

Correction processes respond to identified deviations, restoring compliance and preventing recurrence. Addressing deviations begins with acknowledgment of non-compliance and assessment of its causes and implications. This assessment informs the selection of appropriate corrective measures, which may range from simple clarification to formal sanctions depending on the nature and context of the deviation. Implementing fixes applies specific remedies to resolve non-compliance, whether through technical adjustments, procedural changes, or compensatory actions.

Providing guidance offers direction and support to help participants understand requirements and improve compliance. This guidance may be educational rather than punitive, especially when deviations result from misunderstanding rather than intentional violation. Adjusting behavior focuses on changing patterns of action to align more closely with rule requirements, whether through training, incentives, constraints, or other interventions that influence future conduct.

c) **Feedback Loops**

Feedback loops create circuits of information and response that continuously improve rule implementation. Collecting information gathers data about transactional behavior and outcomes from various sources, including monitoring systems, participant reports, and environmental scanning. This information provides the raw material for enforcement decisions and system improvements. Analyzing patterns examines this information to identify trends, correlations, and causal relationships that reveal how rules are functioning in practice.

Providing responses communicates assessments and expectations back to transaction participants, creating awareness of how their behavior aligns with rule requirements. These responses may include acknowledgment of compliance, notification of deviations, or guidance for improvement. Making adjustments modifies enforcement approaches based on observed results, creating a dynamic system that learns from experience and adapts to changing conditions.

d) **Incentive Structures**

Incentive structures shape motivation for rule compliance by creating consequences that influence behavior. Rewarding compliance provides positive reinforcement for behavior that meets or exceeds rule requirements, making rule-following attractive rather than merely obligatory. These rewards may be tangible (financial benefits, resource access) or intangible (recognition, status, relationship quality) depending on what participants value. Penalizing violations creates negative consequences for non-compliance, establishing costs that discourage rule-breaking.

Creating motivation addresses the underlying reasons why participants would choose to follow rules, connecting compliance with their own goals and values. This motivation may appeal to self-interest, social approval, ethical principles, or other factors that influence decision-making. Aligning interests structures incentives so that participants benefit from rule compliance, reducing conflict between individual advantage and system requirements. This alignment creates conditions where following rules serves participants' own objectives, making compliance a rational choice rather than an externally imposed constraint.

### 3. Adaptation Strategies

Adaptation strategies enable rule systems to evolve in response to changing conditions while maintaining essential functions. These strategies recognize that effective implementation requires ongoing adjustment rather than rigid adherence to initial designs. By incorporating mechanisms for learning and modification, adaptation strategies create resilient systems that remain relevant and effective in dynamic environments.

a) **Context Response**

Context response strategies adjust rules to accommodate changing circumstances that affect transactional systems. Monitoring environmental changes maintains awareness of shifts in technology, markets, social norms, regulations, or other factors that influence transaction contexts. This monitoring provides early warning of conditions that might require rule adaptation. Assessing impact evaluates how these changes affect the functioning of existing rules, identifying areas where current approaches may become ineffective or counterproductive.

Adjusting rules modifies requirements, procedures, or standards to maintain effectiveness in changed conditions. These adjustments may involve reinterpretation of existing rules, addition of new provisions, or elimination of requirements that no longer serve their purpose. Implementing modifications puts adapted rules into practice through appropriate changes to documentation, training, systems, and enforcement mechanisms.

b) **System Flexibility**

System flexibility creates capacity for adaptation without compromising core functions or values. Building in adaptability designs rule systems with features that facilitate modification when needed, such as modular structures, parameter-based requirements, or explicit amendment processes. These features reduce the cost and disruption associated with necessary changes. Creating response options develops alternative approaches that can be deployed in different circumstances, providing flexibility without requiring complete redesign.

Maintaining resilience ensures that systems can withstand stress and disruption while continuing to function effectively. This resilience includes both technical robustness and social capacity to navigate challenges collaboratively. Supporting evolution establishes pathways for gradual transformation that preserve continuity while accommodating change. These evolutionary pathways allow systems to adapt to new conditions without losing connection to their foundational purposes and values.

c) **Innovation Pathways**

Innovation pathways create routes for introducing novel approaches to transaction management. Identifying opportunities recognizes potential areas for improvement or innovation based on emerging needs, technologies, or insights. This identification may come from systematic review, participant feedback, or creative exploration of possibilities. Testing new approaches creates controlled environments where innovations can be evaluated without disrupting the entire system, generating evidence about effectiveness and implications.

Implementing improvements introduces validated innovations into actual practice, translating promising ideas into operational reality. This implementation requires attention to both technical functionality and social acceptance, ensuring that innovations work as intended and gain necessary support. Scaling solutions expands successful innovations from limited applications to broader implementation, adapting them as needed for different contexts while maintaining their essential features.

d) **Evolution Patterns**

Evolution patterns describe how rule systems change over time through cumulative adaptation and innovation. Managing change coordinates multiple modifications to maintain coherence and prevent conflicts or gaps that might emerge from uncoordinated adjustments. This management includes attention to sequencing, timing, and communication that helps participants navigate transitions effectively. Supporting growth enables systems to expand in scope, scale, or complexity while maintaining integrity and effectiveness.

Facilitating development nurtures the emergence of new capabilities and functions that enhance transactional value. This facilitation includes creating conditions that encourage experimentation, learning, and collaboration among participants. Enabling transformation supports more fundamental changes in system purpose, structure, or operation when circumstances require substantial reinvention rather than incremental adaptation. These transformations maintain connection to core values while reimagining how they can be realized in new contexts.

## Implications for Transaction Management

The analysis of rule-following in transactions reveals several key insights that have significant implications for how we approach transaction management across various domains. These insights challenge conventional understandings of rules as mere constraints and offer a more nuanced perspective on their role in enabling meaningful exchange.

First, rules are not merely constraints but enabling structures that make meaningful transactions possible. Without the shared understanding and predictable patterns that rules provide, transactions would dissolve into incoherent interactions lacking purpose or value. This enabling function suggests that effective transaction management should focus not on minimizing rules but on designing rule systems that create maximum transactional possibility with minimum unnecessary constraint. The goal becomes creating what Wittgenstein might call "forms of life" within which transactions can flourish.

Second, effective rule systems must balance stability with adaptability. Stability provides the predictability and reliability necessary for participants to engage confidently in transactions, knowing that their understanding of the system will remain valid over time. Adaptability ensures that rules can evolve in response to changing conditions, maintaining relevance and effectiveness as contexts shift. This balance requires thoughtful design of both the content of rules and the meta-rules that govern how they change, creating systems that are neither rigidly fixed nor chaotically fluid.

Third, implementation requires attention to both explicit and implicit aspects of rule-following. While formal documentation and enforcement mechanisms matter, they represent only part of what makes rules effective in practice. Equally important are the shared understandings, cultural norms, and tacit knowledge that guide interpretation and application in specific contexts. Effective implementation addresses both dimensions, recognizing that written protocols gain meaning and force through their embedding in social practices.

Fourth, evolution of rules is essential for maintaining system relevance and effectiveness. As contexts change, rules must adapt to remain meaningful and functional. This evolution is not a sign of weakness or failure but a necessary characteristic of healthy rule systems. Effective transaction management therefore includes mechanisms for learning, adaptation, and innovation that enable rules to develop in response to experience and changing conditions.

These insights provide a foundation for understanding how rules shape and enable transactions, while also highlighting the importance of careful rule design and management in transactional systems. By recognizing the complex, practice-based nature of rule-following, we can develop more effective approaches to transaction management that harness the power of rules to create meaningful, valuable exchanges. The next section will examine how context interacts with these rule systems to create meaning in transactions.
