Part I 
The Proposition and its Sense 


1 How can one talk about “understanding” and “not under- 
standing” a proposition? 
Surely it’s not a proposition until it’s understood ? 39 


2 Understanding and signs. Frege against the formalists. Under- 
standing like seeing a picture that makes all the rules clear; in that 
case the picture is itself a sign, a calculus. 

“To understand a language’’—to take in a symbolism as a 
whole. 

Language must speak for itself. 39 


3 One can say that meaning drops out of language. 
In contrast: “Did you mean that seriously or as a joke?” 
When we mean (and don’t just say) words it seems to us as if 
there were something coupled to the words. 41 


4 Comparison with understanding a piece of music: for explana- 
tion I can only translate the musical picture into a picture in 
another medium - and why just ¢af picture? Comparison with 
understanding a picture. Perhaps we see only patches and lines — 
“we do not understand the picture”. Seeing a genre-picture in 
different ways. 41 


5 “I understand that gesture” — it says something. 

Ina sentence a word can be felt as belonging first with one word 
and then with another. 

A ‘proposition’ may be what is conceived in different ways or 
the way of conceiving itself. 


A sentence from the middle of a story I have not read. 
The concept of understanding is a fluid one. 42 


6 A sentence in a code: at what moment of translating does under- 
standing begin ? 

The words of a sentence are arbitrary; so I replace them with 
letters. But now I cannot immediately think the sense of the 
sentence in the new expression. 

The notion that we can only imperfectly exhibit our under- 
standing: the expression of understanding has something missing 
that is essentially inexpressible. But in that case it makes no sense to 
speak of a more complete expression. 43 


7 What is the criterion for an expression’s being meant ‘hus? A 
question about the relationship between two linguistic expressions. 
Sometimes a translation into another mode of representation. 45 


8 Must I understand a sentence to be able to act on it? If “to 
understand a sentence” means somehow or other to act on it, then 
understanding cannot be a precondition for our acting on it. - 
What goes on when I suddenly understand someone else ? There 
are many possibilities here. 45 


9 Isn’t there a gap between an order and its execution? “I under- 
stand it, but only because I add something to it, namely the inter- 
pretation.” — But if one were to say “any sentence still stands in 
need of an interpretation”, that would mean: no sentence can be 
understood without a rider. 46 


to “Understanding a word” ~ being able to apply it. - “When I 
said “I can play chess’ I really could.”” How did I know that I 
could ? My answer will show in what way I use the word “‘can’’. 
Being able is called a s/ate. ‘To describe a state” can mean various 
things. “After all I can’t have the whole mode of application of a 
word in my head ail at once.” 47 


11 It is not a question of an instantaneous grasping. — 

When a man who knows the game watches a game of chess, the 
experience he has when a move is made usually differs from that of 
someone else watching without understanding the game. But this 
experience is not the knowledge of the rules. - The understanding 
of language seems like a background; like the abi/ity to multiply. 


12 When do we understand a sentence ? — When we’ve uttered the 
whole of it? Or while uttering it? 50 


13, When someone interprets, or understands, a sign in one sense 
or another, what he is doing is taking a step in a calculus. — 
“Thought” sometimes means a process which may accompany the 
utterance of a sentence and sometimes the sentence itself in the 
system of language. 50 


II 


14 Grammar as (e.g.) the geometry of negation. We would like to 
say: “Negation has the property that when it is doubled it yields an 
affirmation”. But the rule doesn’t give a further description of 
negation, it constitutes negation. 52 


15 Geometry no more speaks about cubes than logic does about 


negation. 
It looks as if one could zzfer from the meaning of negation that 
“~~ p” means p. 52 


16 What does it mean to say that the “‘is”’ in ‘““The rose is red” has a 
different meaning from the “‘is”’ in “twice two is four” ? Here we 
have. one word but as it were different meaning-bodies with a 
single end surface: different possibilities of constructing sentences. 
The comparison of the glass cubes. The rule for the arrangement of 
the red sides contains the possibilities, i.e. the geometry of the 
cube. The cube can also serve as a notation for the rule if it belongs 
to a system of propositions. 53 


17 “The grammatical possibilities of the negation-sign”. The 
T-F notation can illustrate the meaning of “not”. The written 
symbol becomes a sign for negation only by the way it works — the 
way it is used in the game. 55 


18 If we derive geometrical propositions from a drawing or a 
model, then the model has the role of a sign in a game. We use the 
drawing of a cube again and again in different contexts. It is this 
sign that we take to be the cube in which the geometrical laws are 
already laid up. 55 


19 My earlier concept of meaning originates in a primitive 
philosophy of language. — Augustine on the learning of language. 
He describes a calculus of our language, only not everything that 
we call language is this calculus. 56 


20 As if words didn’t also have functions quite different from the 
naming of tables, chairs, etc.- Here is the origin of the bad 
expression: a fact is a complex of objects. 57 


21 In a familiar language we experience different parts of speech 
as different. It is only in a foreign language that we see clearly the 
uniformity of words. 58 


22 If I decide to use a new word instead of “‘red”, how would it 
come out that it took the place of the word “red”? 59 


23 The meaning of a word: what the explanation of its meaning 
explains. (If, on the other hand by “meaning” we mean a charac- 
teristic sensation, then the explanation of meaning would be a 
cause.) 59 


24 Explanation can clear up misunderstandings. In that case 
understanding is a correlate of explanation. — Definitions. 

It seems as if the other grammatical rules for a word had to follow 
from its ostensive definition. But is this definition really unam- 
biguous ? One must understand a great deal of a language in order 
to understand the definition. 60 
25 The words “shape’’, “colour” in the definitions determine the 
kind of use of the word. The ostensive definition has a different role 
in the grammar of each part of speech. 61 


26 So how does it come about that on the strength of this defi- 
nition we understand the word? 

What’s the sign of someone’s understanding a game? Can’t he 
learn a game simply by watching it being played? Learning and 
speaking without explicit rules. We are always comparing language 
with a game according to rules. 61 


27 Thenames I give to bodies, shapes, colours, lengths have differ- 
ent grammars in each case. The meaning of a name is not the thing 
we point to when we give an ostensive definition of thename. 63 


28 What constitutes the meaning of a word like “perhaps”’? 

I know how it is used. The case is similar when someone is 
explaining to me a calculation “that I don’t quite understand”’. 
“Now I know how to go on.” How do I know that I know how 
to go on? 64 


29 Is the meaning really only the use of the word? Isn’t it the way 
this use meshes with our life ? 65 


30 The words “fine” ,“oh”, “perhaps’”...can each be the 
expression of a feeling. But I don’t call that feeling the meaning of 
the word. 


I can replace the sensations by intonation and gestures. 
I could also treat the word (e.g. “oh’’) itself as a gesture. 66 


31 A language spoken in a uniform metre. 

Relationships between tools in a toolbox. 

“The meaning of a word: its role in the calculus of language.” 
Imagine how we calculate with “red”. And then: the word 
“oh” — what corresponds now to the calculus ? 67 


32 Describing ball-games. Perhaps one will be unwilling to call 
some of them ball-games; but it is clear where the boundary is to 
be drawn here? 

We consider language from one point of view only. 

The explanation of the purpose or the effect of a word is not 
what we call the explanation of its meaning. It may be that if it is 
to achieve its effect a particular word cannot be replaced by any 
other, just as it may be that a gesture cannot be replaced by any 
other. - We only bother about what’s called the explanation of 
meaning and not about meaning in any other sense. 68 


33 Aren’t our sentences parts of a mechanism? As in a pianola? 
But suppose it is in bad condition? So it is not the effect but the 
purpose that is the sense of the signs (the holes in the pianola roll). 
Their purpose within the mechanism. 

We need an explanation that is part of the calculus. 

“A symbol is something that produces this effect.”” - How do I 
know that it is the one I meant?” 

We could use a colour-chart: and then our calculus would have 
to get along with the visible colour-sample. 69 


34 “We could understand a penholder too, if we had given it a 
meaning.” Does the understanding contain the whole system of its 
application ? 


When I read a sentence with understanding something happens: 
perhaps a picture comes into my mind. But before we call “under- 
standing”’ is related to countless things that happen before and 
after the reading of ¢his sentence. 

When I don’t understand a sentence —that can be different 
things in different cases. 

“Understanding a word” — that is infinitely various. 71 


35 “Understanding” is not the name ofa single process but of more 
or less interrelated processes against a background of the actual 
use of a learnt language. — We think that if I use the word “under- 
standing”’ in all these cases there must be some one thing that 
happens in all of them. Well, the concept-word certainly does show 
a kinship but this need not be the sharing of a common property 
or constituent. — The concept-word “‘game’’. “By ‘knowledge’ we 
mean these processes, and these, and s¢mi/ar ones.” 74 


III 


36 If for our purposes we wish to regulate the use of a word by 
definite rules, then alongside its fluctuating use we set a different 
use. But this isn’t like the way physics gives a simplified descrip- 
tion of a natural phenomenon. It is not as if we were saying 
something that would hold only of an ideal language. 77 


37 We understand a genre-picture if we recognize what the people 
in it are doing. If this recognition does not come easily, there is a 
period of doubt followed by a familiar process of recognition. If 
on the other hand we take it in at first glance it is difficult to say 
what the understanding — the recognition say — consists of. There 
is no one thing that happens that could be called recognition. 

If I want to say “I understand it “ke that’? then the “‘/ike that” 
stands for a translation into a different expression. Or is it a sort of 
intransitive understanding ? 77 


38 Forgetting the meaning of a word. Different cases. The man 
feels, as he looks at blue objects, that the connection between the 
word “blue” and the colour has been broken off. We might restore 
the connection in various ways. The connection is not made by a 
single phenomenon, but can manifest itself in very various pro- 
cesses. Do I mean then that there is no such thing as understanding 
but only manifestations of understanding ? ~ a senseless question. 


79 


39 How does an ostensive definition work ? Is it put to work again 
every time the word is used? Definition as a part of the calculus 
acts only by being applied. 80 


40 In what cases shall we say that the man understands the word 
“blue” ? In what circumstances will 4e be able to say it? or to say 
that he understood it in the past ? 

Ifhe says “I picked the ball out by guesswork, I didn’t understand 
the word”, ought we to believe him? “He can’t be wrong if he 
says that he didn’t understand the word”: a remark on the grammar 
of the statement “I didn’t understand the word”’. 81 


41 We call understanding a mental state, and characterize it as a 
hypothetical process. Comparison between the grammar of mental 
processes and the grammar of brain processes. 

In certain circumstances both our picking out a red object from 
others on demand and our being able to give the ostensive defi- 
nition of the word “red” are regarded as signs of understanding. 

We aren’t interested here in the difference between thinking out 
loud (or in writing) and thinking in the imagination. 

What we call ‘‘understanding” is not the behaviour that shows us 
the understanding, but a state of which this behaviour is a sign. 

82 


12 


42 We might call the recital of the rules on its own a criterion of 
understanding, or alternatively tests of use on their own. Or we 
may regard the recital of the rules as a symptom of the man’s 
being able to do something other than recite the rules. 

To understand = to let a proposition work on one. 

When one remembers the meaning of a word, the remembering 
is not the mental process that one imagines at first sight. 

The psychological process of understanding is in the same case 
as the arithmetical object Three. 84 


43 An explanation, a chart, is first used by being looked up, then 
by being looked up in the head, and finally as if it had never existed. 

A tule as the cause or history behind our present behaviour is of 
no interest to us. But a rule can be a hypothesis, or can itself enter 
into the conduct of the game. If a disposition is hypothesized in 
the player to give the list of rules on request, it is a disposition 
analogous to a physiological one. In our study of symbolism there 
is no foreground and background. 85 


44 What interests ws in the sign is what is embodied in the gram- 
mar of the sign. 87 


IV 


45 The ostensive definition of signs is not an application of lan- 
guage, but part of the grammar: something like a rule for transla- 
tion froma gesture language into a word-language. — What belongs 
to grammar are all the conditions necessary for comparing the 
proposition with reality -all the conditions necessary for its 
sense. 88 


46 Does our language consist of primary signs (gestures) and 
secondary signs (words) ? 

Obviously we would not be able to replace an ordinary sentence 
by gestures. 


13 


“Ts it an accident that in order to define the signs I have to go 
outside the written and spoken signs ?”’ In that case isn’t it strange 
that I can do anything at all with the written signs ? 88 


47 We say that a red label is the primary sign for the colour red, 
and the word a secondary sign. — But must a Frenchman have a 
red image present to his mind when he understands my explana- 
tion “red = rouge”? 89 


48 Are the primary signs incapable of being misinterpreted ? Can 
one say they don’t any longer need to be understood? 90 


49 Acolour chart might be arranged differently or used differently, 
and yet the words mean the same colours as with us. 

Cana green label be a sample of red? 

Can it be said that when someone is painting a certain shade of 
green he is copying the red of a label? 

A sample is not used like a name. go 


50 “Copy” can mean various things. Various methods of com- 
parison. 

We do not understand what is meant by “this shade of colour is 
a copy of this note on the violin.” It makes no sense to speak of a 
projection-method for association. gI 


51 We can say that we communicate by signs whether we use 
words or samples, but the game of acting in accordance with 
words is different from the game of acting in accordance with 
samples. 92 


52 “There must be some sort of law for reading the chart. — Other- 
wise how would one know how the table was to be used ?” It is part of 
human nature to understand pointing with the finger in the way 
we do. 

The chart does not compel me to use it always in the same way. 


93 


14 


53 Is the word “red” enough to enable one to look for something 
red? Does one need a memory image to do so? 

An order. Is the real order “Do now what you remember doing 
then?” 

If the colour sample appears darker than 1 remember it being 
yesterday, I need not agree with my memory. 94 


54 “Paint from memory the colour of the door of your room” 
is no more unambiguous than “paint the green you see on this 
chart.” 

I see the colour of the flower and recognize /t. 

Even if I say “‘no, this colour is brighter than the one I saw there,” 
there is no process of comparing two simultaneously given shades 
of colour. 

Think of reading aloud from a written test (or writing to dic- 
tation). 95 


55 “Why do you choose “sis colour when given this order?” - 
“Because shis colour is opposite to the word ‘red’ in my chart.” 
In that case there is no sense in ¢his question: “Why do you call 
‘red’ the colour in the chart opposite the word ‘red’ ?” 

The connection between “language and reality” is made by 
definitions of words — which belong to grammar. 96 


56 A gesture language used to communicate with people who have 
no word-language in common with us. Do we feel there too the 
need to go outside language to explain its signs ? 

The correlation between objects and names is a part of the 
symbolism. It gives the wrong idea if you say that the connection 
is a psychological one. 97 


57 Someone copies a figure on the scale of 1 to 10. Is the under- 
standing of the general rule of such mapping contained in the 
process of copying ? 


15 


Or was the process merely in agreement with that rule, but also in 
agreement with other rules ? 97 


58 Even if my pencil doesn’t always do justice to the model, my 
intention always does. 98 


59 For our studies it can never be essential that a symbolic phe- 
nomenon occurs in the mind and not on paper. 

An explanation of a sign can replace the sign itself — this con- 
trasts with causal explanation. 99 


60 Reading. ~ Deriving a translation from the original may also 
be a visible process. 

Always what represents is the system in which a sign is used. 

If ‘mental’ processes can be true and false, their descriptions 
must be able to as well. 99 


61 Every case of deriving an action from a command is the same 
kind of thing as the written derivation of a result. 

“I write the number ‘16’ here because it says ‘x’ there.” 

It might appear that some causality was operating here, but that 
would be a confusion between ‘reason’ and ‘cause’. 101 


V 


62 “That’s dim’ — that contains the whole problem of representa- 
tion. 

I make a plan: I see myself acting thus and so. “How do I 
know that it’s myself?” Or “How do I know that the word ‘P 
stands for me?” . 

The delusion that in thought the objects do what the proposition 
states about them. 

“T meant the victor of Austerlitz” — the past tense, which looks 
as if it was giving a description, is deceptive. 102 


16 


63 “How does one think a proposition? How does thought use 
its expression 2?” 

Let’s compare belief with the utterance of a sentence: the pro- 
cesses in the larynx etc. accompany the spoken sentence which alone 
interests us — not as part of a mechanism, but as part of a calculus. 

We think we can’t describe thought after the event because the 
delicate processes have been lost sight of. 

What is the function of thought ? Its effect does not interest us. 


103 


64 But if thinking consists only in writing or speaking, why 
shouldn’t a machine do it? 

Could a machine be in pain? 

It is a travesty of the truth to say: thinking is an activity of our 
mind, as writing is an activity of the hand. 105 


65 ‘Thinking’ ‘Language’ are fluid concepts. 

The expression “mental process” is meant to distinguish 
‘experience’ from ‘physical processes’; or else we talk of ‘uncon- 
scious thoughts’ — of processes in a mind-model; or else the word 
“thought” is taken as synonymous with “sense of asentence”’. 106 


66 The idea that one language in contrast to others can have an 
order of words which corresponds to the order of thinking. 

Is it, as it were, a contamination of the sense that we express it in 
a particular language? Does it impair the rigour and purity of the 
Proposition 25 x 25 = 625 that it is written down in a particular 
number system ? 

Thought can only be something common-or-garden. But we 
are affected by this concept as we are by that of the number one. 107 


67 What does man think for ? There is no such thing as a “thought- 


17 


experiment’’. I believe that more boilers would explode if people 
did not calculate when making boilers. Does it follow that there 
will in fact be fewer ? The belief that fire will burn me is of the same 
nature as the fear that it will burn me. 109 


68 My assumption that this house won’t collapse may be the 
utterance of a sentence which is part of a calculation. I do have 
reasons for it. What counts as a reason for an assumption deter- 
mines a calculus. - So is the calculus something we adopt arbi- 
trarily > No more so than the fear of fire. 

As long as we remain in the province of true-false games a 
change of grammar can only lead us from one game to another, 
and never from something true to something false. 110 


VI 


69 What is a proposition ? — Do we havea single general concept of 
proposition ? 112 


jo “What happens when a sew proposition is taken into the 
language: what is the criterion for its being a proposition?” 

In this respect the concept of number is like the concept of propo- 
sition. On the other hand the concept of cardinal number can be 
called a rigorously circumscribed concept, that’s to say it’s a 
concept in a different sense of the word. 113 


71 I possess the concept ‘language’ from the languages I have 
learnt. “But language can expand”: if “expand” makes sense here, 
I must now be able to specify how I imagine such an expansion. 

No sign leads us beyond itself. 

Does every newly constructed language broaden the concept of 
language ? - Comparison with the concept of number. 114 


18 


72 The indeterminacy of generality is not a logical indeterminacy. 

The task of philosophy is not to create an ideal language, but to 
clarify the use of existing language. 

I’m allowed to use the word “rule” without first tabulating the 
tules for the word.—If philosophy was concerned with the 
concept of the calculus of all calculi, there would be such a thing 
as metaphilosophy. But there is not. 115 


73 It isn’t on the strength of a particular property, the property of 
being a rule, that we speak of the rules of a game. — We use the 
word “rule” in contrast to “word”, “projection” and some other 
words. 116 


74 We learnt the meaning of the word “plant” by examples. And 
if we disregard hypothetical dispositions, these examples stand 
only for themselves. — 

The grammatical pace of the word “game” “rule” etc is given 
by examples in rather the way in which the place of a meeting is 
specified by saying that it will take place beside such and such a 
tree. 117 


75 Meaning as something which comes before our minds when we 
hear a word. 

“Show the children a game”’. 

The sentence “The Assyrians knew various games’? would 
strike us as curious since we wouldn’t be certain that we could give 
an example. 118 


76 Examples of the use of the word “wish’’. Our aim is not to give 
a theory of wishing, which would have to explain every case of 
wishing. 

The use of the words “proposition”, “language”, etc. has the 
haziness of the normal use of concept-words in our language. 119 


77 The philosophy of logic speaks of sentences and words in the 
sense in which we speak of them in ordinary life. 


19 


(We are not justified in having any more scruples about our 
language than the chess player has about chess, namely none.) 121 


78 Sounding like a sentence. We don’t call everything ‘that sounds 
like a sentence’ a sentence. -If we disregard sounding like a 
sentence do we still have a general concept of proposition ? 

The example of a language in which the order of the words in a 
sentence is the reverse of the present one. 122 


79 The definition “A proposition is whatever can be true or false”. 
— The words “true” and “‘false” are items in a particular notation 
P 
for the truth-functions. 
Does “‘ ‘p’ is true” state anything about the sign ‘p’ ? 12 
y g g 3 


80 In the schema “This is how things stand” the “how things 
stand”’ is a handle for the truth-functions. 

A general propositional form determines a proposition as part 
of a calculus. 124 


81 The rules that say that such and such a combination of words 
yields no sense. 

“How do I know that red can’t be cut into bits ?” is not a ques- 
tion. I must begin with the distinction between sense and nonsense. 
I can’t give it a foundation, 125 


82 “ How must we make the grammatical rules for words if they 
are to give a sentence sense ?” — 

A proposition shows the possibility of the state of affairs it 
describes. “Possible” here means the same as “conceivable”; 
representable in a particular system of propositions. 

The proposition “I can imagine such and such a colour tran- 
sition connects the linguistic representation with another form of 
representation; it is a proposition of grammar. 127 


83 It looks as if we could say: Word-language allows of senseless 


combinations of words, but the language of imagining does not 
allow us to imagine anything senseless. 


20 


“Can you imagine it’s being otherwise ?” — How strange that 
one should be able to say that such and such a state of affairs is 
inconceivable! 128 


84 The role of a proposition in the calculus is its sense. 
It is only in language that something is a proposition. To 
understand a proposition is to understand a language. 130 


Vil 


85 Symbols appear to be of their nature unsatisfied. 
A proposition seems to demand that reality be compared with it. 
“A proposition like a ruler laid against reality.” 132 


86 Ifyou see the expression of an expectation you see what is being 
expected. 
It looks as if the ultimate thing sought by an order had to remain 
unexpressed. ~ As if the sign was trying to communicate with us. 
A sign does its job only in a grammatical system. 132 


87 It seems as if the expectation and the fact satisfying the expecta- 
tion fitted together somehow. Solids and hollows. — Expectation 
is not related to its satisfaction in the same way as hunger is related 
to its satisfaction. 133 


88 The strange thing that the event I expected isn’t distinct from 
the one IJ expected. — “The report was not so loud as I had expec- 
ted.” 

“How can you say that the red which you see in front of you is 
the same as the red you imagined ?”’ — One takes the meaning of the 
word “red” as being the sense of a proposition saying that some- 
thing is red. 134 


89 A red patch looks different from one that is not red. But it 
would be odd to say “a red patch looks different when it is there 
from when it isn’t there”. Or: “How do you know that you are 
expecting a red patch?” 135 


21 


go How can I expect the event, when it isn’t yet there at all? — 
I can imagine a stag that is not there, in this meadow, but not kill 
one that is not there. — It is not the expected thing that is the ful- 
filment, but rather its coming about. It is difficult for us to shake 
off this comparison: a man makes his appearance — an event makes 


its appearance. 136 


91 A search for a particular thing (e.g. my stick) is a particular 
kind of search, and differs from a search for something else because 
of what one does (says, thinks) while searching, not because of 


what one finds. - Contrast looking for the trisection of the angle. 
138 


92 The symptoms of expectation are not the expression of expec- 
tation. 

In the sentence “I expect that he is coming” is one using the 
words “‘he is coming”’ in a different sense from the one they have 
in the assertion “he is coming”? 

What makes it the expectation precisely of him? 

Various definitions of “expecting a person X”’. 

It isn’t a later experience that decides what we ate expecting. 
“Tet us put the expression of expectation in place of the expecta- 
tion.” 138 


93 Expectation as preparatory behaviour. 
“Expectation is a thought” 
If hunger is called a wish it is a hypothesis that just that will 


satisfy the wish. 
In “I have been expecting him all day” “expect”? does not mean 


a persistent condition. 140 


94 When I expect someone, — what happens ? 
What does the process of wanting to eat an apple consistin? 141 


22 


95 Intention and intentionality. — 

“The thought that p is the case doesn’t presuppose that it is the 
case; yet I can’t think that something is red if the colour red does 
not exist.”” Here we mean the existence of a red sample as part of our 
language. 142 


96 It’s beginning to look somehow as if intention could never be 
recognized as intention from the outside. But the point is that one 
has to read off from a thought that it is the thought that such and 
such is the case. 143 


97 This is connected with the question whether a machine could 
think. This is like when we say: “The will can’t be a phenomenon, 
for whatever phenomenon you take is something that simply 
happens, not something we do.” But there’s no doubt that you also 
have experiences when you move your arm voluntarily, although 
the phenomena of doing are indeed different from the pheno- 
mena of observing. But there are very different cases here. 144 


98 The intention seems to interpret, to give the final interpretation. 

Imagine an ‘abstract’ sign-language translated into an un- 
ambiguous picture-language. Here there seem to be no further 
possibilities of interpretation. — We might say we didn’t enter into 
the sign-language but did enter into the painted picture. Exam- 
ples: picture, cinema, dream. 145 


99 What happens is not that this symbol cannot be further inter- 
preted, but: I do no interpreting. 

I imagine N. No interpretation accompanies this image; what 
gives the image its interpretation is the path on which it lies. 147 


too We want to say: “Meaning is essentially a mental process, not 


a process in dead matter.” — What we are dissatisfied with here is 
the grammar of process, not the specific kind of process. 148 


23 


ror Doesn’t the system of language provide me with a medium 
in which the proposition is no longer dead? — “Even if the 
expression of the wish is the wish, still the whole language isn’t 
present during this expression.” But that is not necessary. 149 


102 In the gesture we don’t see the real shadow of the fulfilment, 
the unambiguous shadow that admits of no further interpretation. 
149 


103 It’s only considering the linguistic manifestation of a wish 
that makes it appear that my wish prefigures the fulfilment. — 
Because it’s the wish that just that were the case. — It is in language 
that wish and fulfilment meet. 150 


104 “A proposition isn’t a mere series of sounds, it is something 
more.” Don’t I see a sentence as part of a system of consequences ? 
152 


105 “This queer thing, thought.” — It strikes us as queer when we 
say that it connects objects in the mind. — We’re all ready to pass 
from it to the reality. — “How was it possible for thought to deal 
with the very person himself?” Here I am being astonished by my 
own linguistic expression and momentarily misunderstanding 
it. 154 


106 “When I think of what will happen tomorrow I am mentally 
already in the future.” — Similarly people think that the endless 
series of cardinal numbers is somehow before our mind’s eye, 
whenever we can use that expression significantly. 

A thought experiment is like a drawing of an experiment that is 
not carried out. 155 


107 We said “one cannot recognize intention as intention from 
the outside” — i.e. that it is not something that happens, or happens 
to us, but something we do. It is almost as if we said: we cannot see 
ourselves going to a place, because it is we who are doing the 
going. One does have a particular experience if one is doing the 
going oneself. 156 


24 


108 Fulfilment of expectation doesn’t consist in some third thing’s 
happening, such as a feeling of satisfaction. 157 


Vill 


109 A description of language must achieve the same result as 
language itself. 

Suppose someone says that one can infer from a propsotion the 
fact that verifies it. What can one infer from a proposition apart 
from itself? : 

The shadowy anticipation of a fact consists in our being able 


already to think that that very thing will happen which hasn’t yet 
happened. 1 59 


110 However many steps I insert between the thought and its 
application, each intermediate step always follows the previous 
one without any intermediate link, and so too the application 
follows the last intermediate step. - We can’t cross the bridge to the 
execution (of an order) until we are there. 160 


111 It is the calculus of thought that connects with extra-mental 
reality. From expectation to fulfilment is a step in a calculation. 


160 


112 We are — as it were ~ surprised, not at anyone’s knowing the 
future, but at his being able to prophesy at all (right or wrong). 161 


IX 


113 Is the pictorial character of thought an agreement with reality ? 
In what sense can I say that a proposition is a picture ? 163 


114 The sense of a proposition and the sense of a picture. The 
different grammar of the expressions: 


25 


; ee 
“This picture shows people at a village inn. ena a 
“This picture shows the coronation of Napoleon. 


115 A picture’s telling me something will consist in my recog- 
nizing in it objects in some sort of characteristic arrangement. — 
What does “this object is familiar to me” mean? 165 


116 “I see what I see.” I say that because I don’t want to give a 
name to what I see. — I want to exclude from my consideration of 
familiarity everything that is ‘historical’. - The multiplicity 
familiarity is that of feeling at home in what I see. 165 


117 Understanding a genre picture: don’t we ope oe the painted 

people as people and the painted trees as trees, etc. ? css 
A picture of a human face is a no less familiar object than is 

human face itself. But there is no question of recognition here. 1 


118 The false concept that recognizing always consists 1n com- 
i i i ith one another. — 
ating two impressions with o . 
: “We couldn’t use words at all if we didn’t recognize them and the 
objects they denote.” Have we any sort of check on this was 
oe 167 
nition ? 
119 This shape I see is not simply a shape, but is one of the ane 
I know. — But it is not as if I were comparing the object with a 


picture set beside it, but as if the object coincided with the picture. 


i 68 
I see only one thing, not two. I 


120 “This face has a quite particular expression.” We perhaps ei 
for words and feel that everyday language is here too crude. 169 


26 


121 Thata picture tells me something consists in its own form and 
colours. Or it narrates something to me: it uses words so to speak, 
and I am comparing the picture with a combination of linguistic 
forms. ~ That a series of signs tells me something isn’t constituted 
by its now making this impression on me. “It’s only in a language 


that something is a proposition.” 169 
122 ‘Language’ is languages. -— Languages are systems. 
It is units of languages that I call “propositions”. 170 


123 Certainly, I read a story and don’t give a hang about any 
system of language, any more than if it was a story in pictures. 
Suppose we were to say at this point “something is a picture only 
in a picture-language.” ? 171 


124 We might imagine a language in whose use the impression 
made on us by the signs played no part. 
What I calla “proposition” is a position in the game of language. 
Thinking is an activity, like calculating. 171 


125 A puzzle picture. What does it amount to to say that after the 


solution the picture means something to us, whereas it meant 
nothing before ? 


172 
126 The impression is one thing, and the impression’s being 
determinate is another thing. The impression of familiarity is 


perhaps the characteristics of the determinacy that every strong 
impression has. 174. 


127 Can I think away the impression of individual familiarity 
where it exists; and think it into a situation where it does not? 
The difficulty is not a psychological one. We have not determined 
what that is to mean. 

Can I look at a printed English word and see it as if I hadn’t 
learnt to read? 


I can ascribe meaning to a meaningless shape. 175 


27 


128 We can read courage into a face and say “now once more 
courage fits this face”. This is related to “an attributive adjective 
agrees with the subject”. 

What do I do if I take a smile now as a kind one, now as mali- 
cious? This is connected with the contrast between saying and 


meaning. 176 


129 A friendly mouth, friendly eyes, the wagging of a dog’s tail 
are primary symbols of friendliness: they are parts of the pheno- 
mena that are called friendliness. If we want to imagine further 
appearances as expressions of friendliness, we read these symbols 
into them. It is not that I can imagine that this man’s face might 
change so that it looked courageous, but that there is a quite 
definite way in which it can change into a courageous face. 

Think of the multifariousness of what we call “language”: 
word-language, picture-language, gesture-language, sound-lan- 
guage. 178 


130 “ “This object is familiar to me’ is like saying ‘this object is 
portrayed in my catalogue’.” We are making the assumption that 
the picture in our catalogue is itself familiar. 

The sheath in my mind as a “form of imagining”. - The pattern 
is no longet presented as an object, which means that it didn’t make 
sense to talk of a pattern at all. 

“Familiarity: an object’s fitting into a sheath” — that’s not quite 
the same as our comparing what is seen with a copy. 

The question is “What do I recognize as what?” For “to recog- 
nize a thing as itself” is meaningless. 179 


131 The comparison between memory and a notebook. 

How did I read off from the memory image that I stood thus at 
the window yesterday? What made you so certain when you spoke 
those words ? Nothing; I was certain. 

How do I react to a memory? 181 


132 Operating with written signs and operating with “imagina- 
tion pictures”’. 


28 


An attitude to a picture (to a thought) is what connects it with 


reality. 
ae 182 


133 Grammatical rules determine a meaning and are not answer- 
able to any meaning that they could contradict. 

Why don’t I call cookery rules arbitrary, and why am I tempted 
to call the rules of grammar arbitrary ? 

‘ 

I don’t call an argument good just because it has the conse- 
quences I want. 

The rules of grammar are arbitrary in the same sense as the 
choice of a unit of measurement. 184 


134 Doesn’t grammar put the primary colours together because 
there is a kind of similarity between them ? Or colours, anyway, in 
contrast to shapes or notes? 
The rules of grammar cannot be justified by shewing that their 
application makes a representation agree with reality. 
The analogy between grammar and games. 185 


135 Langauge considered as a part of a psychological mechanism. 
I do not use “this is the sign for sugar” in the same way as the 
sentence “if I press this button, I get a piece of sugar’. 187 


136 Suppose we compare grammar to a keyboard which I can use 
to direct a man by pressing different combinations of keys. What 
corresponds in this case to the grammar of language ? 

If the utterance of a ‘nonsensical’ combination of words has the 
effect that the other person stares at me, I don’t on that account 
call it the order to stare. 188 


29 


137 Language is not defined for us as an arrangement fulfilling 
a definite purpose. 189 


138 Grammar consists of conventions — say ina chart. This might 
be a part of a mechanism. But it is the connection and not the effect 
which determines the meaning. 

Can one speak of a grammar in the case where a language is 
taught to a person by a mere drill? 190 


139 I do not scruple to é#vent causal connections in the mechanism 
of language. 

To invent a keyboard might mean to invent something that had 
the desired effect; or else to devise new forms which were similar 
to the old ones in various ways. 

“Tt is always for living beings that signs exist.” 191 


140 Inventing a language — inventing an instrument — inventing 
a game. 

If we imagine a goal for chess — say entertainment — then the 
rules are not arbitrary. So too for the choice of a unit of measure- 
ment. 

We can’t say “without language we couldn’t communicate with 
one another”. The concept of language is contained in the concept 
of communication. 192 


141 Philosophy is philosophical problems. Their common element 
extends as far as the common element in different regions of our 
language. 

Something that at first sight looks like a proposition and is not 
one. Something that looks like a design for a steamroller and is not 
one. 193 


ce 


142 Are we willing to call a series of independent signals “‘a 
language” ? 

Imagine a diary kept with signals. Are explanations given so that 
the signals are connected to another language ? 


30 


A language consisting of commands. We wouldn’t say that a 
series of such signals alone would enable me to derive a picture of 
the movement of a man obeying them unless in addition to the 
signal there is something that might be called a general rule for 
translating into drawing. 


The grammar explains the meaning of the signs and thus makes 


the language pictorial. 194

Part I 


The Proposition and its Sense 


1 How can one talk about ‘understanding’ and ‘not under- 
standing’ a proposition? Surely it is not a proposition until it’s 
understood ? 


Does it make sense to point to a clump of trees and ask “Do you 
understand what this clump of trees says?” In normal circum- 
stances, no; but couldn’t one express a sense by an arrangement of 
trees ? Couldn’t it be a code? 


One would call ‘propositions’ clumps of trees one under- 
stood; others, too, that one didn’t understand, provided one 
supposed the man who planted them had understood them. 


“Doesn’t understanding only start with a proposition, with a 
whole!proposition? Can you understand half a proposition?” — 
Half a proposition is not a whole proposition. - But what the 
question means can perhaps be understood as follows. Suppose a 
knight’s move in chess was always carried out by two movements 
of the piece, one straight and one oblique; then it could be said 
“In chess there are no half knight’s moves”’ meaning: the relation- 
ship of half a knight’s move to a whole knight’s move is not the 
same as that of half a bread roll to a whole bread roll. We want to 
say that it is not a difference of degree. 

It is strange that science and mathematics make use of propo- 
sitions, but have nothing to say about understanding those propo- 
sitions. 


2 We regard understanding as the essential thing, and signs as 
something inessential. - But in that case, why have the signs at 
all? If you think that it is only so as to make ourselves understood 
by others, then you are very likely looking on the signs as a drug 
which is to produce in other people the same condition as my own. 


39 


Suppose that the question is “what do you mean by that ges- 
ture >”? and the answer is “I mean you must leave”. The answer 
would not have been more correctly phrased: “I mean what I 


> >> 


mean by the sentence ‘you must leave’. 


In attacking the formalist conception of arithmetic, Frege says 
more or less this: these petty explanations of the signs are idle 
once we understand the signs. Understanding would be something 
like seeing a picture from which all the rules followed, or a picture 
that makes them all clear. But Frege does not seem to see that sucha 
picture would itself be another sign, or a calculus to explain the 
written one to us. 


What we call “understanding a language” is often like the 
understanding we get of a calculus when we learn its history or its 
practical application. And there too we meet an easily surveyable 
symbolism instead of one that is strange to us. - Imagine that 
someone had originally learnt chess as a writing game, and was 
later shown the ‘interpretation’ of chess as a board game. 

In this case “‘to understand” means something like “to take in 
as a whole’. 


If I give anyone an order I feel it to be quite enough to give him 
signs. And if I am given an order, I should never say: “this is only 
words, and I have got to get behind the words”. And when I have 
asked someone something and he gives me an answer I am con- 
tent — that was just what I expected ~ and I don’t raise the objec- 
tion: “but that’s a mere answer.” 


But if you say: “How am I to know what he means, when I see 
nothing but the signs he gives?” then I say: “How is 4e to know 
what he means, when he has nothing but the signs either?” 

What is spoken can only be explained in language, and so in this 
sense language itself cannot be explained. 


Language must speak for itself. 


40 


3 One can say that meaning drops out of language; because what a 
proposition means is told by yet another proposition. 


“What did you mean by those words?” “Did you mean those 
words.” The first question is not a more precise specification of the 
second. The first is answered by a proposition replacing the 
proposition which wasn’t understood. The second question is 
like: “Did you mean that seriously or as a joke?” 

Compare: “Did you mean anything by that gesture —if so 
what ?” 


In certain of their applications the words “understand”, “mean” 
refer to a psychological reaction while hearing, reading, uttering 
etc. a sentence. In that case understanding is the phenomenon that 
occurs when I hear a sentence in a familiar language and not when 
I hear a sentence in a strange language. 

Learning a language brings about the understanding of it. But 
that belongs to the past history of the reaction. - The under- 
standing of a sentence is as much something that happens to me as 
is the hearing of a sentence; it accompanies the hearing. 


I can speak of ‘experiencing’ a sentence. “I am not merely 
saying this, I mean something by it.”” When we consider what is 
going on in us when we mean (and don’t just say) words, it seems to 
us as if there were something coupled to the words, which other- 
wise would run idle. As if they connected with something in us. 


4 Understanding a sentence is more akin to understanding a piece 
of music than one might think. Why must these bars be played 
Just so? Why do I want to produce just this pattern of variation in 
loudness and tempo? I would like to say “Because I know what 
it’s all about.” But what is it all about ? I should not be able to say. 
For explanation I can only translate the musical picture into a 


picture in another medium and let the one picture throw light on the 
other, 


4I 


The understanding of a sentence can also be compared with 
what we call understanding a picture. Think of a still-life picture, 
and imagine that we were unable to see it as a spatial representation 
and saw only patches and lines on the canvas. We could say in that 
case “we do not understand the picture”. But we say the same thing 
in a different sense when although we see the picture spatially we 
do not recognize the spatial objects as familiar things like books, 
animals and bottles. 

Suppose the picture is a genre-picture and the people in it are 
about an inch long. If I had ever seen real people of that size, I 
would be able to recognize them in the picture and regard it as a 
life-size representation of them. In that case my visual experience 
of the picture would zor be the same as the one I have when I see the 
picture in the normal way as a representation in miniature, although 
the illusion of spatial vision is the same in each case. - However, 
acquaintance with real inch-high people is put forward here only 
as one possible cause of the visual experience; except for that the 
experience is independent. Similarly, it may be that only someone 
who has already seen many real cubes can see a drawn cube 
spatially; but the description of the spatial visual presentation 
contains nothing to differentiate a real cube from a painted one. 

The different experiences I have when IJ see a picture first one 
way and then another are comparable to the experience I have 
when I read a sentence with understanding and without under- 
standing. 

(Recall what it is like when someone reads a sentence with a 
mistaken intonation which prevents him from understanding it — 
and then realizes how it is to be read.) 


(To see a watch as a watch, i.e. as a dial with hands, is like seeing 
Orion as a man striding across the sky.) 


5 How curious: we should like to explain the understanding of a 
gesture as a translation into words, and the understanding of 
words as a translation into gestures. 

And indeed we really do explain words by a gesture, and a 
gesture by words. 


42 


On the other hand we say “I understand that gesture” in the 
same sense as “I understand this theme”’, “‘it says something” and 
what that means is that I have a particular experience as I follow it. 


Consider the difference it makes to the understanding of a 
sentence when a word in it is felt as belonging first with one word 
and then with another. I might have said: the word is conceived, 
understood, seen, pronounced as belonging first with one word 
and then with another. 


We can call a ‘proposition’ that which is conceived first in one 
way and then in another; we can also mean the various ways of 
conceiving it. This is a source of confusions. 


I read a sentence from the middle of a story: “After he had said 
this, he left her as he did the day before.’’ Do I understand the 
sentence? — It’s not altogether easy to give an answer. It is an 
English sentence, and to that extent I understand it. I should know 
how the sentence might be used, I could invent a context for it. 
And yet I do not understand it in the sense in which I should under- 
stand it if I had read the story. (Compare various language-games: 
describing a state of affairs, making up a story, etc. What counts as 
a significant sentence in the several cases ?) 


Do we understand Christian Morgenstern’s poems, or Lewis 
Carroll’s poem “Jabberwocky” ? In these cases it’s very clear that 
the concept of understanding is a fluid one. 


6 A sentence is given me in unfamiliar code together with the key 
for deciphering it. Then, in a certain sense, everything required 
for the understanding of the sentence has been given me. And yet 
if I were asked whether I understood the sentence J should reply 
“I must first decode it’’ and only when I had it in front of me 
decoded as an English sentence, would I say “now I understand 
16%: 

If we now raise the question “At what moment of translating into 
English does understanding begin?” we get a glimpse into the 


43 


nature of what is called “‘understanding”’’. 


I say the sentence “I see a black patch there’’; but the words are 
after all arbitrary: so I will replace them one after the other by the 
first six letters of the alphabet. Now it goes “a b cde f”’. But now 
it is clear that ~ as one would like to say — I cannot think the sense 
of the above sentence straight away in the new expression. I 
might also put it like this: I am not used to saying “a” instead of 
“7”, “b” instead of “‘see’’, “‘c”’ instead of ‘‘a” and so on. I don’t 
mean that I am not used to making an immediate association

between the word “I” and the sign “a”; but that I am not used 


e992 


to using “a” in the place of “1”. 


“To understand a sentence” can mean “to know what the 
sentence signifies”; i.e. to be able to answer the question ‘“‘what 
does this sentence say ?”’ 


It is a prevalent notion that we can only imperfectly exhibit our 
understanding; that we can only point to it from afar or come 
close to it, but never lay our hands on it, and that the ultimate 
thing can never be said. We say: “Understanding is something 
different from the expression of understanding. Understanding 
cannot be exhibited; it is something inward and spiritual.” - Or 
“Whatever I do to exhibit understanding, whether I repeat an 
explanation of a word, or carry out an order to show that I have 
understood it, these bits of behaviour do not have to be taken as 
proofs of understanding.” Similarly, people also say “I cannot 
show anyone else my toothache; I cannot prove to anyone else that 
I have toothache.” But the impossibility spoken of here is supposed 
to be a logical one. “Isn’t it the case that the expression of under- 
standing is always an incomplete expression?’ That means, I 
suppose, an expression with something missing — but the some- 
thing missing is essentially inexpressible, because otherwise I 


44 


might find a better expression for it. And “essentially inexpressible”’ 
means that it makes no sense to talk of a more complete expression. 


The psychological processes which are found by experience to 
accompany sentences are of no interest to us. What does interest 
us is the understanding that is embodied in an explanation of the 
sense of the sentence. 


7 Tounderstand the grammar of the word “to mean” we must ask 
ourselves what is the criterion for an expression’s being meant 
thus. What should be regarded as a criterion of the meaning ? 


An answer to the question “How is that meant?” exhibits the 
relationship between two linguistic expressions. So the question 
too is a question about that relationship. 


The process we call the understanding of a sentence or of a 
description is sometimes a process of translation from one symbo- 
lism into another; tracing a picture, copying something, or 
translating into another mode of representation. 

In that case understanding a description means making oneself 
a picture of what is described. And the process is more or less like 
making a drawing to match a description. 


We also say: “I understand the picture exactly, I could model 
it in clay”. 


8 We speak of the understanding of a sentence as a condition of 
being able to apply it. We say “I cannot obey an order if I do not 
understand it” or “I cannot obey it before I understand it’’. 

“Must I really understand a sentence to be able to act on it? — 
Certainly, otherwise you wouldn’t know what you had to do.” - 
But how does this knowing help me? Isn’t there in turn a jump 
from knowing to doing ? 

“But all the same I must understand an order to be able to act 
according to it” — here the “must” is fishy. If it is a logical must, 
then the sentence is a grammatical remark. 


45 


Here it could be asked: How long before obeying it must you 
understand the order? ~ But of course the proposition “I must 
understand the order before I can act on it” makes good sense: 
but not a metalogical sense. - And ‘understanding’ and ‘mean- 
ing’ are not metalogical concepts. 


If “to understand a sentence” means somehow or other to act 
on it, then understanding cannot be a precondition for our acting 
on it. But of course experience may show that the specific be- 
haviour of understanding is a precondition for obedience to an 
order. 


“T cannot carry out the order because I don’t understand what 
you mean. — Yes, I understand you now.” — What went on when I 
suddenly understood him? Here thete ate many possibilities. For 
example: the order may have been given in a familiar language 
but with a wrong emphasis, and the right emphasis suddenly 
occurred to me. In that case perhaps I should say to a third party: 
“Now I understand him: he means...” and should repeat the 
order with the right emphasis. And when I grasped the familiar 
sentence I’d have understood the order, — I mean, I should not 
first have had to grasp an abstract sense. — Alternatively: I under- 
stood the order in shat sense, so it was a correct English sentence, 
but it seemed preposterous. In such a case I would say: “I do not 
understand you: because you can’t mean ¢haz.”” But then a more 
comprehensible interpretation occurred to me. Before I under- 
stand several interpretations, several explanations, may pass 
through my mind, and then I decide on one of them. 

(Understanding, when an absent-minded man at the order 
“Right turn!” turns left, and then, clutching his forehead, says 
“Oh! right turn” and does a right turn.) 


9 Suppose the order to square a series of numbers is written in the 
form of a table, thus: 


46 


x? 


— It seems to us as if by understanding the order we add some- 
thing to it, something that fills the gap between command and 
execution. So that if someone said “You understand it, don’t you, 
so it is not incomplete” we could reply “Yes, I understand it, but 
only because I add something to it, namely the interpretation.” 
~ But what makes you give just this interpretation ? Is it the order ? 
In that case it was already unambiguous, since it demanded this 
interpretation. Or did you attach the interpretation arbitrarily ? 
In that case what you understood was not the command, but only 
what you made of it. 


(While thinking philosophically we see problems in places where 
there are none. It is for philosophy to show that there are no 
problems.) 


But an interpretation is something that is given in signs. It is 
this interpretation as opposed to a different one (running differ- 
ently). So if one were to say “Any sentence still stands in need of an 
interpretation” that would mean: no sentence can be understood 
without a rider. 


Of course sometimes I do interpret signs, give signs an inter- 
pretation ; but that does not happen every time I understand a sign. 
(If someone asks me “What time is it” there is no inner process 
of laborious interpretation; I simply react to what I see and hear. 
If someone whips out a knife at me, I do not say “I interpret that 
as a threat”’.) 


to “Understanding a word” may mean: knowing how it is used; 
being able to apply it. 


“Can you lift this ball?” - “Yes”. Then I try and fail. Then 
perhaps I say “I was wrong, 1 cannot”. Or perhaps “I can’t now, 
because I am too tired; but when I said I could, I really could.” 


Similarly “I thought I could play chess, but now I have forgotten 


47 


how”, but on the other hand ‘When I said ‘I can play chess’ I 
really could, but now I’ve lost it.””- But what is the criterion for 
my being able at that particular time? How did I know that I 
could ? To that question I would answer “I’ve always been able to 
lift that sort of weight’, “I lifted it just a moment before’’, “T’ve 
played chess quite recently and my memory is good”, “Td just 
recited the rules” and so on. What I regard as an answer to that 
question will show me in what way J use the word “‘can’’. 


Knowing, being able to do something, a capacity is what we 
would call a s/afe. Let us compare with each other propositions 
which all in various senses describe states. 

“T have had toothache since yesterday.” 

“T have been longing for him since yesterday.” 

“T have been expecting him since yesterday.” 

“T have known since yesterday that he is coming.” 

“Since yesterday I can play chess.” 

Can one say: “I have known continuously since yesterday that 
he is coming 2” In which of the above sentences can one sensibly 
insert the word “continuously” ? 


If knowledge is called a “‘state” it must be in the sense in which 
we speak of the state of a body or of a physical model. So it must 
be in a physiological sense or in the sense used ina psychology that 
talks about unconscious states of a mind-model. Certainly no one 
would object to that; but in that case one still has to be clear that 
we have moved from the grammatical realm of ‘conscious 
states’ into a different grammatical realm. I can no doubt speak. of 
unconscious toothache, if the sentence “I have unconscious 
toothache” means something like “I have a bad tooth that doesn’t 
ache”. But the expression “conscious state” (in its old sense) 
doesn’t have the same grammatical relationship to the expression 


48 


““anconscious state” as the expression “‘a chair which I see”’ has to 
“a chair which I don’t see because it’s behind me”’. 


Instead of “to know something” we might say “to keep a piece 
of paper on which it is written”’. 


If “to understand the meaning of a word” means to know the 
grammatically possible ways of applying it, then I can ask “How 
can I know what I mean by a word at the moment I utter it ? After 
all, I can’t have the whole mode of application of a word in my 
head all at once”’. 


I can have the possible ways of applying a word in my head 
in the same sense as the chess player has all the rules of chess in his 
head, and the alphabet and the multiplication table. Knowledge is 
the hypothesized reservoir out of which the visible water flows. 


11 So we mustn’t think that when we understand or mean a word 
what happens is an act of instantaneous, as it were non-discursive, 
grasp of grammar. As if it could all be swallowed down in a single 


gulp. 


It is as if I get tools in the toolbox of language ready for future 
use. 


“T can use the word ‘yellow’ ”’ is like “I know how to move the 
king in chess’. 


In this example of chess we can again observe the ambiguity of 
the word “understand”. When a man who knows the game 
watches a game of chess, the experience he has when a move is 
made usually differs from that of someone else watching without 
understanding the game. (It differs too from that of a man who 
doesn’t even know that it’s a game.) We can also say that it’s the 
knowledge of the rules of chess which makes the difference be- 
tween the two spectators, and so too that it’s the knowledge of the 


rules which makes the first spectator have the particular experience 
he has. But this experience is not the knowledge of the rules. Yet 
we ate inclined to call them both “understanding”’. 


The understanding of language, as of a game, seems like a 
background against which a particular sentence acquires meaning. 
~ But this understanding, the knowledge of the language, isn’t a 
conscious state that accompanies the sentences of the language. 
Not even if one of its consequences is such a state. It’s much more 
like the understanding or mastery of a calculus, something like the 
ability to multiply. 


12 Suppose it were asked: “When do you know how to play 
chess? All the time? Or just while you say that you can? Or just 
during a move in the game?” — How queer that knowing how to 
play chess should take such a short time, and a game of chess so 
much longer! 

(Augustine: “When do I measure a period of time?”’) 


It can seem as if the rules of grammar are in a certain sense an 
unpacking of something we experience all at once when we use a 
word. 


In order to get clearer about the grammar of the word “under- 
stand”’, let’s ask: when do we understand a sentence ? - When we’ve 
uttered the whole of it? Or while uttering it P - Is understanding, 
like the uttering of a sentence, an articulated process and does its 
articulation correspond exactly to that of the sentence? Or is it 
non-atticulate, something accompanying the sentence in the way a 
pedal note accompanies a melody ? 


How long does it take to understand a sentence ? 
And if we understand a sentence for a whole hour, are we always 


starting afresh ? 


13 Chess is characterized by its rules (by the list of rules). If I 
define the game (distinguish it from draughts) by its rules, then 


59 


these rules belong to the grammar of the word “chess”. Does that 
mean that if someone uses the word “chess” intelligently he must 
have a definition of the word in mind? Certainly not. — He will 
only give one if he’s asked what he means by “‘chess”’. 

Suppose I now ask: “When you uttered the word, what did you 
mean by it?” — If he answered “‘I meant the game we’ve played so 
often, etc. etc.”” I would know that this explanation hadn’t been in 
his mind at all when he used the word, and that he wasn’t giving an 
answer to my question in the sense of telling me what “‘went on 
inside him’’ while he was uttering the word, 


When someone interprets, or understands, a sign in one sense 
or another, what he is doing is taking a step in a calculus (like a 
calculation). What he does is roughly what he does if he gives 
expression to his interpretation. 


“Thought’’ sometimes means a particular mental process which 
may accompany the utterance of a sentence and sometimes the 
sentence itself in the system of language. 


“He said those words, but he didn’t think any thoughts with 
them.” - “Yes, I did think a thought while I said them”. “What 
thought ?” “Just what I said.” 


On hearing the assertion “This sentence makes sense” you 
cannot really ask “‘what sense?” Just as on hearing the assertion 
“this combination of words is a sentence” you cannot ask “‘what 
sentence ?” 


Il 


14 Can what the rules of grammar say about a word be described 
in another way by describing the process which takes place when 
understanding occurs ? 

Suppose the grammar is the geometry of negation for example, 
can I replace it by the description of what “lies behind” the word 
“not” when it is applied ? 

We say: “Anyone who understands negation knows that two 
negations yield an affirmation.” 


That sounds like “Carbon and oxygen yield carbonic acid”. 
But in reality a doubled negation does not yre/d anything, it és 
something. 

Something here gives us the illusion of a fact of physics. As if 
we saw the result of a logical process. Whereas the only result is the 
result of the physical process. 


We would like to say: ‘Negation has the property that when it is 
doubled it yields an affirmation,” But the rule doesn’t give a 
further description of negation, it constitutes negation. 

Negation has the property that it denies truly such and such a 
sentence. 

Similarly, a circle — say one painted on a flat surface — has the 
ptoperty of being in such and such a position, of having the colour 
it has, of being bisected by a certain line (a boundary between two 
colours) and so on; but it doesn’t have the properties that geometry 
seems to ascribe to it (i.e. the abi/ity to have the other properties). 

Likewise one doesn’t have the property that when it’s added to 
itself it makes two. 


15 Geometry no more speaks about cubes than logic does about 
negation. 

Geometry defines the form of a cube but does not describe it. 
If the description of a cube says that it is red and hard, then ‘a 


§2 


description of the form of a cube’ is a sentence like ‘““This box has 
the form of a cube”’. 


But if I describe how to make a cubical box, doesn’t this contain 
a description of the form of a cube? A description only insofar as 
this thing is said to be cubical, and for the rest an analysis of the 
concept of cube. 


“This paper is zo¢ black, and two such negations yield an affirma- 
tion”’. 

The second clause is reminiscent of “and two such horses can 
pull the cart’’. But it contains no assertion about negation; it is 
a tule for the replacement of one sign by another. 


“That two negations yield an affirmation must already be 

contained in the negation that I am using now.” Here I am on the 
verge of inventing a mythology of symbolism. 
It looks as if one could infer from the meaning of negation that 
~~ p” means p. As if the rules for the negation sign follow from 
the nature of negation. So that in a certain sense there is first of all 
negation, and then the rules of grammar. 

It also looks as if the essence of negation had a double expression 
in language: the one whose meaning I grasp when I understand 
the expression of negation in a sentence, and the consequences of 
this meaning in the grammar. 


“ee 


16 What does it mean to say that the “‘is” in ““The rose is red”’ has a 
different meaning from the “‘is’’ in “Twice two is four’’? If it is 
answered that it means that different rules are valid for these two 
words, we can say that we have only ove word here. — And if all 1 
am attending to is grammatical rules, these do allow the use of the 
word “is” in both connections. — But the rule which shews that the 
word “‘is” has different meanings in the two sentences is the one 


53 


allowing us to replace the word “is” in the second sentence by 
“equals” and forbidding this substitution in the first sentence. 


“Is this rule then only the consequence of the firs¢ rule, that the 
word ‘is’ has different meanings in the two sentences? Or is it 
rather that this very rule is the expression of the word’s having a 
different meaning in the two contexts?” 


It looks as if a sentence with e.g. the word “ball” in it already 
contained the shadow of other uses of this word. That is to say, the 
possibility of forming those other sentences. To whom does it look 
like that ? And under what circumstances ? 


The comparison suggests itself that the word “is” in different 
cases has different eaning-bodies behind it; that it is perhaps each 
time a square surface, but in one case it is the end surface of a 
prism and in the other the end surface of a pyramid. 

Imagine the following case. Suppose we have some completely 
transparent glass cubes which have one face painted red. If we 
arrange these cubes together in space, only certain arrangements of 
red squares will be permitted by the shape of the glass bodies. I 
might then express the rule for the possible arrangements of the red 
squares without mentioning the cubes; but the rule would none 
the less contain the essence of the form of cube — Not, of course, 
the fact that there are glass cubes behind the red squares, but the 
geometry of the cube. 

But suppose we see such a cube: are we immediately presented 
with the rules for the possible combinations, i.e. the geometry of 
the cube ? Can I read off the geometry of the cube from a cube? 


Thus the cube is a notation for the rule. And if we had discovered 
such a rule, we really wouldn’t be able to find anything better than 
the drawing of a cube to use as a notation for it. (And it is sig- 
nificant that here a drawing of a cube will do instead of a cube.) 


54 


But how can the cube (or the drawing) serve as a notation for a 
geometrical rule? Only if it belongs, as a proposition or part of a 
proposition, to a system of propositions. 


17 “Of course the grammatical possibilities of the negation sign 
reveal themselves bit by bit in the use of the signs, but I shink 
negation all at once. The sign ‘not’ is only a pointer to the thought 
‘not’; it is only a stimulus to produce the right thought, only a 
signal.” 


(If I were asked what I mean by the word ‘“‘and” in the sentence 
“pass me the bread and butter” I would answer by a gesture of 
gathering together; and that gesture would illustrate what I mean, 
in the same way as a green pattern illustrates the meaning of 


“green” and the T-F notation illustrates the meaning of “not”, 
“and” etc.) 


p ”> 


For instance, this sign for negation: T is worth no 
E 


Fp 
Ww 
mote and no less than any other negation sign; it is a complex of 
lines just like the expression “not-p” and it is only made into a sign 
for negation by the way it works — 1 mean, the way it is used in the 
game. 

(The same goes for the T-F schemata for tautology and contra- 
diction.) 


What I want to say is that to be a sign a thing must be dynamic, 
not static. 


18 Here it can easily seem as if the sign contained the whole of the 
grammar; as if the grammar were contained in the sign like a 
string of pearls in a box and he had only to pull it out. (But this 
kind of picture is just what is misleading us). As if understanding 
were an instantaneous grasping of something from which later we 
only draw consequences which already exist in an ideal sense before 
they are drawn. As if the cube already contained the geometry of 
the cube, and I had only to unpack it. But which cube? Or is there 


53 


an ideal geometrical cube ? — Often we have in mind the process of 
deriving geometrical propositions froma drawing, a representation 
(or a model). But what is the role of the model in such a case? It 
has the role of a sign, a sign employed in a particular game. ~ And 
it is an interesting and remarkable thing how this sign is employed, 
how we perhaps use the drawing of a cube again and again in 
different contexts. — And it is this sign, (which has the identity proper 
to a sign) that we take to be the cube in which the geometrical laws 
are already laid up. (They are no more laid up there than the 
disposition to be used in a certain way is laid up in the chessman 
which is the king). 


In philosophy one is constantly tempted to invent a mythology 
of symbolism or of psychology, instead of simply saying what we 
know. 


19 The concept of meaning I adopted in my philosophical dis- 
cussions originates in a primitive philosophy of language. 


The German word for “meaning” is derived from the German 
word for “pointing”’. 


When Augustine talks about the learning of language he talks 
about how we attach names to things, or understand the names of 
things. Naming here appears as the foundation, the be all and end 
all of language. 

Augustine does not speak of there being any difference between 
parts of speech and means by “‘names”’ apparently words like 
“tree”, “table”, “bread” and of course, the proper names of 
people; also no doubt “eat”, “go”, “here”, “‘there’’ ~ all words, 
in fact. Certainly he’s thinking first and foremost of nouns, and of 
the remaining words as something that will take care of itself. 
(Plato too says that a sentence consists of nouns and verbs.)! 


1. Sophist, 261E, 262A. [I have replaced “kinds of word” which appears 
in the translation of the parallel passages in Philosophical Investigations 
§1 with “parts of speech”, which appears to have been Wittgenstein’s 
preferred translation. I am indebted for this information to Mr. R. Rhees. 
Trs.] 


56 


They describe the game as simpler than it is. 

But the game Augustine describes is certainly a part of language. 
Imagine I want to put up a building using building stones someone 
else is to pass me; we might first make a convention by my pointing 
to a building stone and saying “‘that is a pillar’, and to another and 
saying “that is called ‘a block’ ”’, ‘that is called ‘a slab’ ”’ and so on. 
And then I call out the words “pillar”, “slab”, etc. in the order in 
which I need the stones. 


Augustine does describe a calculus of our language, only not 
everything that we call language is this calculus. (And one has to 
say this in many cases where we are faced with the question “Is this 
an appropriate description or not?” The answer is: “Yes, it is 
appropriate, but only Jere, and not for the whole region that you 
were claiming to describe.”) So it could be said that Augustine 
represents the matter too simply; but also that he represents 
something simpler. 

It is as if someone were to say “‘a game consists in moving ob- 
jects about on a surface according to certain rules...” and we 
replied: You must be thinking of board games, and your descrip- 
tion is indeed applicable to them. But they are not the only games. 
So you can make your definitions correct by expressly restricting 
it to those games. 


20 The way Augustine describes the learning of language can 
show us the way of looking at language from which the concept 
of the meaning of words derives. 

The case of our language could be compared with a script in 
which the letters were used to stand for sounds, and also as signs 
of emphasis and perhaps as marks of punctuation. If one conceives 
this script as a language for describing sound-patterns, one can 
imagine someone misinterpreting the script as if there were 
simply a correspondence of letters to sounds and as if the letters 
had not also completely different functions. 


57 


Just as the handles in the cabin of a locomotive have different 
kinds of job, so do the words of language, which in one way are 
like handles. One is the handle of a crank, it can be moved con- 
tinuously since it operates a valve; another works a switch, 
which has two positions; a third is the handle of a pump and only 
works when it is being moved up and down etc. But they all look 
alike, since they are all worked by hand. 


A connected point: it is possible to speak perfectly intelligibly 
of combinations of colours and shapes (e.g. of the colours red and 
blue and the shapes square and circle) just as we speak of combina- 
tions of different shapes or spatial objects. And this is the origin 
of the bad expression: a fact is a complex of objects. Here the 
fact that a man is sick is compared with a combination of two things, 
one of them the man and the other the sickness. 


21 A man who reads a sentence in a familiar language experiences 
the different parts of speech in quite different ways. (Think of the 
comparison with meaning-bodies.) We quite forget that the 
written and spoken words “not”, “table” and “green” are similar 
to each other. It is only in a foreign language that we see clearly the 
uniformity of words. (Compare William James on the feelings that 
correspond to words like “not”, “but” and so on.) 


(“Not” makes a gesture of rejection. 
No, it és a gesture of rejection. To grasp negation is to under- 
stand a gesture of rejection.) 


Compare the different parts of speech in a sentence with lines 
on a map with different functions (frontiers, roads, meridians, 
contours.) An uninstructed person sees a mass of lines and does 
not know the variety of their meanings. 


58 


Think of a line on a map crossing a sign out to show that it is 
void 


The difference between parts of speech is comparable to the 
differences between chessmen, but also to the even greater differ- 
ence between a chessman and the chess board. 


22 We say: the essential thing in a word is its meaning. We can 
replace the word by another with the same meaning. That fixes 
a place for the word, and we can substitute one word for another 
provided we put it in the same place. 


If I decide to say a new word instead of “‘red”’ (perhaps only in 
thought), how would it come out that it took the place of the 
word “‘red”’? 

Suppose it was agreed to say “non” in English instead of “not”, 
and “not” instead of “red”’. In that case the word “not” would 
remain in the language, and one could say that “non” was now used 
in the way in which “not” used to be, and that ‘“‘not” now had a 
different use. 


Would it not be similar if I decided to alter the shape of the chess 
pieces, or to use a knight-shaped piece as the king ? How would it 


be clear that the knight is the king ? In this case can’t I very well talk 
about a change of meaning ? 


23 I want to say the place of a word in grammar is its meaning. 


But I might also say: the meaning of a word is what the explana- 
tion of its meaning explains. 


“What 1 c.c. of water weighs is called ‘1 gram’ — Well, what 
does it weigh?” 


The explanation of the meaning explains the use of the word. 


59 


The use of a word in the language is its meaning. 


Grammar describes the use of words in the language. 
So it has somewhat the same relation to the language as the 
description of a game, the rules of a game, have to the game. 


Meaning, in our sense, is embodied in the explanation of mean- 
ing. If, on the other hand, by the word “meaning” we mean a 
characteristic sensation connected with the use of a word, then the 
relation between the explanation of a word and its meaning is 
rather that of cause to effect. 


24 An explanation of meaning can remove every disagreement 
with regard to a meaning. It can clear up misunderstandings. 

The understanding here spoken of is a correlate of explanation. 

By “explanation of the meaning of a sign” we mean rules for use 
but above all definitions. The distinction between verbal defini- 
tions and ostensive definitions gives a rough division of these 
types of explanation. 

In order to understand the role of a definition in the calculus we 
must investigate the particular case. 


It may seem to us as if the other grammatical rules for a word had 
to follow from its ostensive definition; since after all an ostensive 
definition, e.g. “that is called ‘red’”” determines the meaning of 
the word “red”, 

But this definition is only those words plus pointing to a red 
object, e.g. a red piece of paper. And is this definition really un- 
ambiguous? Couldn’t I have used the very same one to give the 
word “red” the meaning of the word “paper”, or “square”, or 
“shiny”, or “light”, or “thin” etc. etc.? 


However, suppose that instead of saying “that is called ‘red’ ” 


60 


I had phrased my definition “that colour is called ‘red’. That 
certainly is unambiguous, but only because the expression “colour” 
settles the grammar of the word “red” up to this last point. (But 
here questions could arise like “do you call just ¢4és shade of 
colour red, or also other similar shades ?’’). Definitions might be 
given like this: the colour of this patch is called “red”, its shape 
“ellipse”. 


I might say: one must already understand a great deal of a 
language in order to understand that definition. Someone who 
understands that definition must already know where the words 
(“red”, “ellipse”) are being put, where they belong in language. 


25 The words “shape” and “‘colour” in the definitions determine 
the kind of use of the word, and therefore what one may call the 
part of speech. And in ordinary grammar one might well distin- 
guish “shape words”, “colour words’, “sound words”, “sub- 
stance words” and so on as different parts of speech. (There 
wouldn’t be the same reason for distinguishing “metal words’’, 
“poison words”, “predator words”’. It makes sense to say “iron is 
a metal”, “phosphorus is a poison”, etc. but not “red is a colour’, 
“a circle is a shape” and so on.) 


I can ostensively define a word for a colour or a shape or a 
number, etc. etc. (children are given ostensive explanations of 
numerals and they do perfectly well); negation, too, disjunction 
and so on. The same ostension might define a numeral, or the name 
of a shape or the name of a colour. But in the grammar of each 
different part of speech the ostensive definition has a different role; 
and in each case it is only one rule. 


(Consider also the grammar of definitions like: “today is called 


93 ¢¢ 


Monday”, “I will call this day of the year ‘the day of atonement’ ”’). 


26 But when we learn the meaning of a word, we are very often 
given only the single rule, the ostensive definition. So how does it 


61 


Ne ee ee 


come about that on the strength of this definition we understand 
the word? Do we guess the rest of the rules ? 

Think also of teaching a child to understand words by showing 
it objects and uttering words. The child is given ostensive defi- 


nitions and then it understands the words. — But what is the cri- 


terion of understanding here? Surely, that the child applies the 
words correctly. Does it guess rules? — Indeed we must ask our- 
selves whether we are to call these signs and utterances of words 
“definitions” at all. The language game is still very simple and the 
ostensive definition has not the same role in this language-game 
as in more developed ones. (For instance, the child cannot yet ask 
“What is that called >”’) But there is no sharp boundary between 
primitive forms and more complicated ones. I wouldn’t know what 
I can and what I can’t still call “definition”. I can only describe 
language games or calculi; whether we still want to call them 
calculi or not doesn’t matter as long as we don’t let the use of the 
general term divert us from examining each particular case we wish 
to decide. 


I might also say of a little child “he can use the word, he knows 
how it is applied.” But I only see what that means if I ask “what is 
the criterion for this knowledge >” In this case it isn’t the ability 
to state rules. 


What’s the sign of someone’s understanding a game? Must he 
be able to recite the rules? Isn’t it also a criterion that he can play 
the game, i.e. that he does in fact play it, even if he’s baffled when 
asked for the rules? Is it only by being told the rules that the game 
is learnt and not also simply by watching it being played? Of 
course a man will often say to himself while watching “oh, so 
that’s the rule”; and he might perhaps write down the rules as he 
observes them; but there’s certainly such a thing as learning the 
game without explicit rules. 


The grammar of a language isn’t recorded and doesn’t come into 
existence until the language has already been spoken by human 


62 


beings for a /ong time. Similarly, primitive games are played with- 
out their rules being codified, and even without a single rule 
being formulated. 


But we look at games and language under the guise of a game 
played according to rules. That is, we are always comparing language 
with a procedure of that kind. 


27 The names I give to bodies, shapes, colours, lengths have 
different grammars in each case. (“A” in “A is yellow” has one 
grammar if A is a body and another if A is the surface of a body; 
for instance it makes sense to say that the body is yellow all through, 
but not to say that the surface is.) And one points in different sense 
to a body, and to its length or its colour; for example, a possible 
definition would be: “to point to a colour” means, to point to the 
body which has the colour. Just as a man who marries money 
doesn’t marry it in the same sense as he marries the woman who 
owns the money. 


Money, and what one buys with it. Sometimes a material object, 
sometimes the right to a seat in the theatre, or a title, or fast travel, 
ot life, etc. 


A name has meaning, a proposition has sense in the calculus to 
which it belongs. The calculus is as it were autonomous. — Lan- 
guage must speak for itself. 

I might say: the only thing that is of interest to me is the content 
of a proposition and the content of a proposition is something 
internal to it. A proposition has its content as part of a calculus. 


The meaning is the role of the word in the calculus. 


The meaning of a name is not the thing we point to when we give 
an ostensive definition of the name; that is, it is not the bearer of 


the name. — The expression “the bearer of the name ‘N’” is 
synonymous with the name “N”. The expression can be used in 
place of the name. “The bearer of the name ‘N’ is sick’? means 
“N is sick”. We don’t say: The meaning of ““N” is sick. 

The name doesn’t lose its meaning if its bearer ceases to exist 
(if he dies, say). 

But doesn’t ““T'wo names have a single bearer”’ mean the same 
as “two names have the same meaning?” Certainly, instead of 
“A = B” one can write “the bearer of the name ‘A’ = the bearer 
of the name ‘B’”’. 


28 What does “to understand a word” mean ? 

We say to a child “No, no more sugar” and take it away from 
him. Thus he learns the meaning of the word “‘no’’. If, while saying 
the same words, we had given him a piece of sugar he would have 
learnt to understand the word differently. (In this way he has learnt 
to use the word, but also to associate a particular feeling with it, 
to experience it in a particular way.) 


What constitutes the meaning of a word like “perhaps” ? How 
does a child learn the use of the word “perhaps” ? It may repeat a 
sentence it has heard from an adult like “perhaps she will come”; 
it may do so in the same tone of voice as the adult. (That is a kind 
of a game). In such a case the question is sometimes asked: Does 
it already understand the word “perhaps”’ or is it only repeating 
it ? — What shows that it really understands the word ? — Well, that 
it uses it in particular circumstances in a particular manner — in 
certain contexts and with a particular intonation. 

What does it mean “to understand the word ‘perhaps’ ” ? - Do 
I understand the word “‘perhaps” ? — And how do I judge whether 
Ido? Well, something like this: I know how it’s used, I can explain 
its use to somebody, say by describing it in made-up cases. I can 
describe the occasions of its use, its position in sentences, the 
intonation it has in speech. — Of course this only means that “I 


64 


abies eg 


understand the word ‘perhaps’”’ comes to the same as: “I know how 
it is used etc.”’; not that I try to call to mind its entire application in 
order to answer the question whether I understand the word. 
More likely I would react to this question immediately with the 
answer “yes”, perhaps after having said the word to myself once 
again, and as it were convinced myself that it’s familiar, or else I 
might think of a single application and pronounce the word with 
the correct intonation and a gesture of uncertainty. And so on. 
This is like the case in which someone is explaining to me a 
calculation “that I don’t quite understand”, and when he has 
reached a particular point of his explanation, I say: ‘“‘ah, now I 
understand; now I know how to go on”. How do I know that I 
know how to go on? Have I run through the rest of the calculation 
at that moment? Of course not. Perhaps a bit of it flashed before 
my mind; perhaps a particular application or a diagram. If I were 
asked: how do you know that you can use the word “perhaps” I 
would perhaps simply answer “T have used it a hundred times”’. 


29 But it might be asked: Do I wnderstand the word just be des- 
cribing its application? Do I understand its point? Haven’t I 
deluded myself about something important ? 


At present, say, I know only how men use this word. But it 
might be a game, or a form of etiquette. I do not know why they 
behave in this way, how /anguage meshes with their life. 

Is meaning then really only the use of a word ? Isn’t it the way 
this use meshes with our life? 

But isn’t its use a part of our life? 


Do I understand the word “‘fine” when I know how and on what 
occasions people use it? Is that enough to enable me to use it 
myself? I mean, so to say, use it with conviction. 

Wouldn’t it be possible for me to know the use of the word and 
yet follow it without understanding ? (As, in a sense, we follow the 


65 


singing of birds). So isn’t it something else that constitutes under- 
standing — the feeling “in one’s own breast”, the living experience 
of the expressions ? — They must mesh with my own life. 


Well, language does connect up with my own life. And what is 
called “language” is something made up of heterogeneous ele- 
ments and the way it meshes with life is infinitely various. 


30 We may say that the words “fine”, “oh”, and also “perhaps” are 
expressions of sensation, of feeling. But I don’t call the feeling the 
meaning of the word. We are not interested in the relation of the 
words to the senesation, whatever it may be, whether they are 
evoked by it, or are regularly accompanied by it, or give it an 
outlet. We are not interested in any empirical facts about language, 
considered as empirical facts. We are only concerned with the 
description of what happens and it is not the truth but the form of 


the description that interests us. What happens considered as a 
game. 


Tam only describing language, not explaining anything. 


For my purposes I could replace the sensation the word is said 


to express by the intonation and gestures with which the word is 
used. 


T might say: in many cases understanding a word involves being 
able to use it on certain occasions in a special tone of voice. 


You might say that certain words are only pegs to hang intona- 
tions on. 


But instead of the intonation and the accompanying gestures, I 
might for my own purposes treat the word itself as a gesture. 
(Can’t I say that the sound “ha ha” is a laugh and the sound “oh!” 
is a sigh ?) 


66 


31 I could imagine a language that was spoken in a uniform 
metre, with quasi-words intercalated between the words of the 
sentences to maintain the metre. Suppose we talked about the mean- 
ing of these quasi-words. (The smith putting in extra taps between 
the real strokes in order to maintain a rhythm in striking). 


Language is like a collection of very various tools. In the tool 
box there is a hammer, a saw, a tule, a lead, a glue pot and glue. 
Many of the tools are akin to each other in form and use, and the 
tools can be roughly divided into groups according to their 
relationships; but the boundaries between these groups will often 
be more or less arbitrary and there are various types of relationship 
that cut across one another. 


I said that the meaning of a word is its role in the calculus of 
language. (I compared it to a piece in chess). Now let us think how 
we calculate with a word, for instance with the word “red”. We are 
told where the colour is situated; we are told the shape and size of 
the coloured patch or the coloured object; we are told whether 
the colour is pure or mixed, light or dark, whether it remains 
constant or changes, etc. etc. Conclusions are drawn from the 
propositions, they are translated into diagrams and into behaviour, 
there is drawing, measurement and calculation. But think of the 
meaning of the word “oh!” If we were asked about it, we would 
say “‘oh’! is a sigh; we say, for instance, things like ‘Oh, it is 
raining again already’”. And that would describe the use of the 
word. But what corresponds now to the calculus, the complicated 
game that we play with other words ? In the use of the words “oh!”, 
or “hurrah”, or ““hm’’, there is nothing comparable. 

Moreover, we mustn’t confuse signs with symptoms here. The 
sound “hm” may be called an expression of dubiousness and also, 
for other people, a symptom of dubiousness, in the way that 


clouds are a symptom of rain. But “hm” is not the zame of du- 
biousness. 


32 Suppose we want to describe bal/-games. There are some games 
like football, cricket and tennis, which have a well-developed and 
complicated system of rules; there is a game consisting simply of 
everyone’s throwing a ball as high as he can; and there is the game 
little children play of throwing a ball in any direction and then 
retrieving it. Or again someone throws a ball high into the air 
for the fun of it and catches it again without any element of com- 
petition. Perhaps one will be unwilling to call some of these ball 
games at all; but is it clear where the boundary is to be drawn here? 


We are interested in language as a procedure according to 
explicit rules, because philosophical problems are misunder- 
standings which must be removed by clarification of the rules 
according to which we are inclined to use words. 

We consider language from,one point of view only. 


We said that when we understood the use we didn’t yet under- 
stand the purpose of the word “perhaps’’. And by “purpose” in this 
case we meant the role in human life. (This role can be called the 
“meaning” of the word in the sense in which one speaks of the 
‘meaning of an event for our life’.) 

But we said that by “meaning” we meant what an explanation of 
meaning explains. And an explanation of meaning is not an empiri- 


cal proposition and not a causal explanation, but a rule, a conven- 
tion. 


It might be said that the purpose of the word “hey!”’ in our 
language is to alarm the person spoken to. But what does its having 
this purpose amount to? What is the criterion for it? The word 
“purpose” like all the words of our language is used in various 
more or less related ways. I will mention two characteristic games. 
We might say that the purpose of doing something is what the 
person doing it would say if asked what its purpose was. On the 


68 


other hand if we say that the hen clucks in order to. call her chicks 
together we infer this purpose from the effect of the clucking. We 
wouldn’t call the gathering of the chicks the purpose of the 
clucking if the clucking didn’t have this result always, or at least 
commonly or in specifiable circumstances. — One may now say 
that the purpose, the effect of the word “hey” is the important 
thing about the word; but explaining the purpose or the effect is 
not what we call explaining the meaning. 


It may be that if it is to achieve its effect a particular word 
cannot be replaced by any other; just as it may be that a gesture 
cannot be replaced by any other. (The word has a sou/ and not just 
a meaning.) No one would believe that a poem remained essen- 
tially unaltered if its words were replaced by others in accordance 
with an appropriate convention. 


Our proposition “meaning is what an explanation of apea nine 
explains” could also be interpreted in the following way: let’s only 
bother about what’s called the explanation of meaning, and let’s 
not bother about meaning in any other sense. 


33 But one might say something like this. The sentences that we 
utter have a particular purpose, they are to produce certain 
effects. They are parts of a mechanism, perhaps a psychological 
mechanism, and the words of the sentences are also parts of the 
mechanism (levers, cogwheels and so on). The example that seems 
to illustrate what we’re thinking of here is an automatic music 
player, a pianola. It contains a roll, rollers, etc., on which the piece 
of music is written in some kind of notation (the position of holes, 
pegs and so on). It’s as if these written signs gave ores which 
ate carried out by the keys and hammers. And so shoulda t we say 
that the sense of the sign is its effect ? - But suppose the pianola is in 
bad condition and the signs on the roll produce hisses and bangs 
instead of the notes. - Perhaps you will say that the sense of the 
signs is their effect on a mechanism in good condition, and corres- 


pondingly that the sense of an order is its effect on an obedient man. 
But what is regarded as a criterion of obedience here ? 

You might then say that the sense of the signs is not their effect, 
but their purpose. But consider too, that we’re tempted to think 
that this purpose is only a part of the larger purpose served by the 
pianola. - This purpose, say, is to entertain people. But it’s clear 
that when we spoke of “the sense of the signs” we didn’t mean any 
part of ¢hat purpose. We were thinking rather of the purpose of the 
signs within the mechanism of the pianola. - And so you can say 
that the purpose of an order is its sense, only so far as the purpose 
can be expressed by a rule of language. “I am saying ‘go away’ 
because I want you to leave me alone”, “I am saying ‘perhaps’ 
because I am not quite sure.” 


An explanation of the operation of language as a psychophysical 
mechanism is of no interest to us. Such an explanation itself uses 
language to describe phenomena (association, memory etc); it is 
itself a linguistic act and stands outside the calculus; but we need 
an explanation which is part of the calculus. 


“How is he to know what colour he is to pick out when he hears 
the word ‘red’? — Very simple: he is to take the colour whose 
image occurs to him when he hears the word” — But how will he 
know what that means, and which colour it is “which occurs to 
him when he hears the word” ? 

Certainly there is such a procedure as choosing the colour which 
occurs to you when you hear that word. And the sentence “red is 
the colour that occurs to you when you hear the word ‘ted’ ” is a 
definition. 


If I say, “a symbol is something which produces this effect” the 
question remains: how can I speak of “this effect”? And if it 
occurs, how do I know that it’s the one I meant?” “Very simple’, 
we may say “we compate it with our memory image.” But this 
explanation does not get to the root of our dissatisfaction. For 


7o 


how ate we given the method we’re to use in making the compari- 
son —i.e. how do we know what we’re to do when we’re told to 


compare ? 


In our language one of the functions of the word “red” is to 
call that particular colour to mind; and indeed it might be dis- 
covered that this word did so better than others, even that it alone 
served that purpose. But instead of the mechanism of association 
we might also have used a colour chart or some such apparatus; 
and then our calculus would have to get along with the associated, 
or visible, colour sample. The psychological effectiveness of a 
sign does not concern us. I wouldn’t even scruple to invent that 
kind of mechanism. 


Investigating whether the meaning of a word is its effect or its 
purpose, etc. is a grammatical investigation. 


34 Why can one understand a word and not a penholder? Is it 
the difference between their shapes ? But you will say that we could 
understand a penholder too, if we had given it a meaning. But then 
how is giving it a meaning done ? - How was meaning given to the 
word “red”? Well, you point at something, and you say “T call 
that ‘red’”’. Is that a kind of consecration of mystical formula? 
How does this pointing and uttering words work ? It works only 
as part of a system containing other bits of linguistic behaviour. 
And so now one can understand a penholder too; but does this 
understanding contain the whole system of its application? 
Impossible. We say that we understand its meaning when we know 
its use, but we’ve also said that the word “know” doesn’t denote 
a state of consciousness. That is: the grammar of the word “know” 
isn’t the grammar of a “state of consciousness”, but something 
different. And there is only one way to learn it: to watch how the 
word is used in practice. 


A truthful answer to the question “Did you understand the 


71 


i 
iW 
| 
} 


sentence (that you have just read)” is sometimes “yes” and some- 
times “no”. “So something different must take place when I 
understand it and when I don’t understand it.” 

Right. So when I understand a sentence something happens like 
being able to follow a melody as a melody, unlike the case when it’s 
so long or so developed that I have to say “I can’t follow this bit”. 
And the same thing might happen with a picture, and here I mean 
an ornament. First of all I see only a maze of lines ; then they group 
themselves for me into well-known and accustomed forms and I 
see a plan, a familiar system. If the ornamentation contains repre- 
sentations of well-known objects the recognition of these will 
indicate a further stage of understanding. (Think in this connec- 
tion of the solution of a puzzle picture.) I then say “Yes, now I see 
the picture rightly”. 

Asked “what happened when you read that sentence with under- 
standing” I would have to say “I read it as a group of English 
words linked in a familiar way’. I might also say that a picture 
came into my mind when I heard it. But then I am asked: “Is 
that all? After all, the understanding couldn’t consist in that and 
nothing else!” Well, that or something like it is all that happened 
while | read the sentence and immediately afterwards; but what we 
call “understanding” is related to countless things that happen 
before and after the reading of ¢his sentence. 

What of when I don’t understand a sentence ? Well, it might be a 
sentence in a foreign language and all I see is a row of unknown 
words. Or what I read seemed to be an English sentence, but it 
contained an unfamiliar phrase and when I tried to grasp it (and 
that again can mean various things) I didn’t succeed. (Think of 
what goes on when we try to understand the sense of a poem in our 
native language which makes use of constructions we don’t yet 
understand.) 

But I can say that I understand a sentence ina foreign language — 


72 


say a Latin one that I can only decipher by a painful effort to 
construe — even if I have only turned it into English bit by bit and 
have never succeeded in grasping the overall phrasing of the 


sentence. 


But all the same, in order to understand a sentence I have to 
understand the words in it! And when I read, I understand some 
words and not others. 

I hear a word and someone asks me “did you understand it?” 
and I reply truly “yes”. What happened when I understood ? How 
was the understanding different from what happens when I don’t 
understand a word ? — Suppose the word was “tree”. If Iam to say 
truly that I understood it, must the image of a tree have come before 
my mind ? No; nor must any other image. All I can say is that when 
I was asked “do you understand the word tree ?” I’d have answered 
“yes” unthinkingly and without lying. — If the other person had 
asked me further “and what is a tree ?” I would have described one 
for him, or shown him one, or drawn one; or perhaps I would have 
answered “I know, but I don’t want to explain.” And it may be 
that when I gave my reply the image of a tree came before my mind, 
or perhaps I looked for something which had some similarity with 
a tree, or perhaps other words came into my head, etc. etc. 7 

Let’s just look how we actually use the word “understand”. 7 

The word might also have been one of which I would say “I 
used to know what it meant, and it will come back to me”’, and then 
later on say “now it’s come back to me’”’, What happened then ? — 
Perhaps there came into my mind the situation in which the word 
was first explained to me: I saw myself in a room with others, etc. 
etc. (But if now I read and understand the word in a sentence that 
picture wouldn’t have to come before my mind; perhaps no 
picture at all comes to mind.) 

Or it was a word in a foreign language; and I had already often 
heard it, but never understood it. Perhaps I said to myself “what 
can it mean?” and tried to give it a meaning which fitted the con- 


nnn Se ee 


text (2gain various possibilities). Perhaps now this situation comes 
to mind and I say “I don’t understand the word’’. But I might also 
react immediately to the foreign word with the answer “I don’t 
understand it”, just as I reacted to the word “tree” with the 
opposite answer. 

Suppose it is the word “red” and I say automatically that I 
understood it; then he asks again “do you really understand it?” 
Then I summon up a red image in my mind as a kind of check. 
But how do J know that it’s the right colour that appears to me? 
And yet I say now with full conviction that I understand it. ~ But 
I might also look at a colour chart with the word ‘‘red” written 
beneath the colour. —-I could carry on for ever describing such 
processes. 


35 The problem that concerns us could be summed up roughly 
thus: “Must one see an image of the colour blue in one’s mind 
whenever one reads the word ‘blue’ with understanding?” 
People have often asked this question and have commonly ans- 
wered no; they have concluded from this answer that the character- 
istic process of understanding is just a different process which 
we’ve not yet grasped. — Suppose then by “understanding” we 
mean what makes the difference between reading with under- 
standing and reading without understanding; what does happen 
when we understand ? Well, “Understanding” is not the name of a 
single process accompanying reading or hearing, but of more or 
less interrelated processes against a background, or in a context, 
of facts of a particular kind, viz. the actual use of a learnt language or 
languages. We say that understanding is a “psychological 
process”, and this label is misleading, in this as in countless other 
cases. It compares understanding to a particular process like trans- 
lation from one language into another, and it suggests the same 
conception of thinking, knowing, wishing, intending, etc. That 
is to say, in all these cases we see that what we would perhaps 
naively suggest as the hallmark of such a process is not present in 


74 


every case or even in the majority of cases. And our next step is 
to conclude that the essence of the process is something difficult 
to grasp that still awaits discovery. For we say: since I use the word 
“understand” in all these cases, there must be some one thing 
which happens in every case and which is the essence of under- 
standing (expecting, wishing etc.). Otherwise, why should I call 
them by all the same name? 

This argument is based on the notion that what is needed to 
justify characterizing a number of processes or objects by a general 
concept-word is something common to them all. 

This notion is, in a way, too primitive. What a concept-word 
indicates is certainly a kinship between objects, but this kinship 
need not be the sharing of a common property or a constituent. It 
may connect the objects like the links of a chain, so that one is 
linked to another by intermediary links. Two neighbouring mem- 
bers may have common features and be simi/ar to each other, while 
distant ones belong to the same family without any longer having 
anything in common. Indeed even if a feature is common to all 
members of the family it need not be that feature that defines the 
concept. 

The relationship between the members of a concept may be set 
up by the sharing of features which show up in the family of the 
concept, crossing and overlapping in very complicated ways. 


Thus there is probably no single characteristic which is common 
to all the things we call games. But it can’t be said either that 
“game”? just has several independent meanings (rather like the 
word “bank”’). What we call “games” are procedures interrelated 
in various ways with many different transitions between one and 
another. 


It might be said that the use of the concept-word or common 
noun is justified in this case because there are transitional steps 


between the members. — Then it might be objected that a tran- 
sition can be made from anything to anything, and so the concept 
isn’t bounded. To this I have to say that for the most part it isn’t 
in fact bounded and the way to specify it is perhaps: ““by ‘know- 
ledge’ we mean these processes, and these, and similar ones’’. 
And instead of ‘‘and similar ones” I might have said ‘“‘and others 
akin to these in many ways”. 

But if we wish to draw boundaries in the use of a word, in order 
to clear up philosophical paradoxes, then alongside the actual 
picture of the use (in which as it were the different colours flow 
into one another without sharp boundaries) we may put another 
picture which is in certain ways like the first but is built up of 
colours with clear boundaries between them. 


Il 


36 If we look at the actual use of a word, what we see is something 
constantly fluctuating. 

In our investigations we set over against this fluctuation 
something more fixed, just as one paints a stationary picture of 
the constantly altering face of the landscape. 


When we study language we envisage it as a game with fixed 
rules. We compare it with, and measure it against, a game of that 


kind. 


If for our purposes we wish to regulate the use of a word by 
definite rules, then alongside its fluctuating use we set up a different 
use by codifying one of its characteristic aspects. 


Thus it could be said that the use of the word “good” (in an 
ethical sense) is a combination of a very large number of inter- 
related games, each of them as it were a facet of the use. What makes 
a single concept here is precisely the connection, the relationship, 
between these facets. 


But this isn’t like the way physics gives a simplified description 
of a natural phenomenon, abstracting from secondary factors. It 
can’t be said that logic depicts an idealised reality, or that it holds 
strictly only for an ideal language and so on. For where do we 
get the concept of this ideal ? The most that could be said is that 
we ate constructing an ideal language which contrasts with ordinary 
language; but it can’t be said that we are saying something that 
would hold only of an ideal language. 


37 There is something else I would like to say about the under- 
standing of a picture. Take a genre-picture: we say we understand

it if we recognise what is happening in it, what the people in it are 
doing. Here the criterion for this recognition is perhaps that if 
asked what they are doing we explain it in words or represent it in 
mime etc. It’s possible that this recognition doesn’t come easily, 
perhaps because we don’t immediately see the figures in the picture 
as figures (as in puzzle pictures), perhaps because we can’t make 
out what they are doing together, etc. In these cases there may be 
a period of doubt followed by a familiar process of recognition. 
On the other hand, it may be the kind of picture we’d say we took 
in at first glance, and in that case we find it difficult to say what the 
understanding really consists of. In the first place what happened 
was not that we took the painted objects for real ones. And again 
“I understand it’? in this case doesn’t mean that finally, after an 
effort, I understand that it is #Aés picture. And nothing takes place 
like recognizing an old acquaintance in the street, no saying “oh, 
there’s...”’. If you insist on saying there is a recognition, what 
does this recognition consist of ? Perhaps I recognize a certain part 
of the picture as a human face. Do I have to look at a real face, or 
call before my mind’s eye the memory of a face I’ve seen before ? 
Is what happens that I rummage in the cupboard of my memory 
until I find something which resembles the picture ? Is the recog- 
nition just this finding? In our case there is no one thing that 
happens that could be called recognition, and yet if the person who 
sees the picture is asked “do you recognize what it is?” he may 
truly answer “yes’’, or perhaps reply “it is a face”. It can indeed be 
said that when he sees the complex of signs as a face he sees some- 
thing different from when he doesn’t do so. In that case I'd like to 
say that I see something /ami/iar' in front of me. But what con- 
stitutes the familiarity is not the historical fact that I’ve often seen 
objects like that etc; because the history behind the experience is 
certainly not present in the experience itself. Rather, the familiarity 


1. Cf. p. 165f (Ed.) 


78 


lies in the fact that I immediately grasp a particular ryhthm of the 
picture and stay with it, fell at home with it, so to speak. For the 
rest it is a different experience that constitutes the familiarity in 
each particular case; a picture of a table carries one experience with 
it and a picture of a bed another. 

If I say: “I understand this picture” the question arises: do I 
mean “I understand it /ke that’’? With the ‘Uke that” standing for 
a translation of what I understand into a different expression ? Or 
is it a sort of intransitive understanding ? When I’m understanding 
one thing do I as it were think of another thing? Does under- 
standing, that is, consist of thinking of something else? And if 
that isn’t what I mean, then what’s understood is as it were 
autonomous, and the understanding of it is comparable to the 
understanding of a melody. 


(It is interesting to observe that the pictures which come before 
out minds when we read an isolated word and try to understand 
it correctly just like that are commonly altogether absent when we 
read a sentence; the picture that comes before our minds when we 
read a sentence with understanding is often something like a 
resultant of the whole sentence). 


38 It is possible for a person to forget the meaning of a word 
(e.g. “blue”). What has he forgotten ? — How is that manifested ? 

He may point, for instance, to a chart of different colours and 
say “I don’t know any longer which of these is called ‘blue’”’.Or 
again, he may not any longer know at all what the word means 
(what purpose it serves); he may know only that is it an English 
word. 

We might say: if someone has forgotten the meaning of the 
word “blue” and is asked to choose a blue object from among 
others he feels as he looks at the objects that the connection between 
the word “blue” and the colour no longer holds but has been 
broken off. The connection will be reestablished, it might be said, 
if we repeat the definition of the word for him. But we might 
reestablish the connection in various ways: we might point to a 
blue object and say “that is blue”, or say “remember your blue 


79 


patch” or we perhaps utter the German word “blaw’’, etc. etc. 
And if I now say there are these different ways in which we can 
establish the connection this suggests there’s a single particular 
phenomenon I call the connection between word and colour, or 
the understanding of the word, a phenomenon I’ve produced in 
all these different ways, just as I can use objects of different shapes 
and materials as conductors to connect the ends of two wires. But 
there is no need for such a phenomenon of connection, no need, 
say, that when I hear the word a picture of the colour should occur 
before my inner eye. For if what is reestablished in his under- 
standing of the word, this can manifest itself in very various 
processes. There isn’t a further process hidden behind, which is 
the real understanding, accompanying and causing these mani- 
festations in the way that toothache causes one to groan, hold 
one’s cheek, pull faces, etc. If 1am now asked if I think that there’s 
no such thing as understanding but only manifestations of under- 
standing, I must answer that this question is ‘as senseless as the 
question whether there is a number three. I can only describe 
piecemeal the grammar of the word “understand” and point out 
that it differs from what one is inclined to portray without looking 
closely. We are like the little painter Klecksel who drew two eyes 
in a man’s profile, since he knew that human beings have two eyes. 


39 The effect of an explanation of the meaning of a word is like 
‘knowing how to go on’, when you recite the beginning of a 
poem to someone until he says “now I know how to go on”. 
(Tell yourself the various psychological forms this knowing how 
to go on may take.) 


The way in which language was learnt is not contained in its use. 
(Any more than the cause is contained in the effect.) 


How does an ostensive definition work ? Is it put to work again 


80 


every time the word is used, or is it like a vaccination which changes 
us once and for all? 


A definition as a part of the calculus cannot act at a distance. It 
acts only by being applied. 


40 Once more: in what cases shall we say that the man understands 
the word “blue”? Well, if he picks out a blue object from others on 
demand; or if he credibly says that he could now pick out the blue 
object but doesn’t want to (perhaps we notice that while he says 
this he glances involuntarily at the blue object; perhaps we 
believe him simply on account of his previous behaviour). And 
how does se know that he understands the word? i.e. in what 
circumstances will 4e be able to say it ? Sometimes after some kind 
of test, but sometimes also without. But in that case won’t he 
sometimes have to say later “I was wrong, I did not understand it 
after all” if it turns out that he can’t apply it ? Can he justify himself 
in such cases by saying that he did indeed understand the word 
when he said he did, but that the meaning later slipped his memory ? 
Well, what can he offer as a criterion (proof) that he did understand 
the word at the previous time? — Perhaps he says “At that time I 
saw the colour in my mind’s eye, but now I can’t remember it.” 
Well, if that implies that he understood it, he did understand it 
then. ~ Or he says: “I can only say I’ve used the word a hundred 
times before”, or “I’d used it just before, and while I was saying I 
understood it I was thinking of that occasion.” It is what is regarded 


as the justification of an assertion that constitutes the sense of the 
assertion. 


Suppose we say “he understands the word ‘blue’, he picked the 
blue ball out from the others right away” and then he says “ I just 
picked it out by guesswork, I didn’t understand the word”. What 
sort of criterion did he have for not having understood the word ? 
Ought we to believe him ? If one asks oneself “How do I know that 


81 


I don’t understand this word” it produces a very strange thought 
sensation. One wants to say “ I don’t connect anything with it’, 
“it says nothing to me”, “It’s a mere noise”, and in order to 
understand these utterances one has to call to mind what it’s like 
“when one connects something with a word”, when a definition 
has made the sound into a meaningful word, when one can do 
something with the word. 

You will say: “But he certainly can’t be wrong when he says that 
he didn’t understand the word.” And that is an observation about 
the grammar of the statement “I didn’t understand the word”. It 
is also an observation about grammar when we say, “Whether he 
understood, is something he knows which we cannot vow but 
only guess”. Moreover the statement “I didn’t understand the 
word” doesn’t describe a state at the time of hearing the word; 
there are many different ways in which the processes characteristic 
of not understanding may have taken place later. 


41 We speak of understanding (a process of understanding, and 
also a state of understanding) and also of certain processes which 
are criteria for this understanding. 

We are inclined to call understanding a mental process or a state 
of mind. This characterizes it as a hypothetical process etc., of 
rather as a process (or state) in the sense of a hypothesis. That is, 
we banish the word “understanding” to a particular region of 
grammar. 


The grammar of a mental state or process is indeed in many 
respects similar to that of e.g. a brain-process. The principal 
difference is perhaps that in the case of a brain-process a direct 
check is admitted to be possible; the process in question may 
perhaps be seen by opening the skull. But there is no room for a 
similar “immediate perception” in the grammar of mental process. 
(There is no such move in this game.) 


82 


What is the criterion for our understanding the word “red”? 
That we pick out a red object from others on demand, or that we 
can give the ostensive definition of the word “red” ? 

We regard both things as signs of understanding. If we hear 
someone use the word “red” and are in doubt whether he under- 
stands it, we can check by asking: “‘which colour do you call red?” 
On the other hand, if we’d given someone the ostensive definition 
of the word and then wanted to see whether he’d understood it 
rightly, we wouldn’t ask him to repeat it, but we would set him a 
task like picking out the red objects from a row. 


Here it can be asked: “‘are we talking about my understanding or 
other people’s understanding ?” 

“Only I can know whether I understand, others can only guess.” 
“ “He understands’ is a hypothesis; ‘I understand’ is not.” 

If that’s what we say, then we’re conceiving “‘understanding”’ 
as an experience, analogous e.g. to a pain. 

People say: “You cannot know whether I understand (whether 
Iam glad), etc.; you can’t look inside me.” “You can’t know what 
I think.” Yes, but that’s so only as long as you don’t think aloud; 
and we aren’t interested here in the difference between thinking 
out loud (or in writing) and thinking in the imagination. 


Here you may object that thinking is after all private even if 
it is only the visual experience of writing, and that though another 
person can see what my physical hand is writing he cannot have 
my visual experience. These questions must occupy us in another 
place. 


But for our present purpose can’t we say “he is writing” and 


“T am writing” instead of “he understands” and “I understand ?” 
Then we leave the question of experience completely out of the 


83 


game. Also, for instance, the question of private understanding. 
For then it appears unimportant here. 

What we call “understanding” is not the behaviour—whatever 
it may be — that shows us the understanding, but a state of which 
this behaviour is a sign. And that is a statement about the grammar 
of denoting such a state. 


42 We might call the recital of the rules on its own a criterion for 
understanding, or alternatively tests of use on their own. Then in 
the one case “he understands” would mean: “if you ask him for 
for the rules, he will tell you them” ; in the other case “if you require 
him to apply the rule, he will carry out your order’’. 

Or we may regard the recital of the rules as a symptom of the 
man’s being able to do something other than recite the rules. As 
when I hold a watch to my ear, hear it ticking and say: it is going. 
In that case I don’t just expect it to go on ticking, but also to show 
the time. 


One might say: ““The recital of the rules is a criterion of under- 
standing, if the man recites them with understanding and not 
purely mechanically.” But here once again an intelligent intonation 
during the recitation can count as understanding; and so why not 
the recitation itself? 


To understand is to grasp, to receive a particular impression from 
an object, to let it work on one. To let a proposition work on one; 
to consider consequences of the proposition, to imagine them, etc. 


What we call “understanding” is a psychological phenomenon 
that has a special connection with the phenomena of learning and 
using our human language. 


What happens when I remember the meaning of a word? I see 
before me an object of a certain colour and I say “this book 1s 


84 


brown and I have always called this colour ‘brown’ ”’. What sort of 
act of remembering must take place for me to be able to say that ? 
This question could be put in a much more general form. For 
instance, if someone asked me “have you ever before seen the 
table at which you are now sitting ?” I would answer “yes, I have 
seen it countless times’’. And if I were pressed I would say “‘I have 
sat at it every day for months”. - What act or acts of remembering 
occur in such a case? After all I don’t see myself in my mind’s eye 
“sitting at this table every day for months”. And yet I say that I 
remember that I’ve done so, and I can later corroborate it in various 
ways. Last summer too, for example, I was living in this room. 
But how do I know that? Do I see it in my mind’s eye? No. In this 
case what does the remembering consist of ? If I as it were hunt for 
the basis of the memory, isolated pictures of my earlier sojourn 
surface in my mind; but even so they don’t have, say, a date written 
into them. And even before they’ve surfaced and before I’ve called 
any particular evidence into my mind, I can say truly that I remem- 
ber that I lived here for months and saw this table. Remembering, 
then, isn’t at all the mental process that one imagines at first sight. 
If I say, rightly, “I remember it’? the most varied things may 
happen; perhaps even just that I say it. And when I here say 
“rightly” of course I’m not laying down what the right and wrong 
use of the expression is; on the contrary I’m just describing the 
actual use. 


The psychological process of understanding is in the same case 
as the arithmetical object Three. The word “process” in the one 
case, and the word “object” in the other producea false grammatical 
attitude to the word. 


43 Isn’tit like this ? First of all, people use an explanation, a chart, 


by looking it up; later they as it were look it up in the head (by 
calling it before the inner eye, or the like) and finally they work 


85 


without the chart, as if it had never existed. In this last case they are 
playing a different game. For it isn’t as if the chart is still in the 
background, to fall back on; it is excluded from our game, and if 
I “fall back on it” I am like a blinded man falling back on the sense 
of touch. An explanation provides a chart and when I no longer 
use the chart it becomes mete history. 


I must distinguish between the case in which I follow the table, 
and the case in which I behave in accordance with the table without 
making use of it.—- The rule we learnt which makes us now 
behave in such and such a way is of no interest to us considered as 
the cause or history behind our present behaviour. — But as a 
general description of our manner of behaving it is a hypothesis. 
It is the hypothesis that the two people who sit at the chess board 
will behave (move) in such and such a manner. (Here even a breach 
of the rules falls under the hypothesis, since it says something about 
the behaviour of the players when they become aware of the 
breach). But the players might also use the rules by looking up in 
each particular case whatis to be done; here the rule would enter into 
the conduct of the game itself and would not be related to it as 
hypothesis to confirmation. But there is a difficulty here. For a 
player who plays without using the list of rules, and indeed has 
never seen one, might nevertheless if asked give the rules of his 
game — not by ascertaining through repeated observation what he 
does in such and such a position in the game, but by superintending 
a move and saying “in such a case ¢his is how one moves’. — But, if 
that is so, that just shows that in certain circumstances he can enun- 
ciate the rules, not that he makes explicit use of them while playing. 

It is a hypothesis that he will if asked recite a list of rules; if a 
disposition or capacity for this is postulated in him, it is a psycho- 
logical disposition analogous to a physiological one. If it is said 


86 


that this disposition characterizes the process of playing, it 
characterizes it as the psychological or physiological one it really 
is. (In our study of symbolism there is no foreground and back- 
ground; it isn’t a matter of a tangible sign with an accompanying 
intangible power or understanding.) 


44 What interests ws in the sign, the meaning which matters for 
us is what is embodied in the grammar of the sign. 


We ask “How do you use the word, what do you do with it” - 
that will tell us how you understand it. 


Grammar is the account books of language. They must show 
the actual transactions of language, everything that is not a matter 
of accompanying sensations. 


In a certain sense one might say that we are not concerned with 
nuances. 


(I could imagine a philosopher who thought that he must have 
a prtoposition about the essence of knowing printed in red, 
otherwise it would not really express what it was meant to express.) 


87 


IV 


45 The interpretation of written and spoken signs by ostensive 
definitions is not an application of language, but part of the gram- 
mar. The interpretation remains at the level of generality pre- 
paratory to any application. 


The ostensive definition may be regarded as a rule for trans- 
lating from a gesture language into a word language. If I say “the 
colour of this object is called ‘violet’”, I must already have denoted 
the colour, already presented it for christening, with the words 
“the colour of that object” if the naming is to be able to take place. 
For I might also say “the name of this colour is for you to decide”’ 
and the man who gives the name would in that case already have 
to know what he is to name (where in the language he is stationing 
the name). 


That one empirical proposition is true and another false is no 
part of grammar. What belongs to grammar are all the conditions 
(the method) necessary for comparing the proposition with 
reality. That is, all the conditions necessary for the understanding 
(of the sense). 


In so far as the meaning of words becomes clear in the fulfilment 
of an expectation, in the satisfaction of a wish, in the carrying out 
of an order etc., it already shows itself when we put the expectation 
into language. It is therefore completely determined in the gram- 
mar, in what could be foreseen and spoken of already before the 
occurrence of the event. 


46 Does our language consist of primary signs (ostensive gestures) 
and secondary signs (words)? One is inclined to ask, whether it 
isn’t the case that our language Aas to have primary signs while it 
could get by without the secondary ones. 

The false note in this question is that it expects an explanation of 


88 


existing language instead of a mere description. 


It sounds like a ridiculous truism to say that a man who thinks 
that gestures are the primitive signs underlying all others would 
not be able to replace an ordinary sentence by gestures. 


One is inclined to make a distinction between rules of grammar 
that set up “a connection between language and reality” and those 
that do not. A rule of the first kind is ‘‘this colour is called ‘red’ ”’, 
~a rule of the second kind is “~~ p =p”. With regard to this 
distinction there is a common error; language is not something 
that is first given a structure and then fitted on to reality. 


One might wish to ask: So is it an accident that in order to 
define signs and complete the sign-system I have to go outside the 
written and spoken signs? When I do that don’t I go right into 
the realm where what is to be described occurs ? — But in that case 
isn’t it strange that I can do anything at all with the written signs ? 
~ We say perhaps that the written signs are mere representatives 
of the things the ostensive definition points to. - But how then is 
this representing possible? I can’t after all make just anything 
stand in for anything else.—It is indeed important that such 
representing is possible; for the representative must, in certain 
cases at least, do the job as well as the principal. 


47 We say that something like a red label is the primary sign for the 
colour red, and the word is a secondary sign, because the meaning 
of the word “‘red” is explained if I point, etc. toa red label, but not 
if I say “red” means the same as “rouge”. But don’t I explain the 
meaning of the word “red” to a Frenchman in just this way? 
“Yes, but only because he has learnt the meaning of ‘rouge’ by 
ostensive definition’’. But if he understands my explanation “red = 


rouge” does he have to have this definition — or a red image — 
present to his mind ? If not, it is mere history. Must he have such a 
picture present whenever we would say he was using the word 
“rouge” with understanding ? (Think of the order: “Imagine a 
round red patch.”’) 


48 Are the signs one wants to call ‘primary’ incapable of being 
misinterpreted P 

Can one perhaps say, they don’t really any longer need to be 
understood? —If that means that they don’t have to be further 
interpreted, that goes for words too; if it means, they cannot be 
further interpreted, then it’s false. (Think of the explanation of 
gestures by words and vice versa). 


Is it correct, and if so in what sense, to say that the ostensive 
definition is like the verbal definition in replacing one sign by 
another — the pointing by the word? 


49 Suppose I lay down a method of designation. Suppose, for 
example, I want to give names to shades of colours for my private 
use. I may do so by means of a chart; and of course I won’t write 
a name beside a wrong colour (beside a colour I don’t want to give 
that name to). Bug why not? Why shouldn’t “red” go beside the 
green label and “green” beside the red, etc.? If the ostensive 
definition merely replaces one sign by another, that shouldn’t 
make any difference. Here there are at any rate two different 
possibilities. It may be that the table with green beside “red” is 
used in such a way that a man who ‘looks it up’ goes diagonally 
from the word “red” to the red label, and from the word “green” 
to the green one and so on. We would then say that though the 
table was arranged differently (had a different spatial scheme) it 
connected the signs in the same way as the usual one. — But it 
might also be that the person using the table looks from one side 
horizontally to another, and in some sentences uses a green label 
instead of the word “red”, and yet obeys an order like “give me a 


go 


red book” not by bringing a green book, but perfectly correctly 
by bringing a red one (i.e. one that we too would call “red”). 
Such a man would have used the table in a different way from the 
first, but still in such a way that the word “red”? means the same 
colour for him as it does for us. 

Now it is the second case which interests us, and the question is: 
can a green label be a sample of red ? — 

I can imagine an arrangement according to which a man to 
whom I show a green label with the words “‘paint me this colour” 
is to paint me red and if I show him blue with the same words, is 
to paint me yellow (always the complementary colour). And 
someone might interpret my order in that way even without such 
a convention. The convention might also have been “if I say 
‘paint this colour’, then always paint one slightly darker’, aa 
again we could imagine the order being thus interpreted even 
without this prearrangement.— But can it be said that when 
someone is painting a certain shade of green he is copying the red of 
the label-as he may copy a geometrical figure according to 
various methods of projection, copying it in different but equally 
exact ways? ~ Can I compare colours with shapes? Can a green 
label be used both as the name of a particular shade of red, and 
also as a sample of it just as a circle can serve as the name of a 
particular elliptical shape, and also as a sample for it ? 


It is clear that a sample is not used like a word (a name). And an 
ostensive definition, a table, which leads us from words to samples 
. . . : 
is used differently from a table which replaces one name by another. 


so However, the word “copy” has different meanings in different 
cases and what I mean by “‘pattern’’? changes correspondingly. 
What does “to copy a figure exactly” mean ? Does it mean copy it 
exactly with the unaided eye ? Or with measuring instruments, and 
if so which? What shall we be willing to call the same colour as 
that of the pattern ? Think of various methods of comparison. How 
far is the rule to copy darker comparable to a rule to copy a figure 


ona larger, or small scale? 

Imagine a man who claimed to be able to copy shades of red 
into green, who fixed his eye on a red sample and with every out- 
ward sign of exact copying mixed a shade of green. For us he 
would be ona par with someone who listened carefully and mixed 
colours in accordance with notes on a violin. In such a case we'd 
say “I don’t know sow he does it”; not because we didn’t under- 
stand the processes in his brain or in his muscles, but because we 
don’t understand what is meant by “this shade of colour is a copy 
of this note on the violin”. Unless that means that as a matter of 
experience a man associates a particular shade of colour with a 
particular note(sees itin his mind’s eye, paints it etc). The difference 
between the meanings of “associate” and “copy” shows itself in 
the fact that it doesn’t make sense to speak of a projection-method 
(rule of translation) for association. We say: “you haven’t copied 
correctly”, but not “you haven’t associated correctly”. 


On the other hand it is certainly conceivable that human beings 
might agree so exactly with each other in associating colours with 
violin notes that one might say to another: “No, you haven’t 
represented that violin note correctly, it was yellower than you 
painted it” and the other would answer something like “you're 
right, the same thought occurred to me”. 


51 If the table connects the word with a sample, then it isn’t in- 
different which label the word is linked with when the table is 
consulted — “So then there are signs that are arbitrary and signs 
that are not!” Compare the giving of information by maps and 
drawings, with the giving of information by sentences. The 
sentences are no more arbitrary than the drawings are; only the 
words are arbitrary. On the other hand the projection of the maps 
is arbitrary; and how would you decide which of the two is the 
mote arbitrary ? 


92 


Certainly I can compare deciding on the meanings of words 
with deciding on a method of projection, such as that for the 
representation of spatial forms (“the proposition is a picture”). 
That is a good comparison, but it doesn’t exempt us from investi- 
gating the way words signify, which has its own rules. We can of 
course say ~— that is, it accords with usage — that we communicate 
by signs whether we use words or patterns, but the game of acting 
in accordance with words is not the same game as acting in accor- 
dance with patterns. (Words are not essential to what we call 
“language”, and neither are samples). Word-language is only one 
of many possible kinds of language, and there are transitions 
between one kind and another. (Think of two ways of writing the 
proposition “I see a red circle”: it might be done by writing a 
circle and giving it the appropriate colour (red), or by writing a 
circle with a red patch beside it. Consider what corresponds in a 
map to the form of expression of a word-language.) 


52 “I won’t insist that the red pattern in the explanatory chart must 
be horizontally opposite the word ‘red’, but there must be some 
sort of law for reading the table or it will lose its sense.”? But is 


there no law if the chart is read in the way indicated by the arrows 
of the following schema? 


“But in that case wustn’t this schema of arrows be given in ad- 


vance?” - Well, must you give this schema before we follow the 
normal use?

“But in that case mustn’t there at least be a regularity through 
time in the use of the table? Would it work if we were to use the 
table in accordance with different schemata at different times? 
How would one know in that case how the table was to be used?” 
Well, how does one know anyway? Explanations of signs come 
to an end somewhere. 

Of course if I showed someone the way by pointing my finger not 
in the direction in which he was to go, but in the opposite direction, 
in the absence of a special arrangement I should cause a misunder- 
standing. It is part of human nature to understand pointing with 
the finger in the way we do. (As it is also part of human nature to 
play board games and to use sign languages that consist of written 
signs on a flat surface.) 


The chart doesn’t guarantee that I shall pass from one part of it 
to another in a uniform manner. It doesn’t compel me to use it 
always in the same way. It’s there, like a field, with paths leading 
through it: but I can also cut across. - Each time I apply the chart 
I make a fresh transition. The transitions aren’t made as it were once 
for all the chart (the chart merely suggests to me that I make 
them). 

(What kind of propositions are these?- They are like the 
observation that explanations of signs come to an end somewhere. 
And that is rather like saying “How does it help you to postulate 
a creator, it only pushes back the problem of the beginning of the 
word.” This observation brings out an aspect of my explanation 
that I perhaps hadn’t noticed. One might also say: “Look at your 
explanation in ¢his way — now are you still satisfied with it ??) 


53 Is the word “red” enough to enable one to look for something 
red? Does one need a memory image to do so? 


Can one say that the word “red” needs a supplement in memory 


in order to be a usable sign? 
If Luse the words “there is a red book in front of me”’ to describe 


an experience, is the justification of the choice of these words, 


94 


apart from the experience described, the fact that I remember that 
I’ve always used the word “red” for this colour? Does that have fo 
be the justification ? 


In order to be ableto obey a spoken order do we need something 
like a memory picture of what we did when we last obeyed it ? 

So is the real order “Do now what you remember doing then” ? 
This order too might be given. But does that mean that in order to 
obey it, I need a memory image of searching my memory ? 

The order “do now what you remember doing then” tells me 
that Iam to look ina particular place for a picture that will tell me 
what I am to do. So the order is very similar to “Do what is written 
on the piece of paper in this drawer’’. If there is nothing on the 
piece of paper then the order lacks sense. 


If the use of the word “red” depends on the picture that my 
memory automatically reproduces at the sound of this word, then 
Tam as much at mercy of this reproduction as if I had decided to 
settle the meaning by looking up a chart in sucha way that I would 
surrender unconditionally to whatever I found there. 


If the sample I am to work with appears darker than I remember 
it being yesterday, I need not agree with the memory and in fact 


Ido not always do so. And I might very well speak of a darkening 
of my memory. 


54 If I tell someone “paint from memory the colour of the door 
of your room” that doesn’t settle what he is to do any more un- 
ambiguously than the order “paint the green you see on this chart”’. 
Here too it is imaginable that the first of the sentences might be 
understand in the way one would normally understand a sentence 


95 


like “paint a colour somewhat lighter than the one you remember 
seeing there”. On the other hand the man ordered to paint the 
shade of colour in accordance with the sample will usually be in 
no doubt about the method of projection. 


If Pm told: “look for a red flower in this meadow and bring it 
to me” and then I find one — do I compare it with my memory 
picture of the colour red ? — And must I consult yet another picture 
to see whether the first is still correct ? — In that case why should 
I need the first one? — I see the colour of the flower and recognize 
it. (It would naturally be conceivable that someone should hallucinate 
a colour sample‘and compare it, like a real sample, with the object 
he was looking for.) 

But if I say “no, this colour isn’t the right one, it’s brighter than 
the colour I saw there” that doesn’t mean that I see the colour in 
my mind’s eye and go through a process of comparing two simul- 
taneously given shades of colour. Again, it isn’t as if when the 
right colour is found a bell rings somewhere in my mind and I 
carry round a picture of this ringing, so as to be able to judge when 
it rings. 


Searching with a sample which one places beside objects to test 
whether the colours match is one game; acting in accordance with 
the words of a word-language without a sample is another. Think 
of reading aloud from a written text (ot writing to dictation). We 
might of course imagine a kind of table that might guide us in this; 
but in fact there isn’t one, there’s no act of memory, of anything 
else, which acts as an intermediary between the written sign and the 


sound. 


35 Suppose I am now asked “‘why do you choose ¢his colour when 
given this order; how do you justify the choice ?”’ In the one case 
I can answer “because his colour is opposite the word ‘red’ in 
my chart.” In the other case there is no answer to the question and 
the question makes no sense. But in the first game there is no sense 
in this question: “why do you call ‘red’? the colour in the chart 


opposite the word ‘red’”’? A reason can only be given within a 
game. The links of the chain of reasons come to an end, at the 
boundary of the game. (Reason and cause.) 


If one calls to mind “that the chart does not compel us” to use it 
in a particular way, or even always to use it in the same way, it 
becomes clear to everyone that our use of the words “rule” and 
“game” is a fluctuating one (blurred at the edges). 


The connection between “language and reality” is made by 
definitions of words, and these belong to grammar, so that lan- 
guage remains self-contained and autonomous. 


56 Imagine a gesture language used to communicate with people 
who have no word-language in common with us. Do we feel there 
too the need to go outside the language to explain its signs ? 


“The connection between words and things is set up by the 
teaching of language.”’ What kind or sort of connection is this ? A 
mechanical, electrical, psychological connection is something 
which may or may not function. Mechanism and Calculus. 

The correlation between objects and names is simply the one set 
up by achart, by ostensive gestures and simultaneous uttering of the 
name etc. It is a part of the symbolism. Giving an object a name is 
essentially the same kind of thing as hanging a label on it. 

It gives the wrong idea if you say that the connection between 
name and object is a psychological one. 


57 Imagine someone copying a figure on the scale of 1 to 10. Is the 


understanding of the general rule of such mapping contained in 
the process of copying? — The pencil in my hand was free from 


97 


presuppositions, so to speak, and was guided (influenced) only by 
the length of the lines in the pattern. —I would say that if the 
pattern had been longer, I should have drawn my pencil further 
and if it had been shorter, not so far. But is the mind which thus 
expresses itself already contained in the copying of the line ? 

Suppose I want to meet someone on the street. I can decide “I 
will go on until I find N” - and then go along the street and stop 
when I meet him at a particular point. Did the process of walking, 
ot some other simultaneous process, include acting in accordance 
with the general rule I intended? Or was what I did only zw agree- 
ment with that rule, but also in agreement with other rules? 


4 
1 
ee 
b 
I give someone the order to draw from A a line parallel to a. 
He tries (intends) to do it, but with the result that the line is 
parallel to b. Was what happened when he copied the same as if 


he had intended to draw a line parallel to b and carried out his 
intention ? 


If I succeed in reproducing a paradigm in accordance with a 
prescribed rule, is it possible to use a different general rule to 
describe the process of copying, the way it took place? Or can I 
reject such a description with the words “No, I was guided by shzs 
rule, and not by the other, though admittedly in this case the other 
would have given the same result”’ ? 


58 One is inclined to say: If I] intentionally copy a shape, then the 
process of copying has the shape in common with the pattern. The 
form is a facet of the process of copying; a facet which fits the 
copied object and coincides with it there. 


98 


Even if my pencil doesn’t do justice to the model, my intention 


always does. 


If I intend to play the piano from written music, it is experience 
that will show which notes I actually play and the description of 
what is played need not have anything in common with the written 
notes. But if I want to describe my tention, the description must 
be that I wanted to reproduce shese written notes in sounds. — That 
alone can be the expression of the fact that intention reaches up to 
the paradigm and contains a general rule. 


An expression of intention describes the model to be copied; 
describing the copy does not. 


59 For the purposes of our studies it can never be essential that a 
symbolic phenomenon occurs in the mind and not on paper so 
that others can see it. One is constantly tempted to explain a 
symbolic process by a special psychological process; as if the mind 
“could do much more in these matters” than signs can. 

- We are misled by the idea of a mechanism that works in special 
media and so can explain special movements. As when we say: 
this movement can’t be explained by any arrangement of levers. 


A description of what is psychological must be something which 
can itself be used as a symbol. 


A connected point is that an explanation of a sign can replace the 
sign itself. This gives an important insight into the nature of the 
explanation of signs, and brings out a contrast between the idea 
of this sort of explanation and that of causal explanation. 


60 It could be said that it can’t be decided by outward observation 
whether I am reading or merely producing sounds while a text runs 
before my eyes. But what is of interest to us in reading can’t 
be essentially something interna/. Deriving a translation from the 


original may also be a visible process. For instance, it must be 
possible to regard as a derivation what takes place on paper when 
the terms of the series 100, 121, 144, 169 are derived from the 
terms of the series 10, 11, 12, 13 by the following calculations 


10 X IO II XII 12X12 13 X13 
00 11 24 39 

, . , 
100 121 144 169 


(The distinction between “inner” and “outer” does not interest 
us.) 


Every such more or less behaviourist account leaves one with the 
feeling that it is crude and heavy handed; but this is misleading — 
we are tempted to look for a “better” account, but there isn’t one. 
One is as good as the other and in each case what represents is the 
system in which a sign is used. — (‘Representation is dynamic, not 
static.”’). 

(Even a psychological process cannot “leave anything open” 
in any way essentially different from the way in which an empty 
bracket in the symbolism leaves open an argument place.) 


One may not ask “What sort of thing are mental processes, since 
they can be true and false, and non-mental ones cannot?” For, if 
the ‘mental’ ones can, then the others must be able to do as well and 
vice versa. —- For, if the mental processes can, their descriptions 
must be able to as well. For how this is possible must show itself 
in their descriptions. 


If one says that thought is a mental activity, or an activity of the 
mind, one thinks of the mind as a cloudy gaseous medium in which 
many things can happen which cannot occur in a different sphere, 
and from which many things can be expected that are otherwise 
not possible. 

(The process of thinking in the human mind, and the process of 
digestion).

61 Every case of copying (acting in obedience to, not just in 
accordance with, particular rules), every case of deriving an action 
from a command or justifying an action by a command, is the same 
kind of thing as writing down the steps that lead to the answer of 
a sum, or pointing to signs standing beside each other in a table. 


“JT write the number ‘16’ here because it says ‘x?’ there, and ‘64’ 
here because it says x} there.”” That is what every justification looks 
like. In a certain sense it takes us no further. But indeed it can’t 
take us further i.e. into the realm of metalogic. 

(The difficulty here is: in not trying to justify what admits of 
no justification.) 


Suppose, though, I said “I write a ‘4’ here because it says ‘x?’ 
there ? You would ask “Do you always write a ‘+’ where it says 
“x?” — that is, you would look for a general rule; otherwise the 
“because” in my sentence makes no sense. Or you might ask 
“So how do you know that shat is why you wrote it ?” 

In that case you’ve taken the “because”’ as introducing a state- 
ment of the cause, instead of the reason. 


If I write “16” under “4” in accordance with the rule, it might 
appear that some causality was operating that was not a matter of 
hypothesis, but something immediately perceived (experienced). 

(Confusion between ‘reason’ and ‘cause’.) 


What connection do I mean in the sentence “I am going out, 
because he’s telling me to”? And how is this sentence related to 
“TI am going out, a/though he told me to”. (Or “I am going out, 
but not because he told me to” “I am going out, because he told 
me not to”’.)

62 “That’s him’ (this picture represents Aim) — that contains the 
whole problem of representation. 

What is the criterion, how is it to be verified, that this picture is 
the portrait of that object, i.e. that it is meant to represent it ? It is 
not similarity that makes the picture a portrait (it might be a 
striking resemblance of one person, and yet be a portrait of some- 
one else it resembles less). 

How can I know that someone means the picture as a portrait 
of N ? — Well, perhaps because he says so, or writes it underneath. 

What is the connection between the portrait of N and N him- 
self? Perhaps, that the name written underneath is the name used 
to address him. 


When I remember my friend and see him “in my mind’s eye”, 
what is the connection between the memory image and its sub- 
ject? The likeness between them ? 

Well, the image, gua picture, can’t do more than resemble him. 


The image of him is an unpainted portrait. 
In the case of the image too, I have to write his name under the 
picture to make it the image of him. 


T have the intention of carrying out a particular task and JI make 
a plan. The plan in my mind is supposed to consist in my seeing 
myself acting thus and so. But how do I know, that it is myself 
that I’m seeing ? Well, it isn’t myself, but a kind of a picture. But 
why do I call it the picture of me? 

“How do I know that it’s myself ?”: the question makes sense if 


it means, for example, “how do I know that I’m the oneI see there’. 


And the answer mentions characteristics by which I can be recog- 
nized. 

But it is my own decision that makes my image represent myself. 
And I might as well ask “chow do I know that the word ‘T’ stands 
for myself >’? For my shape in the picture was only another word 
Sep?

“I can imagine your being about to go out of the door.” We 
suffer from a strange delusion that in the proposition, the thought, 
the objects do what the proposition states about them. It’s as 
though the command contained a shadow of the execution. But 
a shadow of just 47s execution. It is you in the command who go to 
such and such a place. ~ Otherwise it would be just a different 
command. 

This identity is indeed the identity contrasted with the diversity 
of two different commands. 


“T thought Napoleon was crowned in the year 1805.” — What 
has your thought got to do with Napoleon ? — What connection 
is there between your thought and Napoleon? —It may be, for 
example, that the word “Napoleon” occurs in the expression of my 
thought, plus the connection that word had with its bearer; e.g. 
that was the way he signed his name, that was how he was spoken 
to and so on. 

“But when you utter the word ‘Napoleon’ you designate that 
man and no other” — “How then does this act of designating work, 
in your view ? Is it instantaneous ? Or does it take time 2” ~ “But 
after all if someone asks you ‘did you mean the very man who won 
the battle of Austerlitz’ you will say ‘yes’. So you meant that man 
when you uttered the sentence.” —- Yes, but only in the kind of way that 
I then knew also that 6 x 6 = 36. 

The answer “I meant the victor of Austerlitz” is a new step in 
our calculus. The past tense is deceptive, because it looks as if it 
was giving a description of what went on “inside me” while I 
was uttering the sentence. 


(“But I meant him’. A strange process, this meaning! Can you 
mean in Europe someone who’s in America ? Even if he no longer 
exists ?) 


63 Misled by our grammar, we are tempted to ask “How does one 
think a proposition, how does one expect such and such to happen ? 
(how does one do that ?)” 


103 


“How does thought work, how does it use its expression?” — 
This question looks like “How does a Jacquard loom work, how 
does it use the cards”. 


In the proposition “I believe that p is the case ” we feel that the 
essential thing, the real process of belief, isn’t expressed but only 
hinted at; we feel it must be possible to replace this hint by a 
description of the mechanism of belief, a description in which the 
series of words “‘p” would occur as the cards occur in the descrip- 
tion of the loom. This description, we feel, would be at last the full 
expression of the thought. 

Let’s compare belief with the utterance of a sentence; there too 
very complicated processes take place in the larynx, the speech 
muscles, the nerves, etc. These ate accompaniments of the spoken 
sentence. And the sentence itself remains the only thing that 
interests us — not as part of a mechanism, but as part of a calculus. 


“How does thought manage to represent ?” — the answer might 
be “Don’t you really know ? You certainly see it when you think.” 
For nothing is concealed. 

How does a sentence do it ? Nothing is hidden. 


But given this answer “But you know how sentences do it, for 
nothing is concealed” one would like to say “yes, but it all goes by 
so quick, and I should like to see it as it were laid open to view”. 


We feel that thoughts are like a landscape that we have seen and 
are supposed to describe, but don’t remember exactly enough to 
describe how all the parts fitted together. Similarly, we think, we 
can’t describe thought after the event because then the many 
delicate processes have been lost sight of. We would like as it were 
to see these intricacies under the magnifying glass. (Think of the 
proposition “Everything is in flux’’.) 


104 


Weask: “What is a thought ? What kind of thing must something 
be to perform the function of thought?” This question is like: 
“What is a sewing machine, how does it work ? — And the answer 
which would be like ours would be “Look at the stitch it is meant 
to sew; you can see from that what is essential in the machine, 
everything else is optional.” 

So what is the function, that makes thought what it is ? — 

If it is its effect, then we are not interested in it. 

We are not in the realm of causal explanations, and every such 
explanation sounds trivial for our purposes. 


64 If one thinks of thought as something specifically human and 
organic, one is inclined to ask “could there be a prosthetic appara- 
tus for thinking, an inorganic substitute for thought?” But if 
thinking consists only in writing or speaking, why shouldn’t a 
machine do it? “Yes, but the machine doesn’t know anything.” 
Certainly it is senseless to talk of a prosthetic substitute for seeing 
and hearing. We do talk of artificial feet, but not of artificial pains 
in the foot. 


“But could a machine think ?” — Could it be in pain? — Here the 
important thing is what one means by something being in pain. I 
can look on another person — another person’s body — as a machine 
whichis in pain. And so, of course, I can in the case of my own body. 
On the other hand, the phenomenon of pain which I describe when 
I say something like “I have toothache” doesn’t presuppose a 
physical body. (I can have toothache without teeth.) And in this 
case there is no room for the machine. ~ It is clear that the machine 
can only replace a physical body. And in the sense in which we can 
say of such a body that it is in pain, we can say it of a machine as 
well. Or again, what we can compare with machines and call 
machines is the bodies we say are in pain. 


105 


In the consideration of our problems one of the most dangerous 
ideas is the idea that we think 7th, or in, our heads. 

The idea of a process in the head, in a completely enclosed space, 
makes thinking something occult.' 

“Thinking takes place in the head” really means only “the head 
is connected with thinking’’. - Of course one says also “I think 
with my pen” and this localisation is at least as good. 

It is a travesty of the truth to say “Thinking is an activity of our 
mind, as writing is an activity of the hand”. (Love in the heart. 
The head and the heart as loci of the soul). 


65 We may say “Thinking is operating with symbols”. But 
‘thinking’ is a fluid concept, and what ‘operating with symbols’ 
is must be looked at separately in each individual case. 

I might also say “Thinking is operating with language” but 
‘language’ is a fluid concept. 


It is correct to say “Thinking is a mental process” only if we 
also call seeing a written sentence or hearing a spoken one a mental 
process. In the sense, that is, in which pain is called a mental state. 
In that case the expression “mental process”’ is intended to dis- 
tinguish ‘experience’ from ‘physical processes’.—- On the other 
hand, of course, the expression “mental process” suggests that we 
are concerned with imperfectly understood processes in an in- 
accessible sphere. 

Psychology too talks of ‘unconscious thought’ and here 
“thought”? means a process in a mind-model. (“Model’ in the 
sense in which one speaks of a mechanical model of electrical 
processes). 

By contrast, when Frege speaks of the thought a sentence 
expresses the word “thought” is more or less equivalent to the 
expression “sense of the sentence”.

that gives it its meaning, its life. 


Though we speak of a thought and its expression, the thought is 
not a kind of condition that the sentence produces as a potion

or “thought-reading”’ ?) 


66 A French politician once said it was a special characteristic of 
the French language that in French sentences words occurred in 
the sequence in which one thinks them. 

The idea that one language in contrast to others has a word order 
which corresponds to the order of thinking arises from the notion 
that thought is an essentially different process going on inde- 
pendently of the expression of the thoughts. 

(No one would ask whether the written multiplication of two 
numbers in the decimal system runs parallel with the thought of the 
multiplication.)

“T thought only what I said.” 

(It perplexes us that there is no moment at which the thought of a 
sentence is completely present. Here we see that we are comparing 
the thought with a thing that we manufacture and possess as a 
whole; but in fact as soon as one part comes into being another 
disappears. This leaves us in some way unsatisfied, since we are 
misled by a plausible simile into expecting something different.)

Thought can only be something common-or-garden and 
ordinary. (We are accustomed to thinking of it as something 
ethereal and unexplored, as if we were dealing with something 
whose exterior alone is known to us, and whose interior is yet 
unknown like our brain.) One is inclined to say: ‘Thought, 
what a strange thing!’ But when I say that thought is something 
quite common-or-garden, I mean that we are affected by this 
concept as we are by a concept like that of the number one. There 
seems to be something mysterious about it, because we mis- 
understand its grammar and feel the lack of a tangible substance 


108 


to correspond to the substantive. (It is almost like hearing a 
human voice coming from in front of us, and seeing nobody there.) 


67 What does man think for? What use is it ? Why does he ca/cn- 
Jate the thickness of the walls of a boiler and not leave it to chance or 
whim to decide ? After all it is a mere fact of experience that boilers 
do, not explode so often if made according to calculations. But 
just as having once been burnt he would do anything rather than 
put his hand into the fire, so he would do anything rather than not 
calculate for a boiler. — Since we are not interested in causes, we 
might say: human beings do in fact think: this, for instance, is 
how they proceed when they make a boiler. - Now, can’t a boiler 
produced in this way explode? Certainly it can. 


We think over our actions before we do them. We make pictures 
of them — but why? After all, there is no such thing as a “‘thought- 
experiment”’. 

We expect something, and act in accordance with the expecta- 
tion; must the expectation come true? No. Then why do we act 
in accordance with the expectation ? Because we are impelled to, as 
we are impelled to get out of the way of a car, to sit down when we 
are tired, to jump up if we have sat on a thorn. 


What the thought of the uniformity of nature amounts to can 
perhaps be seen most clearly when we fear the event we expect. 
Nothing could induce me to put my hand into a flame —- although 
after all it is only in the past that I have burnt myself. 

The belief that fire will burn me is of the same nature as the fear 
that it will burn me. 

Here I see also what “‘it is certain’? means. 


If someone pushed me into the fire, I would struggle and go on 


109g 


resisting ; and similarly I would cry out “it will burn me!” and not 
“perhaps it will be quite agreeable”’. 


phrase which masks the beginning of the chain of reasons. (The 
creator as the explanation at the beginning of the world).! 


“But after all you do believe that more boilers would explode if 
people did not calculate when making boilers!” Yes, I believe it; 
— but what does that mean? Does it follow that there will in fact 
be fewer explosions ? — Then what is the foundation of this belief? 


68 I assume that his house in which I am writing won’t collapse 
during the next half hour. - When do I assume this? The whole 
time? And what sort of an activity is this assuming ? 

Perhaps what is meant is a psychological disposition; or perhaps 
the thinking and expressing of particular thoughts. In the second 
case perhaps I utter a sentence which is part of a train of thought 
(a calculation). Now someone says: you must surely have a reason 
to assume that, otherwise the assumption is unsupported and 
worthless. (Remember that we stand on the earth, but the 
earth doesn’t stand on anything else; children think it’ll have to 
fallif it’s not supported). Well, I dohave reasons for my assumption. 
Perhaps that the house has already stood for years, but not so 
long that it may already be rickety, etc. etc. - What counts as a 
reason for an assumption can be given a priori and determines a 
calculus, a system of transitions. But if we are asked now for a 
reason for the calculus itself, we see that there is none. 

So is the calculus something we adopt arbitrarily ? No more so 
than the fear of fire, or the fear of a raging man coming at us. 

“Surely the rules of grammar by which we act and operate are 
not arbitrary!’ Very well; why then does a man think in the way 
he does, why does he go through these activities of thought? 
(This question of course asks for reasons, not for causes.) Well, 
reasons can be given within the calculus, and at the very end one is 
tempted to say “‘it just is very probable, that things will behave in 
this case as they always have” — or something similar. A turn of 


The thing that’s so difficult to understand can be expressed like 
this. As ong as we temain in the province of the true-false games 
a change in the grammar can only lead us from ove such game to 
another, and never from something true to something false. On 
the other hand if we go outside the province of these games, we 
don’t any longer call it ‘language’ and ‘grammar’, and once 
again we don’t come into contradiction with reality.

69 What is a proposition ? - What am I distinguishing a proposi- 
tion from? What do I want to distinguish it from? From things 
which are only parts of propositions in the same grammatical 
system (like the parts of an equation)? Or from everything we 
don’t call propositions, including this chair and my watch, etc. etc? 


The question “how is the general concept of proposition 
bounded 2” must be countered with another: “Well, do we have a 
single concept of proposition ?” 

“But surely I havea definite concept of what I mean by ‘proposi- 
tion’.” Well, and how would I explain it to another ot to myself? 
This explanation will make clear what my concept is (I am not 
concerned with a feeling accompanying the word ‘proposition’). 
I would explain the concept by means of examples.—So my 
concept goes as far as the examples. - But after all they’re only 
examples, and their range is capable of extension. — All right, but 
in that case you must tell me what “capable of extension” means 
here. The grammar of this word must have definite boundaries. 


“But I know a proposition when I see one, so I must also be 
able to draw the boundaries of the concept precisely.” But is it 
really the case that no doubt is possible ? — Imagine a language in 
which all sentences are commands to go in a particular direction. 
(This language might be used by a primitive kind of human beings 
exclusively in war. Remember how restricted the use of written lan- 
guage once was.) Well, we would still call the commands “come 
here’’, “‘go there”, ‘“‘sentences”.'! But suppose now the language 
consisted only in pointing the finger in one direction or the other. — 
Would this sign still be a proposition? - And what about a 
language like the early speech of children whose signs expressed 
only desire for particular objects, a language which consisted 
simply of signs for these objects (of nouns, as it were) ? Or consider 


1. The same German word corresponds to “sentence” as to “proposition” 


(Tr.) 


Itz 


a system consisting of two signs, one expressing acceptance and 
the other rejection of proferred objects. Is this a language, does it 
consist of propositions ? 

And on the other hand: does everything that sounds like a 
sentence in English fall under our concept of proposition ? “I am 


22 ¢e 


tired”, “2 x 2= 4”, “time passes”, “there is only one zero”? 
> > 


o> 6¢ 


The word “proposition” does not signify a sharply bounded 
concept. If we want to put a concept with sharp boundaries beside 
our use of this word, we are free to define it, just as we are free to 
narrow down the meaning of the primitive measure of length “a 
pace” to 75 cm. 


zo “What happens when a zew proposition is taken into the lan- 
guage: what is the criterion for its being a proposition?” Let us 
imagine such a case. We become aquainted with a new experience, 
say the tingling of an electric shock, and we say it’s unpleasant. 
What right have I to call this newly formed statement a “‘proposi- 
tion” ? Well, what right did I have to speak of a new “experience”, 
ot a new “muscular sensation” ? Surely I did so by analogy with 
my earlier use of these words. But, on the other hand, did I save to 
use the word “experience” and the word “proposition” in the 
new case? Do I already assert something about the sensation of 
the electric shock when I call it an experience ? And what difference 
would it make if I excluded the statement “‘the tingling is un- 
pleasant”’ifrom the concept of proposition, because I had already 
drawn its boundaries once and for all ? 


Compate the concept of proposition with the concept ‘number’ 
and then with the concept of cardinal number. We count as 
numbers cardinal numbers, rational numbers, irrational numbers, 
complex numbers; whether we call other constructions numbers 
because of their similarities with these, or draw a definitive 
boundary here or elsewhere, depends on us. In this respect the 
concept of number is like the concept of proposition. On the 


113 


other hand the concept of cardinal number [1, &, & + 1] can be 
called a rigorously circumscribed concept, that’s to say it’s a 
concept in a different sense of the word. 


71 How did I come by the concept ‘proposition’ or the concept 
‘language’? Only through the languages I’ve learnt. - But in 
a certain sense they seem to have led me beyond themselves, since 
I’m now able to construct a new language, for instance to invent 
words. ~ So this construction too belongs to the concept of 
language. But only if I so stipulate. The sense of my “etc.” is 
constantly given limits by its grammar. 


That’s also what I meant when I said “there are surprises in 
reality but not in grammar.” 


“But language can expand” - Certainly; but if this word 
“expand” has a sense here, then I know a/ready what I mean by it. 
I must be able to specify how I imagine such an expansion. And 
what I can’t think, I can’t now express or even hint at. And in this 
case the word “now” means: “‘in this calculus” or “if the words 
are used according to these grammatical rules”. 

But here we also have this nagging problem: how is it possible 
even to think of the existence of things when we always see only 
images, copies of them? — We ask: “Then how did I come by this 
concept at all>?” It would be quite correct to add in thought the 
rider: “It is not as if I was able to transcend my own thought”’, “It 
is not as if I could sensibly transcend what has sense for me.”” We 
feel that there is no way of smuggling in by the back door a 
thought I am barred from thinking directly. 


No sign leads us beyond itself, and no argument either. 


114 


What does a man do when he constructs (invents) a new lan- 
guage; on what principle does he operate ? For this principle is the 
concept of ‘language’. Does every newly constructed language 
broaden (alter) the concept of language ? — Consider its relationship 
to the earlier concept: that depends on how the earlier concept 
was established. — Think of the relation of complex numbers to 
the earlier concept of number; and again of the relation of a new 
multiplication to the general concept of the multiplication of 
cardinal numbers, when two particular (perhaps very large) 
cardinal numbers are written down for the first time and multiplied 
together. 


72 In logic one cannot employ generality in a void. If I determine 
the grammar of my generality, then there are no more surprises 
in logic. And if I do not determine it, then I am no longer in the 
realm of an exact grammar. 

That’s to say, the indeterminacy of generality is not a logical 
indeterminacy. Generality is a freedom of movement, not an 
indeterminacy of geometry. 


But if the general concept of language dissolves in this way, 
doesn’t philosophy dissolve as well ? No, for the task of philosophy 
is not to create a new, ideal language, but to clarify the use of our 
language, the existing language. Its aim is to remove particular 
misunderstandings; not to produce a real understanding for the 
first time. 


If a man points out that a word is used with several different 
meanings, or that a certain misleading picture comes to mind 
when we use a certain expression, if he sets out (tabulates) rules 
according to which certain words ate used, he hasn’t committed 
himself to giving an explanation (definition) of the words “rule”, 
“proposition”, “word”, etc. 

I’m allowed to use the word “rule” without first tabulating the 
rules for the use of the word. And those rules are not super-rules. 


115 


Philosophy is concerned with calculi in the same sense as it is 
concerned with thoughts, sentences and languages. But if it was 
really concerned with the concept of calculus, and thus with the 
concept of the calculus of all calculi, there would be such a thing as 
metaphilosophy. (But there is not. We might so present all that 
we have to say that this would appear as a leading principle.) 


73 How do we use the word “rule”, say when we are talking of 
games ? In contrast to what? — We say for instance “that follows 
from this rule’’, but in that case we could cite the rule in question 
and thus avoid the word “rule”. Or we speak of “all the rules of a 
game”’ and in that case either we’ve listed them (in which case we 
have a repetition of the first case) or we’re speaking of the rules as 
a group of expressions produced in a certain way from given 
basic rules, and then the word “rule” stands for the expression of 
those basic rules and operations. Or we say “‘this is a rule and that 
isn’t” — if the second, say, is only an individual word or a sentence 
which is incomplete by the standards of English grammar, or the 
illustration of a position of pieces in a game. (Or “No, according 
to the new convention that too is a rule’’). If we had to write down 
the list of rules of the game, something like that might be said and 
then it would mean “‘¢his belongs in it and shat doesn’t”. But this 
isn’t on the strength of a particular property, the property of being 
a tule, like the case when one wants to pack only apples in a box 
and says, “no, that shouldn’t go in there, that’s a pear’’. 

Yes, but there are many things we call games and many we don’t, 
many things we call rules and many we don’t! — But it’s never a 
question of drawing a boundary between everything we call 
games and everything else. For us games are the games of which 
we have heard, the games we can list, and perhaps some others 
newly devised by analogy; and if someone wrote a book on games, 
he wouldn’t really need to use the word “game” in the title of the 
book, he could use as a title a list of the names of the individual 
games. 


116 


If he’s asked ‘“‘but what’s common to all these things that makes 
you collect them together?” he might say: I can’t give it straight 
off — but surely you may see many analogies. Anyway the question 
seems to me idle, because proceeding by analogy, I can also come 
by imperceptible steps to things that no one in ordinary life would 
any longer call “games”. Hence I call games things on this list, and 
whatever is similar to these games up to a certain point that I don’t 
further specify. Moreover, I reserve the right to decide in every 
new case whether I will count something as a game or not. 


The case is the same with the concepts ‘rule’, ‘proposition’, 
‘language’, etc. It is only in special cases (i.e. not every time we 
use the word “‘rule”’) that it is a question of drawing a boundary 
between rules and what are not rules, and in all cases it is easy to 
give the distinguishing mark. We use the word “rule” in contrast 
to “word”, “projection” and some other words and these demarca- 
tions can be clearly drawn. On the other hand we commonly do 
not draw boundaries where we do not need them. (Just as in 
certain games a single line is drawn in the middle of the field to 
separate the sides, but the field is not otherwise bounded since it is 
unnecessary.) 

We are able to use the word “plant” in a way that gives rise to 
no misunderstanding, yet countless borderline cases can be con- 
structed in which no one has yet decided whether something still 
falls under the concept ‘plant’. Does this mean that the meaning 
of the word “‘plant”’ in all other cases is infected by uncertainty, so 
that it might be said we use the word without understanding it? 
Would a definition which bounded this concept on several sides 
make the meaning of the word clearer to us in a// sentences? 
Would we understand better all the sentences in which it occurs ? 


74 How did we learn to understand the word “plant”, then? 


Perhaps we learnt a definition of the concept, say in botany, but I 
leave out that of account since it only has a role in botany. Apart 


117 


from that, it is clear that we learnt the meaning of the word by 
example; and if we disregard hypothetical dispositions, these 
examples stand only for themselves. Hypotheses about learning 
and using language and causal connections don’t interest us. 
So we don’t assume that the examples produce something in the 
learner, that they set before his mind an essence, the meaning of 
the concept-word, the concept ‘plant’. If the examples should 
have an effect, say they produce a particular visual picture in the 
learner, the causal connection between the examples and this 
picture does not concern us, and for us they are merely coincidental. 
So we can perhaps disregard the examples altogether and look on 
the picture alone as a symbol of the concept; or the picture and the 
examples together. 

If someone says “we understand the word ‘chair’, since we 
know what is common to all chairs” — what does it mean to say we 
know that ? That we are ready to say it (like “we know that 6 x 6 is 
36”)? What is it that is common, then? Isn’t it only because we 
can apply the word “chair” that we say here we know what is 
common? Suppose I explained the word “red” by pointing to a 
red wall, a red book, and a red cloth and in accordance with this 
explanation someone produced a sample of the colour red by 
exhibiting a red label. One might say in this case that he had 
shown that he had grasped the common element in all the examples 
I gave him. Isn’t it an analogy like this that misleads us in the case 
of “chair” P 


The grammatical place of the words “game”, “rule”, etc. is 
given by examples in rather the way in which the place of a meeting 
is specified by saying that it will take place beside such and such a 
tree. 


75 One imagines the meaning as something which comes before 
our minds when we hear a word. 

What comes before our minds when we hear a word is certainly 
something characteristic of the meaning. But what comes before 


118 


my mind is an example, an application of the word. And this coming 
to mind doesn’t really consist in a particular image’s being present 
whenever I utter or hear the word, but in fact that when I’m asked 
the meaning of the word, applications of the word occur to me. 


Someone says to me: “‘Shew the children a game” I teach them 
gaming with a dice, and the other says “I didn’t mean that sort of 
game’’. Must the exclusion of the game with dice have come before 
his mind when he gave me the order? 


Suppose someone said: “No. I didn’t mean that sort of game; 
I used ‘game’ in the narrower sense.” How does it come out, that 
he used the word in the narrower sense ? 


But can’t one also use the word “‘game’”’ in its broadest sense? 
But which is that ? No boundaries have been drawn unless we fix 
some on purpose. 

If we founda sentence like “The Assyrians knew various games” 
in a history book without further qualifications, it would strike us 
as very curious; for we wouldn’t be certain that we could give an 
example that even roughly corresponded to the meaning of the 
word “game” in this case. 


Someone wants to include in the list of rules of a game the 
proposition that the game was invented in such and such a year. 
I say ‘“‘No, that doesn’t belong to the list of rules, that’s nota rule.” 
So Pm excluding historical propositions from the rules. And 
similarly I would exclude from the rules, as an empirical proposi- 
tion, a proposition like “this game can only be learnt by long 
practice”. But it could easily be misleading to say boundaries had 
thereby been drawn around the area of rules. 


76 If I try to make clear to someone by characteristic examples 


119 


it 
t 
4 
i 


the use of a word like “wish”, it is quite likely that the other will 
adduce as an objection to the examples I offered another one that 
suggests a different type of use. My answer then is that the new 
example may be useful in discussion, but isn’t an objection to my 
examples. For I didn’t want to say that those examples gave the 
essence of what one calls “wishing’’. At most they present different 
essences which are all signified by this word because of certain 
inter-relationships. The error is to suppose that we wanted the 
examples to illustrate the essence of wishing, and that the counter 
examples showed that this essence hadn’t yet been correctly 
grasped. That is, as if our aim were to give a theory of wishing, 
which would have to explain every single case of wishing. 

But for this reason, the examples given are only useful if they 
are clearly worked out and not just vaguely hinted at. 


The use of the words “proposition”, “language”’, etc. has the 
haziness of the normal use of concept-words in our language. To 
think this makes them unusable, or ill-adapted to their purpose, 
would be like wanting to say “the warmth this stove gives is no 
use, because you can’t feel where it begins and where it ends”. 

If I wish to draw sharp boundaries to clear up or avoid mis- 
understandings in the area of a particular use of language, these 
will be related to the fluctuating boundaries of the natural use of 
language in the same way as sharp contours in a pen-and-ink 
sketch are related to the gradual transitions between patches of 
colour in the reality depicted. 


Socrates pulls up the pupil who when asked what knowledge is 
enumerates cases of knowledge. And Socrates doesn’t regard that 
as even a preliminary step to answering the question. 

But our answer consists in giving such an emuneration and a 


120 


few analogies. (In a certain sense we are always making things 
easier and easier for ourselves in philosophy.) 


77 The philosophy of logic speaks of sentences and words in 
exactly the sense in which we speak of them in ordinary life when 
we say “Here is a Chinese sentence”’, or “No, that only looks like 
writing; it is actually just an ornament” and so on. 

We are talking about the spatial and temporal phenomenon of 
language, not about some non-spatial, non-temporal phantasm. 
But we talk about it as we do about the pieces in chess when we are 
stating the rules of the game, not describing their physical 
properties. 

The question “what is a word >” is analogous to “What is a piece 
in chess (say the king) ?” 


In reflecting on language and meaning we can easily get into a 
position where we think that in philosophy we are not talking of 
words and sentences in a quite common-or-garden sense, but in a 
sublimated and abstract sense. — As if a particular proposition 
wasn’t really the thing that some person utters, but an ideal entity 
(the “class of all synonymous sentences” or the like), But is the 
chess king that the rules of chess deal with such an ideal and 
abstract entity too? 

(We are not justified in having any more scruples about our 
language than the chess player has about chess, namely none.) 


Again, we cannot achieve any greater generality in philosophy 
than in what we say in life and in science. Here too (as in mathe- 
matics) we leave everything as it is. 


When I talk about language (words, sentences, etc.) I must 
speak the language of every day. Is this language somehow too 
coarse and material for what we want to say ? Then how is another 
one to be constructed ? — And how strange that we should be able 
to do anything at all with the one we have! 


121 


In giving philosophical explanations about language I already 
have to use language full-blown (not some sort of preparatory, 
provisional one); this by itself shows that I can adduce only exterior 
facts about language. 

“Yes, but then how can these explanations satisfy us?” — Well, 
your very questions were framed in this language! —- And your 
scruples are misunderstandings. Your questions refer to words, 
so I have to talk about words. 

You say: the point isn’t the word, but its meaning, and you 
think of the meaning as a thing of the same kind as the word, 
though also different from the word. Here the word, there the 
meaning. The money, and the cow that you can buy with it. (But 
contrast: money, and its use). 


78 If we ask about the general form of proposition — bear in mind 
that in normal language sentences have a particular rhythm and 
sound but we don’t call everything ‘that sounds like a sentence’ 
a sentence. — Hence we speak also of significant and non-significant 
“sentences”. 

On the other hand, sounding like a sentence in this way isn’t 
essential to what we call a proposition in logic. The expression 
“sugar good” doesn’t sound like an English sentence, but it may 
very well replace the proposition “sugar tastes good”. And not 
e.g. in such a way that we should have to add in thought something 
that is missing. (Rather, all that matters is the system of expressions 
to which the expression “sugar good” belongs.) 

So the question arises whether if we disregard this misleading 
business of sounding like a sentence we still have a general concept 
of proposition. 


Imagine the English language altered in such a way that the 
order of the words in a sentence is the reverse of the present one. 
The result would be the series of words which we get if we read 
sentences of an English book from right to left. It’s clear that the 
multiplicity of possible ways of expression in this language must 
be exactly the same as in English; but if a longish sentence were 
read thus we could understand it only with great difficulty and we'd 


122 


perhaps never learn “to think in this language”. (The example of 
such a language can make clear a lot about the nature of what we call 
“thought’’.) 


79 The definition ‘‘A proposition is whatever can be true or false” 
fixes the concept of proposition in a particular language system as 
what in that system can be an argument of a truth-function. 

And if we speak of what makes a proposition a proposition, we 
are inclined to mean the truth-functions. 

“A proposition is whatever can be true or false” means the same 
as “‘a proposition is whatever can be denied”’. 


““p” is true = p 
669? 


p’ is false = ~p 
What he says is true = Things are as he says. 


One might say: the words “true” and “false” are only items in 
a particular notation for truth-functions. 

So is it correct to write “ ‘p’ is true’’, “ ‘p’ 1s false’; mustn’t it 
be “‘p is true” (or false)? The ink mark is after all not ¢rve; in the 
way in which it’s black and curved. 


66 6D 


" Does p’ is true”’ state anything about the sign “p”’ then? 

Yes, it says that ‘p’ agrees with reality.” Instead of a sentence of 
our word language consider a drawing that can be compared with 
reality according to exact projection-rules. This surely must show 
as clearly as possible what “‘ ‘p’ is true” states about the picture “‘p”’. 
The proposition “‘p’ is true’? can thus be compared with the 
proposition “this object is as long as this metre rule” and “p” to 
the proposition “this object is one metre long”. But the comparison 
is incorrect, because “this metre rule” is a description, whereas 
“metre rule”’ is the determination of a concept. On the other hand 
in “ “p’ is true” the ruler enters immediately into the proposition. 
“p” represents here simply the length and not the metre rule. For 


the representing drawing is also not ‘true’ except in accordance 


123 


with a particular method of projection which makes the ruler a 
purely geometrical appendage of the measured line. 


66 CL? 


It can also be put thus: The proposition “ ‘p’ is true” can only 


6699 


be understood if one understands the grammar of the sign “p” as 
a propositional sign; not if “‘p” is simply the name of the shape of a 
particular ink mark. In the end one can say that the quotation marks 


in the sentence “‘ ‘p’ is true” are simply superfluous. 


If one explains: “(x).fx’’ is true, if “f( )” gives true sentences 
for all substitutions - we must reflect that the sentence “(x).fx” 
follows from the proposition ‘‘‘f()’ gives true sentences for all 
substitutions”’, and vice versa. So the two propositions say the same. 

So that explanation does not assemble the mechanism of 
generality from its parts. 


One can’t of course say that a proposition is whatever one can 
predicate “true” or “false” of, as if one could put symbols together 
with the words “true” and “false” by way of experiment to see 
whether the result makes sense. For something could only be 
decided by this experiment if “true” and “false” already have 
definite meanings, and they can only have that if the contexts in 
which they can occur are already settled. - (Think also of identi- 
fying parts of speech by questions. “Who or what... ?”) 


80 In the schema “This is how things stand’’ the “chow things 
stand” is really a handle for the truth-functions. 

“Things stand”, then, is an expression from a notation for 
truth-functions. An expression which shows us what part of 
grammar comes into play here. 


If I let “that is how things stand” count as the general form of 
proposition, then I must count “2 +2= 4” as a proposition. 
Further rules are needed if we are to exclude the propositions of 
arithmetic.

Can one give the general form of a proposition? - Why not? In 
the same way as one might give the general form of a number, for 
example by the sign “|o, €, € +1|”. 1 am free to restrict the name 
“number” to that, and in the same way I can give an analogous 
formula for the construction of propositions or laws and use the 
word “proposition” or “law” as equivalent to that formula. — If 
someone objects and says that this will only demarcate certain laws 
from others, I reply: of course you can’t draw a boundary if you’ve 
decided in advance not to recognize one. But of course the question 
remains: how do you use the word “proposition” ? In contrast to 
what? 


(“Can a proposition treat of all propositions, or all propositional 
functions ?”? What is meant by that? Are you thinking of a pro- 
position of logic? - What does the proof of such a proposition 
look like ?) 


A general propositional form determines a proposition as part 
of a calculus. 


81 Are the rules that say that such and such a combination of 
words yields no sense comparable to the stipulations in chess that 
the game does not allow two pieces to stand on the same square, 
for instance, or a piece to stand on a line between two squares ? 
Those propositions in their turn are like certain actions; like e.g. 
cutting a chess board out of a larger sheet of squared paper. They 
draw a boundary. 

So what does it mean to say “this combination of words has no 
sense”? One can say of a name (of a succession of sounds): “J 
haven’t given anyone this name”; and name-giving is a definite 
action (attaching a label). Think of the representation of an 
explorer’s route by a line drawn in each of the two hemispheres 
projected on the page: we may say that a bit of line going outside 
the circles on the page makes no sense in this projection. We might 
also express it thus: no stipulation has been made about it.

“Flow do I manage always to use a word significantly? Do I 
always look up the grammar ? No, the fact that I mean something, — 
what I mean prevents me from talking nonsense.” — But what do 
I mean ? — I would like to say: I speak of bits of an apple, but not 
bits of the colour red, because in connection with the words “‘bits 
of an apple’’, unlike the expression “bits of the colour red”, I can 
imagine something, picture something, want something. It would 
be more correct to say that I do imagine, picture, or want something 
in connection with the words “bits of an apple” but not in connect- 
tion with the expression “‘bits of the colour red”. 

But the expression “I’m cutting red into bits” can have a sense 
(e.g. the sense of the proposition “I’m cutting something red into 
bits’). - Suppose I asked: which word is it, which mistake, that 
makes the expression senseless? This shows that this expression, 
in spite of its senselessness, makes us think of a quite definite 
grammatical system. That’s why we also say “red can’t be cut into 
bits” and so give an answer; whereas one wouldn’t make any 
answer to a combination of words like “is has good”’. But if one is 
thinking ofa particular system, a language game plus its application, 
then what is meant by “ ‘I’m cutting red into bits’ is senseless” is 
first and foremost that this expression doesn’t belong to the 
particular game its appearance makes it seem to belong to. 


If we do give a sense to the set of words “I’m cutting red into 
bits” how do we do it ? ~ We can indeed turn it into quite different 
things; an empirical proposition, a proposition of arithmetic (like 
2-+2= 4), an unproved theorem of mathematics (like Goldbach’s 
conjecture), an exclamation, and other things. So I’ve a free 
choice: how is it bounded? That’s hard to say — by various types 
of utility, and by the expression’s formal similarity to certain 


primitive forms of proposition; and all these boundaries are 
blurred. 


“How do I know that the colour red can’t be cut into bits?” 
That isn’t a question either. 
I would like to say: “I must degin with the distinction between 


126 


sense and nonsense. Nothing is possible prior to that. I can’t give 
it a foundation.” 


82 Can one ask: “How must we make the grammatical rules for 
words if they are to give a sentence sense”? 

Isay, forinstance: There isn’ta book here, but there could be one; 
on the other hand it’s nonsensical to say that the colours green and 
red could be in a single place at the same time. But if what gives a 
proposition sense is its agreement with grammatical rules then let’s 
make just this rule, to permit the sentence “‘red and green are both 
at this point at the same time”. Very well; but that doesn’t fix the 
grammar of the expression. Further stipulations have yet to be made 
about how such a sentence is to be used; e.g. how it is to be 
verified. 


If a proposition is conceived as a picture of the state of affairs it 
describes and a proposition is said to show just how things stand 
if it’s true, and thus to show the possibility of the asserted state of 
affairs, still the most that the proposition can do is what a painting 
or telief does: and so it can at any rate not set forth what is just not 
the case. So it depends wholly on our grammar what will be called 
possible and what not, i.e. what that grammar permits. But surely 
that is arbitrary! Certainly; but the grammatical constructions we 
call empirical propositions (e.g. ones which describe a visible 
distribution of objects in space and could be replaced by a repre- 
sentational drawing) have a particular application, a particular use. 
And a construction may have a superficial resemblance to such an 
empirical proposition and play a somewhat similar role ina calculus 
without having an analogous application; and if it hasn’t we won’t 
be inclined to call it a proposition. 


“Possible”? here means the same as “‘conceivable”’; but “‘con- 


ceivable” may mean “capable of being painted”, “capable of 
being modelled”, “capable of being imagined”’; i.e. representable 


127 


ina particular system of propositions. What matters is the system. — 
For example someone asks: “is it conceivable that a row of trees 
might go on forever in the same direction without coming to an 
end ?” Why shouldn’t it be ‘conceivable’? After all it’s expressible 
in a grammatical system. But if so what’s the application of the 
proposition ? How is it verified ? What is the relation between its 
verification and the verification of a proposition like “this row of 
trees ends at the hundredth tree” ? That will tell us how much this 
conceivability is worth, so to speak. 
Chemically possible O—O—H 


O—H! 


“T haven’t ever in fact seen a black line gradually getting lighter 
until it was white, and then more reddish until it was red: but I 
know that it is possible, because I can imagine it.” The form of 
expression “I know that it is possible, because . . . ” is taken from 
cases like “I know that it is possible to unlock the door with this 
key, because I once did so”. So am I making shat sort of conjecture: 
that the colour transition will be possible since I can imagine it ? - 
Isn’t this rather the way it is: here “the colour transition is possible” 
has the same meaning as “I can imagine it ?”” What about shis: “The 
alphabet can be said aloud, because I can recite it in my mind”? 

“T can imagine the colour transition” isn’t an assertion here 
about a particular power of my own imagination, in the way that 
“T can lift this stone” is about the power of my own muscles. The 
sentence “I can imagine the transition”, like “this state of affairs 
can be drawn”, connects the linguistic representation with 
another form of representation; it is to be understood as a proposi- 
tion of grammar. 


83 It looks as if we could say: Word-language allows of senseless 
combination of words, but the language of imagining does not 


1. Cf. Philosophical Investigations § 521 (Ed.) 


128 


allow us to imagine anything senseless. Hence too the language of 
drawing doesn’t allow of senseless drawings. — But that isn’t how 
it is: for a drawing can be senseless in the same way as a proposition. 
Think of a blueprint from which a turner is to work; here it is very 
easy to represent an exact analogy with a senseless pseudo- 
proposition. Remember too the example of drawing a route on a 
projection of the globe. 


When one wants to show the senselessness of metaphysical 
turns of phrase, one often says “I couldn’t imagine the opposite of 
that”, or “What would it be like if it were otherwise ?”’ (When, for 
instance, someone has said that my images are private, that only I 
alone can know if I am feeling pain, etc.) Well, if I can’t imagine 
how it might be otherwise, I equally can’t imagine that it is so. For 
here “I can’t imagine” doesn’t indicate a lack of imaginative 
power. I can’t even ¢ry to imagine it; it makes no sense to say “I 
imagine it”. And that means, no connection has been made between 
this sentence and the method of representation by imagination (or 
by drawing). 

But why does one say “I can’t imagine how it could be otherwise” 
and not “I can’t imagine the thing itself” ? One regards the sense- 
less sentence (e.g. “this rod has a length’”’) as a tautology as opposed 
to a contradiction. One says as it were: ““Yes, it has a length; but 
how could it be otherwise; and why say so?” To the proposition 
“This tod has a length’ we respond not “Nonsense!” but “Of 
course!” We might also put it thus: when we hear the two proposi- 
tions, “This rod has a length”’ and its negation ‘“This rod has no 
length”, we take sides and favour the first sentence, instead of 
declaring them both nonsense. But this partiality is based on a 
confusion: we regard the first proposition as verified (and the 
second as falsified) by the fact “that the rod has a length of 4 
metres”. “After all, 4 metres is a length’? - but one forgets that 
this is a grammatical proposition. 


129 


It is often possible to show that a proposition is meant meta- 
physically by asking “Is what you affirm meant to be an empirical 
proposition ? Can you conceive (imagine) its being otherwise?” ~ 
Do you mean that substance has never yet been destroyed, or that 
it is inconceivable that it should be destroyed? Do you mean that 
experience shows that human beings always prefer the pleasant to 
the unpleasant ? 


How strange that one should be able to say that such and such a 
state of affairs is inconceivable! If we regard thought as essentially 
an accompaniment going with an expression, the words in the 
statement that specify the inconceivable state of affairs must be 
unaccompanied. So what sort of sense is it to have ? Unless it says 
these words are senseless. But it isn’t as it were their sense that is 
senseless ; they are excluded from our language like some arbitrary 
noise, and the reason for their explicit exclusion can only be that 
we are tempted to confuse them with a sentence of our language. 


84 The role of a sentence in the calculus is its sense. 

A method of measurement ~ of length, for example — has exactly 
the same relation to the correctness of a statement of length as the 
sense of a sentence has to its truth or falsehood. 


What does “discovering that an assertion doesn’t make sense”’ 
mean ? — and what does it mean to say: “If I mean something by it, 
surely it must make sense to say it” ? “If I mean something by it” — 
if I mean what by it ? - 

One wants to say: a significant sentence is one which one can 
not metely say, but also think. But that would be like saying: a 
significant picture is one that can not merely be drawn but also 
represented plastically. And saying this would make sense. But the 
thinking of a sentence is not an activity which one does from the 
words (like singing from a score). The following example shews 
this. 

Does it make sense to say ““The number of my friends is equal to 
a root of the equation x* + 2x — 3 = 0?” Here, one might think, 


we have a notation whose grammar doesn’t settle by itself whether 
a sentence makes sense or not, so that it wasn’t determined in 
advance. That is a fine example of what is meant by understanding 


a proposition. 

If the expression “the root of the equation ...”’ were a Russellian 
description, then the proposition “I have n apples and 2 + n= 6” 
would have a different sense from the proposition “I have 4 


apples”’. 


The sense of a proposition (or athought)isn’t anything spiritual ; 
it’s what is given as an answer to a request for an explanation of 
the sense. Or: one sense differs from another in the same way as 
the explanation of the one differs from the explanation of the 
other. So also: the sense of one proposition differs from the sense 
of another in the same way as the one proposition differs from 
the other. 

The sense of a proposition is not a soul. 


Itis only ina language that something is a proposition. To under- 
stand a proposition is to understand a language. 

A proposition is a sign in a system of signs. It is ome com- 
bination of signs among a number of possible ones, and as 
opposed to other possible ones. As it were ove position of an indi- 
cator as opposed to other possible ones. 


“Go in the direction the arrow points.” 

“Go a hundred times as far as the arrow is long.” 

“Go as many paces as I draw arrows.” 

“Draw a copy of this arrow.” 

“Come at the time shown by this arrow considered as the hour 
hand of a clock.” 

For all of these commands the same arrow might do. 

* in contrast to 7 is a different sign from f in contrast to ¢.

85 Symbols appear to be of their nature unsatisfied. 

Wishes, conjectures, beliefs, commands appear to be something 
unsatisfied, something in need of completion. Thus I would like to 
characterize my feeling of grasping a command as a feeling of 
an innervation. But the innervation in itself isn’t anything un- 
satisfied, it doesn’t leave anything open, or stand in need of com- 
pletion. 

And I want to say: “‘A wish is unsatisfied because it’s a wish for 
something; opinion is unsatisfied, because it’s the opinion that 
something is the case, something real, something outside the 
process of opining.” 


I would like to say: ‘“‘my expectation is so made that whatever 
y y exp 
happens has to accord with it or not”. 


The proposition seems set over us as a judge and we feel answer- 
able to it. — It seems to demand that reality be compared with it. 


I said that a proposition was laid against reality like a ruler. 
And a ruler ~ like all logical comparisons for a proposition — is 
itself in a particular case a propositional sign. Now one would like 
to say: “Put the ruler against a body: it does not say that the body 
is of such-and-such a length. Rather it is in itself dead and achieves 
nothing of what thought achieves.” It is as if we had imagined that 
the essential thing about a living being was the outward form. 
Then we made a lump of wood in that form, and were abashed to 
see the stupid block, which hasn’t even any similarity to life. 


86 I want to say: “if someone could see the process of expectation, 
he would necessarily be seeing what was expected.” — But that is the 
case: if you see the expression of an expectation you see what is 
being expected. And in what other way, in what other sense would 
it be possible to see it? 


132 


When we give an order, it can look as if the ultimate thing 
sought by the order had to remain unexpressed, as there is always 
a gulf between an order and its execution. Say I want someone to 
make a particular movement, say to raise his arm. To make it 
quite clear, I do the movement. This picture seems unambiguous 
till we ask: how does he know that he is to make that movement? — 
How does he know at all what use he is to make of the signs I give 
him, whatever they are ? Perhaps I shall now try to supplement the 
order by means of further signs, by pointing from myself to him, 
making encouraging gestures etc. Here it looks as if the order were 
beginning to stammer. 

Suppose I wanted to tell someone to square the number 4, and 
did so by means of the schema: 


Now I’m tempted to say that the question mark only hints at 
something it doesn’t express. 

As if the sign were precariously trying to produce understanding 
in us. But if we now understand it, by what token do we under- 
stand ? 


The appearance of the awkwardness of the sign in getting its 
meaning across, like a dumb person who uses all sorts of suggestive 
gestures — this disappears when we remember that the sign does 
its job only in a grammatical system. 

(In logic what is unnecessary is also useless.) 


87 In what sense can one call wishes as such, beliefs, expectations 
etc. ‘unsatisfied’? What is the prototype of nonsatisfaction from 
which we take our concept? Is it a hollow space? And would one 
call that unsatisfied ? Wouldn’t this be a metaphor too? Isn’t what 
we call nonsatisfaction a feeling — say hunger? 


133 


In a particular system of expressions we can describe an object 
by means of the words “‘satisfied” and “unsatisfied”. For example, 
if we lay it down that we call a hollow cylinder an “unsatisfied 
cylinder” and the solid cylinder that fills it its “satisfaction”. 


It seems as if the expectation and the fact satisfying the expecta- 
tion fitted together somehow. Now one would like to describe an 
expectation and a fact which fit together, so as to see what this 
agreement consists in. Here one thinks at once of the fitting of a 
solid into a corresponding hollow. But when one wants to describe 
these two one sees that, to the extent that they fit, a sing/e description 
holds for both. (On the other hand compare the meaning of: 
“These trousers don’t go with this jacket” !) 


Expectation is not related to its satisfaction in the same way as 
hunger is related to its satisfaction. I can describe the hunger, and 
describe what takes it away, and say that it takes it away. And it 
isn’t like this either: I have a wish for an apple, and so I will call 
‘an apple’ whatever takes away the wish. 


88 The strange thing is expressed in the fact that if this is the event 
I expected, it isn’t distinct from the one I expected. 

I say: “that’s just how I imagined it”; and someone says some- 
thing like ““That’s impossible, because the one was an image and 
the other isn’t. Did you take your image for reality >?” 


I see someone pointing a gun and say “I expect a report”. The 
shot is fired. — Well, that was what you expected, so did that bang 
somehow already exist in your expectation ? Or is it just that there 
is some other kind of agreement between your expectation and 
what occurred; that that noise was not contained in your expecta- 
tion and merely accidentally supervened when the expectation was 
being fulfilled ? But no, if the noise had not occurred, my expecta- 


134 


tion would not have been fulfilled; the noise fulfilled it; it was not 
an accompaniment of the fulfilment like a second guest accom- 
panying the one I expected. — Was the thing about the event that 
was not in the expectation too an accident, an extra provided by 
fate ? — But then what was of an extra? Did something of the shot 
already occur in my expectation? — Then what was extra? for 
wasn’t I expecting the whole shot ? 

“The report was not so loud as I had expected.” “Then was there 
a louder bang in your expectation ?”” 


“The red which you imagine is surely not the same (the same 
thing) as the red which you see in front of you; so how can you 
say that it is what you imagined ?” — But haven’t we an analogous 
case with the propositions “Here is a red patch” and “Here there 
isn’t a red patch” ? The word “red” occurs in both; so this word 
cannot indicate the presence of something red. The word “red” 
does its job only in the propositional context. Doesn’t the 
misunderstanding consist in taking the meaning of the word “red” 
as being the sense of a sentence saying that something is red ? 


The possibility of this misunderstanding is also contained in the 
ambiguity of expressions like “the colour red as the common 
element of two states of affairs’ - This may mean that in each 
something és red, has the colour red; or else that both propositions 
are about the colour red. 

What is common in the latter case is the harmony between reality 
and thought to which indeed a form of our language corresponds. 


89 If we say to someone “imagine the colour red” he is to imagine 
a patch or something that is red, not one that is green, since that is 
not red. 

(Could one define the word “red” by pointing to something 
that was not red? That would be as if one were supposed to explain 


135 


the word “‘modest”’ to someone whose English was weak, and one 
pointed to an arrogant man and said “That man is sot modest”. 
That it is ambiguous is no argument against such a method of 
definition. Any definition can be misunderstood. But it might well 
be asked: are we still to call this “definition” ? - For, of course, 
even if it has the same practical consequences, the same effect on 
the learner, it plays a different part in the calculus from what we 
ordinarily call “ostensive definition” of the word “‘red”’.) 


It would be odd to say: “A process looks different when it 
happens from when it doesn’t happen.” Or “‘a red patch looks 
different when it is there from when it isn’t there; but language 
abstracts from this difference, for it speaks of a red patch whether 
it is there or not.” 


Reality is not a property still missing in what is expected and 
which accedes to it when one’s expectation is fulfilled. — Nor is 
reality like the daylight that things need to acquire colour, when 
they are already there, as it were colourless, in the dark. 


“How do you know that you are expecting a red patch; that is, 
how do you know that a red patch is the fulfilment of your ex- 
pectation ?” But I might just as well ask: “how do you know that 
that 7s a red patch ?” 

How do you know that what you did really was to recite the 
alphabet in your head ? ~ But how do you know that what you are 
reciting aloud really zs the alphabet ? 

Of course that is the same question as “How do you know that 
what you call ‘red’ is really the same as what another calls ‘red’ ?” 
And in its metaphysical use the one question makes no more 
sense than the other. 


In these examples, I would like to say, you see how the words are 
really used. 


90 One might think: What a remarkable process willing must be, 


if I can now will the very thing I won’t be doing until five minutes 


hence! 
How can I expect the event, when it isn’t yet there at all? 


“Socrates: so if someone has an idea of what is not, he has an 
idea of nothing ? — Theaetetus: It seems so. Socrates: But surely if 
he has an idea of nothing, then he hasn’t any idea at all ? - Theae- 


tetus: That seems plain.’’! 
If we put the word “kill”, say, in place of “have an idea of” in 


this argument, then there is a rule for the use of this word: it 
makes no sense to say “I am killing something that does not exist”. 
I can imagine a stag that is not there, in this meadow, but not kill 
one that is not there. And “to imagine a stag in this meadow” 
means to imagine /haf a stag is there. But to kill a stag does not 
mean to kill shat . . . But if someone says “‘in order for me to be able 
to imagine a stag it must after all exist in some sense”, the answer 
is: no, it does not have to exist in any sense. And if it should be 
replied: “But the colour brown at any rate must exist, for me to be 
able to have an idea of it” - then we can say ‘the colour brown 
exists’ means nothing at all; except that it exists here or there as 
the colouring of an object, and that is not necessary in order for 
me to be able to imagine a brown stag. 


We say that the expression of expectation ‘describes’ the expected 
fact and think of an object or complex which makes its appearance 
as fulfilment of the expectation. — But it is not the expected thing 
that is the fulfilment, but rather: its coming about. 

The mistake is deeply rooted in our language: we say “I expect 
him” and “‘T expect his arrival”. 


It is difficult for us to shake off this comparison: a man makes 
his appearance — an event makes its appearance. As if an event 
even now stood in readiness before the door of reality and were 
then to make its appearance in reality — like coming into a room.

than the Greek original. T's.)

91 I can look for him when he is not there, but not hang him when 
he is not there. 


One might want to say: “But he must be somewhere there if I 
am looking for him.” - Then he must be somewhere there too if 
I don’t find him and even if he doesn’t exist at all. 


A search for a particular thing (e.g. my stick) is a particular 
kind of search, and differs from a search for something else because 
of what one does (says, thinks) while searching, not because of 
what one finds. 

Suppose while I am searching I carry with me a picture or an 
image — very well. If I say that the picture is a picture of what I am 
looking for, that merely tells the place of the picture in the process 
of searching. And if I find it and say “There it is! Tat’s what I was 
looking for” those words aren’t a kind of definition of the name of 
the object of the search (e.g. of the words “my stick”), a definition 
that couldn’t have been given until the object had been found. 


“You were looking for sim? You can’t even have known if he 
was there!” (Contrast looking for the trisection of the angle.) 


One may say of the bearer of a name that he does not exist; and 
of course that is not an activity, although one may compare it with 
one and say: he must be there all the same, if he does not exist. 
(And this has certainly already been written some time by a 
philosopher.) 


The idea that it takes finding to show what we were looking for, 
and fulfilment of a wish to show what we wanted, means one is 
judging the process like the symptoms of expectation or search in 
someone else. I see him uneasily pacing up and down his room; 
then someone comes in at the door and he relaxes and gives signs 
of satisfaction. And I say “obviously he was expecting this person.” 

The symptoms of expectation are not the expression of expecta- 
tion. 


One may have the feeling that in the sentence “I expect he is 
coming” one is using the words “he is coming” in a different 
sense from the one they have in the assertion “he is coming”’. But 
if it were so, how could I say that my expectation had been ful- 
filled? And the words “he is coming” mean the same in the ex- 
pression of expectation as in the description of its fulfilment, 
because if J wanted to explain the words “he’”’ and “is coming”’, say 
by means of ostensive definitions, the same definitions of these 
words wouid go for both sentences. 

But it might now be asked: what’s it like for him to come? 
— The door opens, someone walks in, and so on. — What’s it like 
for me to expect him to come? - I walk up and down the room, 
look at the clock now and then, and so on. But the one set of events 
has not the smallest similarity to the other! So how can one use the 
same words in describing them? What has become now of the 
hollow space and the corresponding solid? 

But perhaps I say as I walk up and down: “I expect he’ll come 
in.” Now there is a similarity somewhere. But of what kind?! 

But of course I might walk up and down in my room and look at 
the clock and so on without expecting him to come. I wouldn’t 
describe doing that by saying “I expect he is coming”. So what 
made it e.g. the expectation precisely of him ? 


I may indeed say: to walk restlessly up and down in my room, to 
look at the door, to listen for a noise is: to expect N. ~ That is 
simply a definition of the expression “to expect N”. Of course it 
isn’t a definition of the word “expect”, because it doesn’t explain 
what e.g. “to expect M” means. Well, we can take care of that; we 
say something like: to expect X means to act as described and to 
utter the name “X” while doing so. On this definition the person 
expected is the person whose name is uttered. Or I may give as a 
definition: to expect a person X is to do what I described in the 
second example, and to make a drawing of a person. In that case, 
the person expected is the bearer of the name X, the person who 
corresponds to the drawing. - That of course wouldn’t explain 


139 


what “to expect N to go” means, and I would have to give either an 
independent definition of that, or a general definition including 
going and coming. And even that wouldn’t explain say what “to 
expect a storm” means; etc. etc. 


What characterizes all these cases is, that the definition can be 
used to read off the object of the expectation from the expectant 
behaviour. It isn’t a later experience that decides what we are 
expecting. 

And I may say: itis in language that expectation and its fulfilment 
make contact. 


So in this case the behaviour of the expectant person is behaviour 
which can be translated in accordance with given rules into the 
proposition “He is expecting it to happen that p’. And so the 
simplest typical example to illustrate this use of the word “‘expect”’ 
is that the expectation of its happening that p should consist in the 
expectant person sayzng “I expect it to happen that p’’. Hence in so 
many cases it clarifies the grammatical situation to say: let us put 
the expression of expectation in place of the expectation, the 
expression of the thought in place of the thought. 


93 One can conceive expectation as expectant, preparatory 
behaviour. Expectation is like a player in a ball game holding his 
hands in the right position to catch the ball. The expectation of 
the player might consist in his holding out his hands in a particular 
way and looking at the ball. 


Some will perhaps want to say: “An expectation is a thought”. 
Obviously, that corresponds to one use of the word “expect”. 
And we need to remember that the process of thinking may be very 
various.' 

And if expectation is the thought “I am expecting it to happen 
that p” it is senseless to say that I won’t perhaps know unti! later 
what I expected. 


1, A line has dropped out of the translation of the corresponding passage 
in Zettel (§63).

Something analogous might be said of wishing, fear and hope. 
(Plato called hope “‘a speech’”’). 


But it is different if anger is called “‘a wish’’, say the body’s wish 
for food to satisfy it. For it is a hypothesis that just that will satisfy 
the wish; there’s room for conjecture and doubt on the topic. 

Similarly if what I call “expectation” is a feeling, say a feeling 
of disquiet or dissatisfaction. But of course these feelings are not 
thoughts in an amorphous form. 


The idea of thought as an unexplained process in the human 
mind makes it possible to imagine it turned into a persistent 
amorphous condition. 


If I say “ I have been expecting him all day”, “expect” here 
doesn’t mean a persistent condition including as ingredients the 
person expected and his atrival, in the way that a dough may 
contain flour, sugar and eggs mixed into a paste. What constitutes 
expectation is a series of actions, thoughts and feelings. 


94 When I expect someone, ~ what happens? I perhaps look at my 
calendar and see his name against today’s date and the note “‘5 
p.m.” I say to someone else “I can’t come to see you today, because 
I’m expecting N”. I make preparations to receive a guest. I 
wonder “Does N smoke ?’’, I remember having seen him smoke 
and put out cigarettes. Towards 5 p.m. I say to myself “Now he’ll 
come soon”’, and as I do so I imagine a man looking like N; then I 
imagine him coming into the room and my greeting him and 
calling him by his name. This and many other more or less similar 


trains of events are called “expecting N to come”’. 


1. Philebus, 40A. (The Greek word in the context means rather “‘a word”, 
“a proposition”. Tr.) 


141 


But perhaps I’m also prepared to say “I have been expecting N” 
in a case where the only thing that connects him with my expectant 
activity is for instance that on a particular day I prepare a meal for 
myself and one other person, and that N. has announced his 
intention of taking that meal with me. 


What does the process or state of wanting an apple consist in? 
Perhaps I experience hunger or thirst or both, and meanwhile 
imagine an apple, or remember that I enjoyed one yesterday; 
perhaps I say “I would like to eat an apple’’; perhaps I go and look 
in a cupboard where apples are normally kept. Perhaps all these 
states and activities are combined among themselves and with 
others. 


95 The same sort of thing must be said of intention. If a mechan- 
ism is meant to act as a brake, but for some reason does not slow 
down the motion of the machine, then the purpose of the mechan- 
ism cannot be found out immediately from it and from its effect. 
If you were to say “that is a brake, but it doesn’t work” you would 
be talking about intention. But now suppose that whenever the 
mechanism didn’t work as a brake a particular person became 
angry. Wouldn’t the intention of the mechanism now be expressed 
in its effect ? No, for now it could be said that the lever sometimes 
triggers the brake and sometimes triggers the anger. For how does 
it come out that the man is angry because the lever doesn’t operate the 
brake? “Being annoyed that the apparatus does not function” 
is itself something like “wishing that it did function in that way”. — 
Here we have the old problem, which we would like to express in 
the following way: “the thought that p is the case doesn’t pre- 
suppose that it is the case; yet on the other hand there must be 
something in the fact that is a presupposition even of having the 
thought (I can’t think that something is red, if the colour red does 
not exist)’’. It is the problem of the harmony between world and 
thought. — To this it may be replied that thoughts are in the same 


142 


space as the things that admit of doubt; they are laid against them 
in the same way as a ruler is laid against what is to be measured. 


What I really want to say is this: the wish that he should come 
is the wish that really 4e should really come. If a further explanation 
of this assurance is wanted, I would go on to say ‘‘and by ‘he’ I 
mean that man there, and by ‘come’ I mean doing this...” But 
these are just grammatical explanations, explanations which create 
language. 


It is 7” /anguage that it’s all done. 


“T couldn’t think that something is red if red didn’t exist.” 
What that proposition really means is the image of something red, 
or the existence of a red sample as part of our language. But of course 
one can’t say that our language /as /o contain such a sample; if it 
didn’t contain it, it would just be another, a different language. 
But one can say, and emphasize, that it does contain it. 


96 It’s beginning to look somehow as if intention could never be 
recognized as intention from outside; as if one must be doing the 
meaning of it oneself in order to understand it as meaning. That 
would amount to considering it not as a phenomenon or fact but 
as something intentional which has a direction given to it. What 
this direction is, we do not know; it is something which is absent 
from the phenomenon as such. 

Here, of course, our earlier problem returns, because the point 
is that one has to read off from a thought that it is the thought that 
suchand such is the case. If one can’t read it off (as one can’t read off 
the cause of a stomach-ache) then it is of no logical interest. 

My idea seems nonsensical if it is expressed like sis. It’s supposed 
to be possible to see what someone is thinking of by opening up 
his head. But how is that possible ? The objects he’s thinking about 
are certainly not in his head — any more than in his thoughts! 


143 


If we consider them ‘from outside’ we have to understand 
thoughts as thoughts, intentions as intentions and so on, without 
getting any information about something’s meaning. For it is with 
the phenomenon of thinking that meaning belongs. 


If a thought is observed there can be no further question of an 
understanding; for if the thought is seen it must be recognized 
as a thought with a certain content; it doesn’t need to be inter- 
preted! — That really is how it is; when we are thinking, there isn’t 


any interpretation going on. 


97 If I said “but that would mean considering intention as some- 
thing other than a phenomenon” that would make intention 
reminiscent of the will as conceived by Schopenhauer. Every 
phenomenon seems dead in comparison with the living thought. 


“Intention seen from outside” is connected with the question 
whether a machine could think. “Whatever phenomenon we saw, 
it couldn’t ever be intention; for that has to contain the very thing 
that is intended, and any phenomenon would be something com- 
plete in itself and unconcerned with anything outside itself, some- 
thing merely dead if considered by itself.” 

This is like when we say: “The will can’t be a phenomenon, for 
whatever phenomenon you take is something that simply happens, 
something we undergo, not something we do. The will isn’t 
something 1 see happen, it’s more like my being involved in my 
actions, my being my actions.” Look at your arm and move it and 
you will experience this very vividly: “You aren’t observing it 
moving itself, you aren’t having an experience ~ not just an ex- 
perience, anyway — you’re doing something.”’ You may tell yourself 
that you could also imagine exactly the same thing happening to 
your hand, but merely observed and not willed by you. But shut 
your eyes, and move your arm so that you have, among other 
things, a certain experience: now ask yourself whether you still can 

imagine that you were having the same experience but without 
willing it. 


144 


If someone wants to express the distinction between voluntary 
and involuntary movements by saying that voluntary movements 
of the arm, for example, are differentiated from involuntary ones 
by a feeling of innervation, you feel an urge to say “But I don’t 
undergo this experience, I do it — ” But can one speak of a distinction 
between undergoing and doing in the case of an experience of 
innervation? I would like to say: “If I will, then there isn’t any- 
thing that happens to me, neither the movement nor a feeling; 1am 
the agent.” Very well; but there’s no doubt that you a/so have 
experiences when you voluntarily move your arm; because you 
see(and feel) it moving whether or not you take up the attitude of an 
observer. So just for once try to distinguish between a// the experiences 
of acting plus the doing (which is not an experience) and a// those 
experiences without the element of doing. Think over whether you 
still need this element, or whether it is beginning to appear 
redundant. — Of course you can say correctly that when you do 
something, there isn’t anything happening to you, because the 
phenomena of doing ave different from the phenomena of observing 
something like a reflex movement. But this doesn’t become clear 
until one considers the very different sorts of things that people 
call voluntary activities and that people call unintentional or 
involuntary processes in our life. (More about this in another 
place.) 


98 By “intention” I mean here what uses a sign in a thought. 
The intention seems to interpret, to give the final interpretation; 
which is not a further sign or picture, but something else, the thing 
that cannot be further interpreted. But what we have reached is a 
psychological, not a logical terminus. 

Think of a sign language, an ‘abstract’ one, I mean one that is 
strange to us, in which we do not feel at home, in which, as we 
should say, we do not shink (we used a similar example once before), 
and let us imagine this language interpreted by a translation into — 
as we should like to say — an unambiguous picture-language, a 
language consisting of pictures painted in perspective. It is quite 


145 


clear that it is much easier to imagine different znterpretations of the 
written language than of a picture painted in the usual way de- 
picting say a room with normal furniture. Here we shall also be 
inclined to think that there is no further possibility of interpreta- 
tion. 


Here we might also say we didn’t enter into the sign-language, 
but did enter into the painted picture. 


(This is connected with the fact that what we call a ‘picture by 
similarity’ is not a picture in accordance with some established 
method of projection. In this case the “likeness” between two 
objects means something like the possibility of mistaking one for 
the other.) 


“Only the intended picture reaches up to reality like a yard- 
stick. Looked at from outside, there it is, lifeless and isolated.” — 
It is as if at first we looked at a picture so as to enter into it and the 
objects in it surrounded us like real ones; and then we stepped 
back, and were now outside it; we saw the frame, and the picture 
was a painted surface. In this way, when we intend, we are surroun- 
ded by our intention’s pictures and we are inside them. But when 
we step outside intention, they are mere patches on a canvas, with- 
out life and of no interest to us. When we intend, we exist among the 
pictures (shadows) of intention, as well as with real things. Let us 
imagine we are sitting in a darkened cinema and entering into the 
happenings in the film. Now the lights are turned on, though the 
film continues on the screen. But suddenly we see it “from out- 
side” as movements of light and dark patches on a screen. 


(In dreams it sometimes happens that we first read a story and 
then are ourselves participants in it. And after waking up after a 
dream it is sometimes as if we had stepped back out of the dream 
and now see it before us as an alien picture.) And it also means 
something to speak of “living in the pages of a book”. That is 


connected with the fact that our body is not at all essential for the 
occurrence of our experience. (Cf. eye and visual field.) 

(Compare also the remark: if we understand a sentence, it has a 
certain depth for us.) 


99 What happens is not that this symbol cannot be further 
interpreted, but: I do no interpreting. I do not interpret because 
I feel natural in the present picture. When I interpret, I step from 
one level of my thought to another. 


If I see the thought symbol “from outside”’, I become conscious 
that it cou/d be interpreted thus or thus; if it is a step in the course 
of my thoughts, then it is a stopping-place that is natural to me, 
and its further interpretability does not occupy (or trouble) me. 
As I have a railway time-table and use it without being concerned 
with the fact that a table can be interpreted in various ways. 


When I said that my image wouldn’t be a portrait unless it bore 
the name of its subject, I didn’t mean that I have to imagine it 
and his name at the same time. Suppose I say something like: 
“What I see in my mind isn’t just a picture which is like N (and 
perhaps like others too). No, I know that it is him, that he is the 
person it portrays.” I might then ask: when do I know that and 
what does knowing it amount to? There’s no need for anything 
to take place during the imagining that could be called ‘“‘knowing”’ 
in this way. Something of that sort may happen after the imagining ; 
I may go on from the picture to the name, or perhaps say that I 
imagined N, even though at the time of the imagining there 
wasn’t anything, except a kind of similarity, to characterize the 
image as N’s. Or again there might be something preceding the 
image that made the connection with N. And so the interpretation 
isn’t something that accompanies the image; what gives the image 
its interpretation is the path on which it lies. 

That all becomes clearer if one imagines images replaced by 


147 


drawings, if one imagines people who go in for drawing instead of 
imagining. 


100 If I try to describe the process of intention, I feel first and 
foremost that it can do what it is supposed to only by containing an 
extremely faithful picture of what it intends. But further, that that 
too does not go far enough, because a picture, whatever it may be, 
can be variously interpreted; hence this picture too in its turn 
stands isolated. When one has the picture in view by itself it is 
suddenly dead, and it is as if something had been taken away from 
it, which had given it life before. It is not a thought, not an inten- 
tion; whatever accompaniments we imagine for it, articulate or 
inarticulate processes, or any feeling whatsoever, it remains 
isolated, it does not point outside itself to a reality beyond. 

Now one says: “Of course it is not the picture that intends, but 
we who use it to intend.” But if this intending, this meaning, is 
something that is done with the picture, then I cannot see why that 
has to involve a human being. The process of digestion can also 
be studied as a chemical process, independently of whether it 
takes place in a living being. We want to say “Meaning is surely 
essentially a mental process, a process of consciousness and life, 
not of dead matter.” But what will give such a thing the specific 
character of what goes on? — so long as we speak of it as a process. 
And now it seems to us as if intending could not be any process at 
all, of any kind whatever. - For what we are dissatisfied with 
here is the grammar of process, not the specific kind of process. — 
It could be said: we should call any process ‘dead’ in this sense. 


Let’s say the wish for this table to be a little higher is the act of 
my holding my hand above the table at the height I wish it to be. 
Now comes the objection: “The hand above the table can’t be 
the wish: it doesn’t express that the table is to be higher; it is 


148 


where it is and the table is where it is. And whatever other gesture 
I made it wouldn’t make any difference.” 


(It might almost be said: “Meaning moves, whereas a process 
stands still.’”) 


1o1 However, if I imagine the expression of a wish as the act of 
wishing, the problem appears solved, because the system of 
language seems to provide me with a medium in which the 
proposition is no longer dead. 


If we imagine the expression of a wish as the wish, it is rather as 
if we were led by a train of thought to imagine something like a 
network of lines spread over the earth, and living beings who 
moved only along the lines. 


But now someone will say: even if the expression of the wish is 
the wish, still the whole language isn’t present during this ex- 
pression, yet surely the wish is! 

So how does language help? Well, it just isn’t necessary that 
anything should be present except the expression. 


102 You might as it were locate (look up) all of the connections in 
the grammar of the language. There you can see the whole net- 


’ work to which the sentence belongs. 


Suppose we’re asked “When we’re thinking, meaning and so on 
why don’t we come upon the bare picture ?”’ We must tell ourselves 
that when we’re thinking we don’t wonder whether the picture is 
the thought or the meaning, we simply ase pictures, sentences and 
so on and discard them one after the other. 


But of course if you call the picture the wish (e.g. that this table 
were higher) then what you’re doing is comparing the picture with 
an expression of our language, and certainly it doesn’t correspond 
to such an expression unless it’s part of a system translatable into 
our language. 


One says: how can this way of holding the hand, this picture 
149 


be the wish that such and such were the case? It is nothing more 
than a hand over a table, and there it is, alone and without a sense. 
Like a single bit of scenery from the production of a play which has 
been left by itself. It had life only in the play. 


In the gesture we don’t see the real shadow of the fulfilment, 
the unambiguous shadow that admits of no further interpretation. 


We ask: “does the hand above a table wish?” Does anything, 
spiritual or material, that we might add, wish? Is there any such 
situation or process that really contains what is wished? - And 
what is our paradigm of such containing? Isn’t it our language ? 
Where are we to find what makes the wish is wish, even though 
it’s only a wish? Nowhere but in the expressed wish. 


“After all, the wish must show what is wished, it must prefigure 
in the realm of wishes that which is wished.” But what actual 
process do you have in mind here as the prefiguring ? (What is the 
mirror in which you think you saw what was wished ?) 


“The gesture /ries to prefigure” one wants to say “but it can’t”’. 


103 Can one say that while I’m wishing my wish seems to prefigure 
the fulfilment ? While I’m wishing it doesn’t seem to do anything; 
I notice nothing odd about it. It’s only considering the linguistic 
manifestation of the wish that produces this appearance. 


We are considering an event that we might call an instance of 
the wish that this table were higher. But this event doesn’t even seem 
to contain the fulfilment. Now someone says: “But this event does 
have to be a shadow of the very state of affairs that is wished, and 


150 


these actions aren’t that.”” But why do you say that’s what a wish 
has to be? “‘Well, because it’s the wish that just that were the case’’. 
Precisely: that’s the only answer you can give to the question. 


So after all that event is the shadow, insofar as it corresponds 
within a system to the expression of the wish in the word-lan- 
guage. (It is in language that wish and fulfilment meet.) Remember 
that the expression of a wish can be the wish, and that the expression 
doesn’t derive its sense from the presence of some extraordinary 
spirit. 


Think also of a case very similar to the present one: ‘This 
table isn’t 80 cm high”. Must the fact that it is 90 cm, and so nor 
80 cm, high contain the shadow of the fact of its being 80 cm 
high? What gives this impression? When I see a table which is 
go cm high does it give a shadowy impression of having a height it 
doesn’t have? 

This is rather as if we misunderstood the assertion “hb ~ p” 
in such a way as to think that it contained the assertion “F p”, 
rather as “Fk p.q” contains in its sense “FF p”. 


Someone describes to me what went on when he, as he says, 
had the wish that the table were 10 cm higher. He says that he held 
his hand 10 cm above the table. I reply “But how do you know that 
you weren’t just wishing that the table were higher, since in that 
case too you would have held your hand at some height above the 
table.” He says “After all, I must know what I wished’ I reply 
“Very well, but I want to know by what token you remember when 
you remember your wish. What happened when you wished, and 
what makes you say you wished just that ?” He says “I know that I 
intentionally held my hand just 10 cm above.”’ I say “But what 
constituted just ‘hat intention?” —I might also ask “Is it certain 
that when you were wishing you were using the scale 1:1? How 
do you know that ?” 

If he had described the process of wishing by saying “I said 
‘I would like to have the table 10 cm higher’”’, then the question 


how he could know what he wished wouldn’t have arisen. (Unless 
someone had gone on to ask: “And did you mean those words in 
the way they are usually meant ?’’.) 

What it always comes to in the end is that without any further 
meaning he calls what happened the wish that that should happen. 
[Manifestation, not description.] 


“How do I know it’s sim I’m remembering, if the remembering 

is a picture?” To what extent do I know it ? (“When two men look 
7 >> 

perfectly alike, how can I remember one of them in particular ?”’) 


104 We say “A proposition isn’t just a series of sounds, it is some- 
thing more”. We think of the way a Chinese sentence is a mete 
series of sounds for us, which just means that we don’t understand 
it, and we say this is because we don’t have any thoughts in con- 
nection with the Chinese sentence (e.g. the Chinese word for “red” 
doesn’t call up any image in us). “So what distinguishes a signifi- 
cant sentence from mere sounds is the thoughts it evokes.” The 
sentence is like a key-bit whose indentations are constructed to 
move levers in the soul in a particular way. The sentence, as it 
were, plays a melody (the thought) on the instrument of the soul. 
But why should I now hypothesize, in addition to the orderly 
seties of words, another series of mental elements running parallel ? 
That simply duplicates language with something else of the same 
kind. 


Suppose the sentence is: “This afternoon N went into the 
Senate House.” The sentence isn’t a mere noise for me, it evokes 
an image of a man in the vicinity of the Senate House, or something 
similar. But the sentence and the image aren’t just a noise plus a 
faint image; calling up the image, and having certain other con- 
sequences, is something as it were internal to the sentence; shat 
is what its sense is. The image seems only a faint copy of the sense, 
or shall we say, only a single view of the sense. - But what do I 
mean by this? Don’t I just see the sentence as part of a system of 
consequences ? 


152 


Let us suppose that proposition evoked in me a very clear 
picture of N on the way to the Senate House and that in the picture 
there could also be seen the setting sun (“evening”) and a calendar 
with today’s date. Suppose that instead of letting the sentence 
call up this picture, I actually painted it and showed it to someone 
else as a means of communication in place of the sentence. He 
might say of this too that it expressed a thought but needed to be 
understood; what he would think of as an act of understanding 
would probably be a translation into word languages. 


“I arrive in Vienna on the 24th of December.” They aren’t 
mere words! Of course not: when I read them various things 
happen inside me in addition to the perception of the words: 
maybe I feel joy, I have images, and so on. — But I don’t just mean 
that various more or less inessential concomitant phenomena 
occur in conjunction with the sentence; I mean that the sentense 
has a definite sense and I perceive it. But then what is this definite 
sense? Well, that this particular person, whom I know, arrives 
at such and such a place etc. Precisely: when you are giving the 
sense, you are moving around in the grammatical background of 
the sentence. You’re looking at the various transformations and 
consequences of the sentence as laid out in advance; and so they 
are, in so far as they are embodied in a grammar. (You are simply 
looking at the sentence as a move in a given game.) 


I said that it is the system of language that makes the sentence a 
thought and makes it a thought for us. 


That doesn’t mean that it is while we are using a sentence that the 
system of language makes it into a thought for us, because the 
system isn’t present then and there isn’t any need for anything to 
make the sentence alive for us, since the question of being alive 
doesn’t arise. But if we ask: “why doesn’t a sentence strike us as 
isolated and dead when we are teflecting on its essence, its sense, 


the thought etc.” it can be said that we ate continuing to move 
in the system of language. 


153 


To match the words “I grasp the sense” or “I am thinking the 
thought of this sentence” you hypothesize a process which unlike 
the bare propositional sign contains these consequences. 


105 “This queer thing, thought”: but it does not strike us as queer 
while we are thinking iz, It strikes us as queer when we tell our- 
selves that it connects objects in the mind, because it is the very 
thought that ¢his person is doing that; or that it isn’t a sign or a 
picture, because I would still have to know how they were meant 
in their turn; or that thought isn’t something dead, because for me 
what I think rea//y happens. 

What is the source of this odd way of looking at things ? 

What makes us think that a thought, or a proposition we think, 
contains the reality ? It’s that we’re all ready to pass from it to the 
reality, and we feel this transition as something already potentially 
contained in it (when, that is, we reflect on it), because we say “that 
word meant him’. We feel this transition as something just as 
legitimate as a permitted move in a game. 


Thought does not strike us as mysterious while we are thinking, 
but only when we say, as it were retrospectively: “How was that 
possible?” How was it possible for thought to deal with the very 
person himself? But here I am merely being astonished by my own 
linguistic expression and momentarily misunderstanding it. 


Thought strikes us as mysterious. But not while we think. And 
we don’t mean that it’s psychologically remarkable. It isn’t only 
that we see it as an extraordinary way of producing pictures and 
signs, we actually feel as if by means of it we had caught reality in 


our net. 


It isn’t while we’re /ooking at it that it seems a strange process; 
but when we let ourselves be guided by language, when we look 


at what we say about it. 
We mistakenly locate this mystery in the nature of the process. 


154 


(We interpret the enigma created by our misunderstanding as the 
enigma of an incomprehensible process.) 


106 “Thought is a remarkable process, because when I think of 
what will happen tomorrow, I am mentally already in the future.” 
If one doesn’t understand the grammar of the proposition “I am 
mentally in the future” one will believe that here the future is in 
some strange way caught in the sense of a sentence, in the meaning 
of words. Similarly people think that the endless series of cardinal 
numbers is somehow before our mind’s eye, whenever we can use 
that expression significantly. 


“For me this portrait is Aim’? ? What does that mean? I have the 
same attitude to the portrait, as to the man himself, For I do of 
course distinguish between him and his picture. 


A thought experiment comes to much the same as an experiment 
which is sketched or painted or described instead of being carried 
out. And so the result of a thought experiment is the fictitious 
result of a fictitious experiment. 


“The sense of this proposition was present to me.”” What was it 
that happened ? 


“Only someone who is convinced can say that”’. - How does the 
conviction help him when he says it ? — Is it somewhere at hand by 
the side of the spoken expression ? (Or is it masked by it, as a soft 
sound by a loud one, so that it can, as it were, no longer be heard 
when one expresses it out loud?) What if someone were to say 
“Tn order to be able to sing a tune from memory one has to hear it in 
one’s mind and sing from that” ? 


Try the following experiment: Say a sentence, perhaps “The 


weather is very fine today”’; right, and now think the thought of the 
sentence, but unadulterated, without the sentence.

107 “It looks as if intention could never be recognized as intention 
“from outside”, as if one must be doing the meaning of it oneself 


201 


in order to understand it as meaning. 


Can one recognize stomach-ache as such “from outside” ? What 
are stomach-aches “from outside”? Here there is no outside or 
inside! Of course, in so far as meaning is a specific experience, one 
wouldn’t call any other experience “meaning”. Only it isn’t any 
remarkable feature of the sensation which explains the direction- 
ality of meaning. And if we say “from outside intention cannot be 
recognised as intention etc.”” we don’t want to say that meaning is 
a special experience, but that it isn’t anything which happens, or 
happens to us, but something that we do, otherwise it would be 
just dead. (The subject — we want to say — does not here drop out 
of the experience but is so much involved in it that the experience 


cannot be described.) 


It is almost as if one said: we can’t see ourselves going hither and 
thither, because it is we who are doing the going (and so we can’t 
stand still and watch). But here, as so very often, we ate suffering 
from an inadequate form of expression, which we are using at the 
very time we want to shake it off. We clothe the protest against out 
form of expression in an apparently factual proposition expressed 
in that very form. For if we say “we see ourselves going thither” 
we mean simply that we see what someone sees when he is going 
himself and not what he sees if someone else is going. And one does 
indeed have a particular visual experience if one is doing the going 
oneself. 


That is to say, what we are speaking of is a case in which contrary 
to experience the subject is linked like an element in a chemical 
compound. But where do we get this idea from? The concept of 
living activity in contrast with dead phenomena. 


I. p. 143 above. 


156 


Imagine someone now saying: “going somewhere oneself isn’t 
an experience’’. 


We want to say: “When we mean something, there isn’t a dead 
picture (of any kind); it’s as if we went up to someone. We go up 
to what we mean.” 

But here we’re constructing a false contrast between experience 
and something else, as if experience consisted of sitting still and 
letting pictures pass in front of one. 


“When one means, it is oneself doing the meaning”’; similarly, 
it is oneself that does the moving. One rushes forward oneself, 
and one can’t simultaneously observe the rushing. Of course not. 


Yes, meaning something is like going up to someone. 


108 Fulfilment of expectation doesn’t consist in this: a third thing 
happens which can be described otherwise than as “the fulfilment 
of this expectation”, i.e. as a feeling of satisfaction or joy or what- 
ever it may be. The expectation that something will be the case is 
the same as the expectation of the fulfilment of that expectation. 
Could the justification of an action as fulfilment of an order run 
like this: “You said ‘bring me a yellow flower’, upon which this 
one gave mea feeling of satisfaction; that is why I have brought it” ? 
Wouldn’t one have to reply: “But I didn’t set you to bring me the 


flower which should give you that sort of feeling after what I 
said!” 


(I go to look for the yellow flower. Suppose that while I am 
looking a picture comes before my mind, ~ even so, do I need it 
when I see the yellow flower — or another flower? If I say: “as 
soon as I see a yellow flower, something as it were clicks into 
place in my memory”’ — rather like a lever into a cog in the striking 
mechanism of a clock — can I foresee, or expect, this clicking into 
place any better than the yellow flower ? Even if in a particular case 


157 


it really is true that what I’m expecting isn’t what I am looking for, 
but some other (indirect) criterion, that certainly isn’t an explana- 
tion of expectation.) 


But isn’t the occurrence of what is expected always accompanied 
by a phenomenon of agreement (or satisfaction ?). Is this pheno- 
menon something different from the occurrence of what is expec- 
ted ? If so, then I don’t know whether fulfilment is always accom- 
panied by such a phenomenon. 

If I say: the person whose expectation is fulfilled doesn’t have 
to shout out “yes, that is it’ or the like - I may be told: “Certainly, 
but he must 4”ow that the expectation is fulfilled.” Yes, if the 
knowledge is part of its being fulfilled. “Yes, but when someone 
has his expectation fulfilled, there’s always a relaxation of ten- 
sion!” — How do you know that? 


VIII 


tog A description of language must achieve the same result as 
language itself. “For in that case I really can learn from the propo- 
sition, from the description of reality, how things are in reality.” ~ 
Of course it’s only zis that is called description, or “learning how 
things are”. And that is all that is ever said when we say that we 
learn from the description how things are in reality. 

“From the order you get the knowledge of what you have to 
do. And yet the order only gives you itself, and its effect is neither 
here nor there.” But here we are simply misled by the form of 
expression of our language, when it says “the knowledge of what 
you have to do” or “the knowledge of the action”. For then it 
looks as if this something, the action, is a thing which is to come 
into existence when the order is carried out, and as if the order 
made us acquainted with this very thing by showing it us in such 
a way that it already in a certain sense brought it into existence. 
(How can a command — an expectation — show us a man before 
he has come into the room ?) 


Suppose someone says that one can infer from an order the action 
that obeys it, and from a proposition the fact which verifies it. 
What on earth can one infer from a proposition apart from itself? 
How can one pull the action out of the order before it takes place? 
Unless what is meant is a different form of description of the action, 
such as say making a drawing, in accordance with the order, of 
what I’m to do. But even this further description isn’t there until 
I have drawn it; it doesn’t have a shadowy existence in the order 
itself. 

Being able to do something seems like a shadow of the actual 
doing, just as the sense of a sentence seems like the shadow of a 
fact, and the understanding of an order the shadow of its execution. 


159 


In the order the fact as it were “casts its shadow before it”! But 


this shadow, whatever it may be, is not the event. 

The shadowy anticipation of the fact consists in our being able 
already to think that that very thing will happen, which hasn’t yer 
happened. Or, as it is misleadingly put, in our being now able to 
think of (or about) what hasn’t yet happened. 


110 Thinking plus its application proceeds step by step like a 
calculus. — However many intermediate steps I insert between the 
thought and its application, each intermediate step always follows 
the previous one without any intermediate link, and so too the 
application follows the last intermediate step. It is the same as 
when we want to insert intermediate links between decision and 
action. 


The ambiguity of our ways of expressing ourselves: If an order 
were given us in code with the key for translating in into English, 


we might call the procedure of constructing the English form of. 


the order “derivation of what we have to do from the code” or 
“derivation of what executing the order is”. If on the other hand 
we act according to the order, obey it, here too in certain cases one 
may speak of a derivation of the execution. 


We can’t cross the bridge to the execution until we are there. 


111 Itis asa calculus that thinking has an interest for us; not as an 
activity of the human imagination. 


It is the calculus of thought that connects with extra-mental 
reality. 


From expectation to fulfilment is a step in a calculation. Indeed, 
the relation between the calculation 
25 X 25 
—< 
125 


and its result 625 is exactly the same as that between expectation 


160 


and its fulfilment. Expectation is a picture of its fulfilment to 
exactly the same degree as this calculation is a picture of its result, 
and the fulfilment is determined by the expectation to exactly the 
same degree as the result is determined by the calculation. 


112 When I think in language, there aren’t meanings going 
through my mind in addition to the verbal expressions; the 
language is itself the vehicle of thought. 


In what sense does an order anticipate its execution ? By ordering 

just that which later on is carried out? But one would have to say 

“which later on is carried out, or again is not carried out”. And 
that is to say nothing. 

“But even if my wish does not determine what is going to be the 
case, still it does so to speak determine the theme of a fact, whether 
the fact fulfils the wish or not.” We are — as it were — surprised, 
not at anyone’s knowing the future, but at his being able to 
prophesy at all (right or wrong). 

As if the mere prophecy, no matter whether true or false, fore- 
shadowed the future; whereas it knows nothing of the future and 
cannot know less than nothing. 


Suppose you now ask: then are facts defined one way or another 
by an expectation — that is, is it defined for whatever event may 
occur whether it fulfils the expectation or not ? The answer has to 
be: Yes, unless the expression of the expectation is indefinite, 
e.g. by containing a disjunction of different possibilities. 


“The proposition determines in advance what will make it 
true.” Certainly, the proposition “‘p” determines that p must be 
the case in order to make it true; and that means: 

(the proposition p) = (the proposition that the fact p makes true). 
And the statement that the wish for it to be the case that p is satis- 


fied by the event p, merely enunciates a rule for signs: 


161 


(the wish for it to be the case that p) = (the wish that is satisfied by 
the event p). 

Like everything metaphysical the harmony between thought and 
reality is to be found in the grammar of the language. 


162 


IX 


113 Here instead of harmony or agreement of thought and 
reality one might say: the pictorial character of thought. But is 
this pictorial character an agreement? In the Tractatus I had said 
something like: it is an agreement of form. But that is misleading. 

Anything can be a picture of anything, if we extend the concept 
of picture sufficiently. If not, we have to explain what we call a 
picture of something, and what we want to call the agreement of 
the pictorial character, the agreement of the forms. 

For what I said really boils down to this: that every projection 
must have something in common with what is projected no matter 
what is the method of projection. But that only means that I am 
here extending the concept of ‘having in common’ and am making 
it equivalent to the general concept of projection. So J am only 
drawing attention to a possibility of generalization (which of 
course can be very important). 


The agreement of thought and reality consists in this: if I say 
falsely that something is red, then, for all that, it isn’t red. And 
when I want to explain the word “red” to someone, in the sen- 
tence “That is not red”’, I do it by pointing to something red. 


In what sense can I say that a proposition is a picture ? When I 
think about it, I want to say: it must bea picture if it is to show me 
what J am to do, if Iam to be able to act in accordance with it. But 
in that case all you want to say is that you act in accordance with a 
proposition in the same sense as you act in accordance with a 
picture. 

To say that a proposition is a picture gives prominence to certain 
features of the grammar of the word “proposition”. 

Thinking is quite comparable to the drawing of pictures. 


But one can also say that what looks like an analogue of a propo- 
sition is actually a particular case of our general concept. When I 
compared the proposition with a ruler, strictly speaking what I did 
was to take the use of a ruler in making a statement of length as an 
example for all propositions. 


114 The sense of a proposition and the sense of a picture. If we 
compare a proposition with a picture, we must think whether we 
are comparing it to a portrait (a historical representation) or to a 
genre-picture. And both comparisons have point. 

Sentences in fiction correspond to genre-pictures. 

“When I look at a genre-picture, it ‘tells’ me something even 
though I don’t believe (imagine) for a moment that the people I 
see in it really exist, or that there have really been people in that 
situation.” 

Think of the quite different grammar of the expressions: 

“This picture shows people in a village inn.” 

“This picture shows the coronation of Napoleon.” 


(Socrates: “And if you have an idea must it not be an idea of 
something?’ - 'Theaetetus: “‘Necessarily.”’ - Socrates: “‘And if you 
have an idea of something, mustn’t it be of something real?” -— 
Theaetetus: “It seems so”’).! 


Does the picture tell me, for instance, “two people are sitting in 
an inn drinking wine?” Only if this proposition somehow enters 
into the process of understanding outside the picture, say if Isay which 
I look at the picture “here two people are sitting etc.” If the picture 
tells me something in this sense, it tells me words. But how far does 
it declare itself in these words ? After all, if reality is declaring itself 
via language, it is taking a long way round. 

So for the picture to tell me something it isn’t essential that 
words should occur to me while I look at it; because the picture was 
supposed to be the more direct language. 


Here it is important to realise that instead of a picture one might 
have considered a slice of material reality. For although our 
1. Theaetetus, 189A (immediately before the passage quoted in §90). 


164 


attitude to a painted table derives historically from our attitude to 
real tables, the latter is not a part of the former. 


115 So what the picture tells me is itself. 

Its telling me something will consist in my recognizing in it 
objects in some sort of characteristic arrangement. (If I say: “T 
see a table in this picture” then what I say characterizes the picture — 
as I said — in a manner which has nothing to do with the existence 
of a ‘real’ table. ‘“The picture shows me a cube” can e.g. mean: 
It contains the form (J.) 


Asked “Did you recognize your desk when you entered your 
room this morning?” —I should no doubt say “Certainly!” and 
yet it would be misleading to call what took place “a recognition”. 
Certainly the desk was not strange to me; I was not surprised to 
see it, as I should have been if another one had been standing there, 
or some unfamiliar kind of object. 


“Something is familiar if I know what it is.” 


“What does it mean: ‘this object is familiar to me’ ?” — “Well, 
I know that it’s a table.” But that can mean any number of things, 
such as “T know how it’s used’’, “I know it looks like a table when 


be i 


it’s opened out”’, “I know that it’s what people call ‘a table’. 


What kind of thing is “familiarity” ? What constitutes a view’s 
being familiar to me? (The question itself is peculiar; it does not 
sound like a grammatical question.) 

I would like to say: “I see what I see”. And the familiarity can 
only consist in my being at home in what I see. 

i 
116 “TI see what I see”: I say that because I don’t want to give a 
name to what I see. [don’t want to say “I see a flower” because that 


presupposes alinguistic convention, andI want a form of expression 
that makes no reference to the history of the impression. 


The familiarity consists in my recognizing that what I see is a 
flower. I may say: the utterance of the words “that is a flower” 
is a recognition reaction; but the criterion for recognition isn’t 
that I name the object correctly, but that when I look at it I utter 
aseries of sounds and havea certain experience. For that the sounds 
are the correct English word, or that they are a word at all in any 
existent language, isn’t part of my experience during the utterance. 


I want to exclude from my consideration of familiarity every- 
thing that is ‘historical’. When that’s been done what remains is 
impressions (experiences, reactions). Even where language does 
enter into our experience, we don’t consider it as an existing 
institution. 


So the multiplicity of familiarity, as I understand it, is that of 
feeling at home in what I see. It might consist in such facts as these: 
my glance doesn’t move restlessly (inquitingly) around the 
object. I don’t keep changing the way I look at it, but immediately 
fix on one and hold it steady. 


I see the picture of a heavy coat and have a feeling of warmth and 
cosiness; I see the picture of a winter landscape and shiver. These 
reactions, it might be said, are justified by earlier experience. 
But we aren’t concerned ow about the history of our experiences 
or about any such justification. 


No one will say that every time I enter a room, my long familiar 
surroundings, there is enacted a recognition of all that I see and 


have seen hundreds of times before. 


117 If we think of our understanding of a picture, of a genre 


166 


picture say, we are perhaps inclined to assume that there is a 
particular phenomenon of recognition and that we recognize 
the painted people as people, the painted trees as trees and so on. 
But when I look at a genre picture do I compare the painted 
people with real people etc. ? 
So should I say that I recognize the painted people as painted 
people? And similarly real people as real people ? 


Of course there is a phenomenon of recognition in a case where 
it takes some sort of investigation to recognize a drawing as a 
representation of a human being; but when I see a drawing 
immediately as the representation of a human being, nothing of 
that kind happens. 


A picture of a human face is a no less familiar object than the 
human face itself. But there is no question of recognition here. 


118 It is easy to have a false concept of the processes called 
“recognizing”; as if recognizing always consisted in comparing 
two impressions with one another. It is as if I carried a picture of an 
object with me and used it to perform an identification of an object 
as the one represented by the picture. Our memory seems to us to be 
the agent of such a comparison, by preserving a picture of what has 
been seen before, or by allowing us to look into the past(as if down 


a spy-glass). 


In most cases of recognition no such process takes place. 

Someone meets me in the street and my eyes are drawn to his 
face; perhaps I ask myself “who is that ?”’; suddenly the face begins 
to look different in a particular way, “it becomes familiar to me”; 
I smile, go up to him and greet him by name; then we talk of the 
past and while we do so perhaps a memory image of him comes 
before my mind, and I see him in a particular situation. 


Perhaps someone will say: if I hadn’t kept his image in my 
memory, I couldn’t have recognized him. But here he is either 
using a metaphor, or expressing a hypothesis. 


One might say: ““What I saw was memory-laden.” 


We say: “we couldn’t use words at all, if we didn’t recognize 
them and the objects they denote.” If (because of a faulty memory) 
we didn’t recognize the colour green for what it is then we couldn’t 
use the word “green”. But have we any sort of check on this 
recognition, so that we know that it is really a recognition ? If we 
speak of recognition, we mean that we recognize something as 
what, in accordance with other criteria, it is. ““To recognize” 
means “to recognize what és”. 


119 Familiarity gives confirmation to what we see, but not by 
comparing it with anything else. It gives it a stamp, as it were. 


On the other hand I would like to say: “what I see here in front 
of me is not amy old shape seen in a particular manner: what I see is 
my shoes, which I know, and not anything else”. But here it is just 
that two forms of expression fight against each other. 


This shape that I see — I want to say — is not simply a shape; it is 
one of the shapes I know; it is a shape marked out in advance. It 
is one of those shapes of which I already had a pattern in me; and 
only because it corresponds to such a pattern is it this familiar 
shape. (I as it were carry a catalogue of such shapes around with 
me, and the objects portrayed in it are the familiar ones.) 


But my already carrying the pattern round with me would be 
only a causal explanation of the present impression. It is like saying: 
this movement is made as easily as if it had been practised. 


168 


And it is not so much as if I were comparing the object with a 
picture set beside it, but as if the object coincided with the picture. So 
I see only one thing, not two. 


120 We say: “This face has a quite particular expression’’, and look 
perhaps for words to characterise it. 


Here it is easy to get into that dead-end in philosophy, where one 
believes that the difficulty of the task consists in this: our having to 
describe phenomena that are hard to get hold of, the present 
experience that slips quickly by, or something of the kind. Where 
we find ordinary language too crude, and it looks as if we were 
having to do, not with the phenomena of every-day, but with ones 
that “easily elude us, and in their coming to be and passing away, 
produce those others as an average effect”’. 


And here one must remember that all the phenomena that now 
strike us as so remarkable are the very familiar phenomena that 
don’t surprise us in the least when they happen. They don’t 
strike us as remarkable until we put them in a strange light by 
philosophizing. 


121 “What the picture tells me is itself” is what I want to say. That 
is, its telling me something consists in its own structure, in its own 
forms and colours. 

It is as if, e.g. “it tells me something” or “‘it is a picture” meant: 
it shows a certain combination of cubes and cylinders. 


“Tt tells me something” can mean: it narrates something to me, 
it is a story. 


\ 


It tells me itself, just as a proposition, a story tells me itself. 


The concept of a narrative picture is surely like that of a genre 
Picture (or a battle scene). If I wanted to explain what a battle 


scene is, I wouldn’t need to refer to any reality outside the picture, 
I would only have to talk about painted men, painted horses, 
painted cannon and so on. 


“The picture tells me something”: it uses words, so to speak: 
here ate eyes, mouth, nose, hands etc. I am comparing the picture 
to a combination of linguistic forms. 


The system of language, however, is not in the category of 
experience. The experiences characteristic of using the system are 
not the system. (Compare: the meaning of the word “or” and the 
ot-feeling). 


“Now, that series of signs tells me something; earlier, before I 
learnt the language, it said nothing to me’’. Let us suppose what we 
mean by that is that the sentence is now read with a particular 
experience. Certainly, before I learnt the language, that series of 
signs used not to make the same impression on me. Of course, if we 
disregard the causal element, the impression is quite independent 
of the system of language. — And there is something in me that is 
reluctant to say: the sentence’s telling me something is constituted 
by its making this impression on me. 

“It’s only in a language that something is a proposition” is what 
I want to say. 


122 ‘Language’ is only languages, plus things I invent by analogy 
with existing languages. Languages ave systems. 


“A proposition belongs to a language.” But that just means: it is 
units of languages that I call “propositions”. 


But we must pay attention to the ase of the expression “English 
language’’, otherwise we shall ask questions like ““What is the lan- 
guage? Is it all the sentences which have so far been spoken? Or 
the set of rules and words? etc. etc.”” What is the system ? Where is 
it? What is chess? All the games that have been played? The list 
of rules ? 


“A proposition is a unit of language.” “After all, what consti- 
170 


tutes propositions is the combination of words which might be 
otherwise combined.” But that means: what constitutes ptopo- 
sitions for me. That is the way I regard language. 


What we want to attend to is the system of language. 


123 Certainly I read a story and don’t give a hang about any 
system of language. I simply read, have impressions, see pictures 
in my mind’s eye, etc. I make the story pass before me like pictures, 
like a cartoon story. (Of course I do not mean by this that every 
sentence summons up one or more visual images, and that that is, 
say, the purpose of a sentence.) 


Let us imagine a picture story in schematic pictures, and thus 
more like the narrative in a language than a series of realistic 
pictures. Using such a picture-language we might in particular e.g, 
keep our hold on the course of battles. (Language-game.) And a 
sentence of our word-language approximates to a picture in this 
picture language much more closely than we think. 


Let us remember too that we don’t have to translate Da Bai 


such pictures into realistic ones in order to ‘understand’ them, any 
more than we ever translate photographs or film pictures into 
coloured pictures, although black-and-white men or plants in 
teality would strike us as unspeakably strange and frightful. 

Suppose we were to say at this point: “Something is a picture 
only in a picture-language”’ ? 


A sentence in a story gives us the same satisfaction as a picture. 


124 We can on the other hand imagine a language in whose use the 
impression made on us by the signs played no part; in which there 
was no question of an understanding, in the sense of such an 
impression. The signs are e.g. written and transmitted to us and we 
are able to take notice of them. (That is to say, the only impression 
that comes in here is the pattern of the sign.) If the sign is an order, 


I7I 


we translate it into action by means of rules, tables. It does not get 
as far as an impression like that of a picture; nor are stories written 
in this language. But there is perhaps a kind of reading for enter- 
tainment which consists in certain series of signs being translated 
into bodily movements to make a kind of dance. (Compare the 
remark about translation and code.) 


In this case one really might say “‘the series of signs is dead without 
the system”’. 


We could of course also imagine that we had to use rules and 
translate a verbal sentence into a drawing in order to get an im- 
pression from it. (That only the picture had a soul.) 


(I might say to my pupils: When you have been through these 
exercises you will think differently.) 


But even in our normal speech we may often quite disregard the 
impression made by a sentence so that all that is important is how 
we operate with the sentence (Frege’s conception of logic). 


“There is no such thing as an isolated proposition.” For what 
I call a “proposition” is a position in the game of language. 


Isn’t what misleads us the fact that I can look ever so closely 
at a position in a game without discovering that it is a position in a 
game? What misleads us here is something in the grammar of the 
expression “‘position in a game”’. 


Thinking is an activity, like calculating. No one would call 
calculating, or playing chess, a state. 


125 Let us imagine a kind of puzzle picture: there is not one 
particular object to find; at first glance it appears to us as a jumble 


172 


of meaningless lines, and only after some effort do we see it as, say, 
a picture of a landscape. — What makes the difference between the 
look of the picture before and after the solution ? It is clear that we 
see it differently the two times. But what does it amount to to say 
that after the solution the picture means something to us, whereas 
it meant nothing before ? 


We can also put this question like this: What is the general mark 
of the solution’s having been found? 


I will assume that as soon as it is solved I make the solution 
obvious by strongly tracing certain lines in the puzzle picture and 
perhaps putting in some shadows. Why do you call the picture you 
have sketched in a solution ? 

a) Because it is the clear representation of a group of spatial 
objects. 

b) Because it is the representation of a regular solid. 

c) Because it is a symmetrical figure. 

d) Because it is a shape that makes an ornamental impression on 
me. 

e) Because it is the representation of a body I am familiar with. 

f) Because there is a list of solutions and this shape (this body) is 
on the list. 

g) Because it represents a kind of object that I am very familiar 
with; for it gives me an instantaneous impression of familiarity, 
I instantly have all sorts of associations in connexion with it; I 
know what it is called; I know I have often seen it; I know what 
it is used for etc. 

h) Because it represents a face which strikes me as familiar. 

i) Because it represents a face which I recognize: «) it is the face 
of my friend so and so; f) itis a face which I have often seen pictures 
of. 

k) Because it represents an object which I remember having seen 
at some time. 

1) Because it is an ornament that I know well (though I don’t 
remember where I have seen it). 


173 


m) Because it is an ornament that I know well; I know its name, 
I know where I have seen it. 

n) Because it represents part of the furniture of my room. 

0) Because I instinctively traced out those lines and now feel 
easy. 

p) Because I remember that this object has been described. 

q) Because I seem to be familiar with the object, a word occurs 
to me at once as its name (although the word does not belong to 
any existent language); I tell myself “of course, that is an « such 
as I have often seen in 8; one ys 8’s with it until they <.”” Something 
of the kind occurs e.g. in dreams. 

And so on. 


(Anyone who does not understand why we talk about these 
things must feel what we say to be mere trifling.) 


126 The impression is one thing, and the impression’s being 
determinate is another thing. 

What I call the impression of familiarity is as multifarious as 
being determinate is. 


When we look into a human face that we know very well, we 
need not have any impression, our wits may be completely dull, 
so to speak; and between that case and a strong impression there 
are any number of stages. 


Suppose the sight of a face has a strong effect on us, inspiring 
us say with fear. Am I to say: first of all there must occur an 
impression of familiarity, the form of the human face as such must 
make an impression of familiarity on me, and only then is the 
impression of fear added to that impression ? — Isn’t it like this, that 
what I call the impression of specific familiarity is a characteristic 
of every strong impression that a face makes on me? — The 
characteristic, say of determinacy. I did indeed say that the im- 
pression of familiarity consists in things like our feeling at home 


in what we see, in our not changing our way of looking and the 
like. 


174 


127 Can I think away the impression of individual familiarity 
where it exists; and think it into a situation where it does not? 
And what does that mean? I see e.g. the face of a friend and ask 
myself: what does this face look like if I see it as an unfamiliar face 
(as if I were seeing it now for the first time) ? What remains, as it 
were, of the look of this face, if I think away, subtract, the im- 
pression of familiarity from it? Here I am inclined to say: “It is 
very difficult to separate the familiarity from the impression of the 
face.” But I also feel that this is a misleading way of putting things. 
For I have no notion how I should so much as try to separate these 
two things. The expression “to separate them” does not have any 
clear sense for me. 

I know what sis means: “Imagine this table black instead of 
brown’’; it means something like: “paint a picture of this table, 
but black instead of brown”; or similarly: “draw this man but 
with longer legs than he has’”’. 


Suppose someone were to say “Imagine this butterfly exactly as 
it is, but ugly instead of beautiful” ?! 


“Tt is very difficult to think away ...”: here it looks as if it was 
a matter of a psychological difficulty, a difficulty of introspection or 


the like. (That is true of a large range of philosophical problems: 
think of the problem of the exact reproduction or description of 


what is seen in the visual field; of the description of the perpetual 
flux of phenomena; also of “chow many raindrops do you see, if 
you look at the rain ?’’) 

Compare: “It is difficult Zo wi// that table to move from a dis- 
tance.” 


In this case we have not determined what thinking the familiarity 
away is to mean. 

It might mean, say, to recall the impression which I had when I 
saw the face for the first time. And here again one must know what 
it means to “/ry” to remember the impression. For that has 
several meanings. Let us ask ourselves what activities we call 


175 


“trying to remember something”. What do we do if we want to 
remember what we had for lunch yesterday? Is that method 
available for the early memories of an adult ? Can one ¢ry to remem- 
ber one’s own birth ? 


I tell myself: I want to try to look at a printed English word and 
see it as if I hadn’t learnt to read, as if the black shapes on the paper 
were strange drawings whose purpose I couldn’t imagine or 
guess. And then what happens is that I can’t look at the printed 
word without the sound of the word or of the letter I’m actually 
looking at coming before my mind. 


For someone who has no knowledge of such things a diagram 
representing the inside of a radio receiver will be a jumble of 
meaningless lines. But if he is acquainted with the apparatus and 
its function, that drawing will be a significant picture for him. 

Given some solid figure (say in a picture) that means nothing to 
me at present — can I at will imagine it as meaningful ? That’s as if 
I were asked: Can I imagine a body of any old shape as an ap- 
pliance? But for what sort of use? 

Well, at any rate one class of corporeal shapes can readily be 
imagined as dwellings for beasts or men. Another class as weapons. 
Another as models of landscapes. Etc. etc. So here I know how I 
can ascribe meaning to a meaningless shape. 


128 If 1 say that this face has an expression of gentleness, or kind- 
ness, or cowatdice, I don’t seem just to mean that we associate 
such and such feelings with the look of the face, I’m tempted to 
say that the face is itself one aspect of the cowardice, kindness, etc. 
(Compare e.g. Weininger). It is possible to say: I see cowardice in 
this face (and might see it in another too) but at all events it doesn’t 
seem to be merely associated, outwardly connected, with the face; 


the fear has the multiplicity of the facial features. And if, for 
example, the features change slightly, we can speak of a corres- 
ponding change in the fear. If we were asked “Can you think of 
this face as an expression of courage too ?”’ — we should, as it were, 
not know how to lodge courage in these features. Then perhaps 
I say “I don’t know what it would mean if this is a courageous 
face.” [This sentence cannot be corrected by saying “for this to be 
a courageous face”’ instead of “‘if this is a courageous face”’].! But 
what would an answer to such a question be like? Perhaps one 
says: “Yes, now I understand: the face as it were shews indiffer- 
ence to the outer world.” So we have somehow read courage into 
the face. Now once more, one might say, courage fits this face. 
But what fits what here? 


There is a related case (though perhaps it will not seem so) 
when for example we (Germans) are surprised that the French do 
not simply say “the man is good” but put an attributive adjective 
where there should be a predicative one; and when we solve the 
problem for ourselves by saying: they mean: “the man is good one”’. 


Couldn’t different interpretations of a facial expression consist 
in my imagining each time a different kind of sequel? Certainly 
that’s often how it is. I see a picture which represents a smiling 
face. What do I do if I take the smile now as a kind one, now as 
malicious ? Don’t I imagine it with a spatial and temporal context 
which I call kind or malicious ? Thus I might supply the picture 
with the fancy that the smiler was smiling down at a child at play, 
or again on the suffering of an enemy. 

This is in no way altered by the fact that I can also take the at 
first sight gracious situation and interpret it differently by putting 
it into a wider context. — If no special circumstances reverse my 
interpretation I shall conceive a particular smile as kind, call it a 
“kind”-one, react correspondingly. 


1. Cf. Philosophical Investigations, 1, §537 (Trs.) 


177 


That is connected with the contrast between saying and meaning. 

“Any expression can lie”: but you must think what you mean by 
“lie”. How do you imagine a lie? Aren’t you contrasting one 
expression with another? At any rate, you are contrasting with 
the expression some other process which might very well be an 
expression. 


129 What does it mean: “to read kindness info the smile” ? Perhaps 
it means: I make a face which is coordinated with the smiling face 
in a particular way. I coordinate my face to the other one in some 
such way as to exaggerate one or other of its features. 


A friendly mouth, friendly eyes. How would one think of a 
friendly hand? Probably open and not as a fist. - And could one 
think of the colour of a man’s hair as an expression of friendliness 
ot the opposite? Put like that the question seems to ask whether 
we can manage to. The question ought to run: Do we want to call 
anything a friendly or unfriendly hair-colour ? If we wanted to give 
such words a sense, we should perhaps imagine a man whose hair 
darkened when he got angry. The reading of an angry expression 
into dark hair, however, would work va a previously existent 
conception. 

It may be said: the friendly eyes, the friendly mouth, the wagging 
of a dog’s tail, are among the primary and mutually independent 
symbols of friendliness; I mean: They are parts of the phenomena 
that are called friendliness. If one wants to imagine further ap- 
pearances as expressions of friendliness, one reads these symbols 
into them. We say: “‘He has a black look”’, perhaps because the 
eyes are more strongly shadowed by the eyebrows; and now we 
transfer the idea of darkness to the colour of the hair. He has 
glowering hair. If I were asked whether I could imagine a chair 
with a friendly expression, it would be above all a friendly facial 
expression Y would want to imagine it with; I would want to 
read a friendly face into it. 


I say “I can think of this face (which at first gives an impression 
of timidity) as courageous too.” We do not mean by this that I can 
imagine someone with this face perhaps saving someone’s life 
(that, of course, is imaginable in connexion with any face). | am 
speaking rather of an aspect of the face itself. Nor do I mean that 
I can imagine that this man’s face might change so that, in the 
ordinary sense, it looked courageous; though I may very well 
mean that there is quite a definite way in which it can change into a 
courageous face. The reinterpretation of a facial expression can be 
compared with the reinterpretation of a chord in music, when we 
hear it as a modulation first into this, then into that key. (Compare 
also the distinction between mixed colours and intermediary 
colours). 


Suppose we ask ourselves “what proper name would suit the 
character of this man” — and portray it in sound? The method of 
projection we use for the portrayal is something which as it were 
stands firm. (A writer might ask himself what name he wants to 
give to a person.) But sometimes we project the character into the 
name that has been given. Thus it appears to us that the great 
masters have names which uniquely fit the character of their works. 


Experience of the real size. Suppose we saw a picture showing a 
chair-shape; we are told it represents a construction the size of a 
house. Now we see it differently. 


What happens when we learn to feel the ending of a church 
mode as an ending ? 


Think of the multifariousness of what we call “language”. 
Word-language, picture-language, gesture-language, sound-lan- 
guage. 


130 “ ‘This object is familiar to me’ is like saying ‘this object is 
portrayed in my catalogue’.” In that case it would consist in the fact 
that it was a picture filed with others in a particular folder, in /his 
drawer. But if that really is what I imagine - if I think I simply 


179 


compare the seen object with pictures in my catalogue and find 
it to agree with one of them —it is something quite unlike the 
phenomenon of familiarity. That is, we are making the assumption 
that the picture in our catalogue is itself familiar. If it were some- 
thing strange, then the fact that it was in this folder, in this drawer, 
would mean nothing to us. 


When I speak of a pattern in my mental catalogue, or of a sheath 
into which an object fits if it is familiar, what I would like to say 
is that the sheath in my mind is, as it were, the “form of imagining”, 
so that it isn’t possible for me to say of a pattern that it is in my 
mind unless it really is there. — The pattern as it were retires into 
my mind, so that it is no longer presented to it as an object. But 
that only means: it didn’t make sense to talk of a pattern at all. 
(The spatial spectacles we can’t take off.) 


If we represent familiarity as an object’s fitting into a sheath, 
that’s not quite the same as our comparing what is seen with a copy. 
What we really bave in mind is the feeling when the object slips 
smoothly into the contour of the sheath. But that is a feeling we 
might have even if there were no such perfectly fitting sheath 
there at all. 

We might also imagine that every object had an invisible sheath; 
that alters nothing in our experience, it is an empty form of repre- 
sentation. 


It shouldn’t really be “Yes, I recognize it, it’s a face” but “I 
recognize it, I see a face”. (Here the word face might mean for me 
the mere ornament @ and have no reference to the human face; 
it might be ona level with any other familiar figure, e.g. a swastika.) 
For the question is: “What do I recognize as what?” Por “to recog- 
nize a thing as itself” is meaningless. 


180 


131 The comparison between memory and a notebook. On the 
one hand this comparison serves as a picture of the conscious 
phenomena, and on the other hand it provides a psychological 
model. (And the word “conscious” is a reference to a chapter of the 
grammar and is not one side of the psychological contrast between 
“conscious” and “unconscious’’.) 


Many very different things happen when we remember. 

“Have you been in your room?” “Yes”. “Are you sure?” 
“T would know if I hadn’t been here yesterday!” For this I don’t 
need to see myself, even for a moment, in memory in my room. 
But let’s assume that when I said that I saw myself standing at the 
window in my room; how does the picture show me that it was 
yesterday ? Of course, the picture could show that as well, if for 
instance I saw in it a wall-calendar with yesterday’s date. But if 
that wasn’t the case, how did I read off from the memory image, or 
from the memory, that I stood thus at the window yesterday? How 
do I translate the experience of remembering into words ? — But 
did I translate an experience into words? Didn’t I just utter the 
words in a particular tone of voice with other experiences of 
certainty ? But wasn’t that the experience of remembering ? (The 
experience of translating is the same kind of thing as the experience 
of the tone of voice.) But what made you so certain when you spoke 
those words ? Nothing made me certain; I was certain. 

Of course, I have other ways of checking — as one might say — 
what I then uttered. That is: I can now try to remember particular 
things that happened yesterday and to call up pictures before my 
mind’s eye etc. But certainly that didn’t have to have happened 
before I answered. 


When we narrate a set of events from memory we do sometimes 
see memory pictures in our mind; but commonly they are only 
scattered through the memory like illustrations in a story book. 


Someone says to me “Imagine a patch of the colour called ‘red’ 
on this white wall’’. I do so — shall I now say that I remembered 


181 


which colour is called ‘red’? When I talk about this table, do I 


remember that this object is called a ‘table’? 


Mightn’t someone object: “So if a man has not learned a lan- 
guage is he unable to have certain memories?” Of course — he 
cannot have verbal memories, verbal wishes and so on. And 
memories etc. in language are not mere threadbare representations 
of the real experiences ; for is what is linguistic not an experience ? 


(Words are deeds.) 


Some men recall a musical theme by having an image of the score 
rise before them, and reading it off. 

It could be imagined that what we call “memory” in some man 
consisted in his seeing himself looking things up in a notebook in 
spirit, and that what he read in that book was what he remembered. 
(How do I react to a memory ?) 


Incidentally, when I treat the objects around me as familiar, do I 
think of that comparison ? Of course not. I only do so when I look 
at the act of recognition (individual recognition) after the event; 
and not so much when I look at it to see what actually happened, as 
when I look at it through a preconceived schema. (The flux of 
time.)! 


132 If one takes it as obvious that a man takes pleasure 1n his own 
fantasies, let it be remembered that fantasy does not correspond 
to a painted picture, to a sculpture or a film, but to a complicated 
formation out of heterogeneous components — words, pictures, 
etc. Then one will not contrast operating with written and spoken 


1. [Earlier draft of the parenthesis]. (Something very similar to this is the 
problem of the nature and flow of time). 


182 


signs with operating with “imagination-pictures” of events. 


(The ugliness of a human being can repel in a picture, in a pain- 
ting, as in reality, but so it can too in a description, in words.) 


Attitude to a picture (to a thought). The way we experience a 
picture makes it real for us, that is, connects it with reality; it 
establishes a continuity with reality. 

(Fear connects a picture with the terrors of reality.) 


183 


133 Can an ostensive definition come into collision with the other 
rules for the use of a word? — It might appear so; but rules can’t 
collide, unless they contradict each other. That aside, it is they that 
determine a meaning; there isn’t a meaning that they are answerable 
to and could contradict. 


Grammar is not accountable to any reality. It is grammatical 
rules that determine meaning (constitute it) and so they themselves 
are not answerable to any meaning and to that extent are arbitrary. 


There cannot be a question whether these or other rules are the 
correct ones for the use of ‘“‘not”’ (that is, whether they accord with 
its meaning). For without these rules the word has as yet no 
meaning; and if we change the rules, it now has another meaning 
(or none), and in that case we may just as well change the word too. 


“The only correlate in language to an intrinsic necessity is an 
arbitrary rule. It is the only thing which one can milk out of this 
intrinsic necessity into a proposition.””! 


Why don’t I call cookery rules arbitrary, and why am I tempted 
to call the rules of grammar arbitrary? Because I think of the 
concept “cookery” as defined by the end of cookery, and I don’t 
think of the concept “language” as defined by the end of language. 
You cook badly if you are guided in your cooking by rules other 
than the right ones; but if you follow other rules than 'those of 
chess you are playing another game; and if you follow grammatical 


1. In pencil in the MS: [Perhaps apropos of the paradox that mathematics 
consists of rules.] 


184 


rules other than such and such ones, that does not mean you say 
something wrong, no, you are speaking of something else. 


If I want to carve a block of wood into a particular shape any 
cut that gives it the right shape is a good one. But I don’t call an 
argument a good argument just because it has the consequences I 
want (Pragmatism). I may call a calculation wrong even if the 
actions based on its result have led to the desired end. (Compare 
the joke “I’ve hit the jackpot and he wants to give me lessons!”’!) 
That shows that the justifications in the two cases are different, 
and also that “justification” means something different in each 
case. In the one case one can say “‘Just wait, you will soon see that 
it will come out right (i.e. as desired)”. In the other case that is no 
justification. 


The connection between the rules of cookery and the grammar 
of the word “cook” is not the same as that between the rules of 
chess and the expression “play chess” or that between the rules of 
multiplication and the grammar of the word “multiply”. 


The rules of grammar ate arbitrary in the same sense as the 
choice of a unit of measurement. But that means no more than that 
the choice is independent of the length of the objects to be measured 
and that the choice of one unit is not ‘true’ and of another ‘false’ 
in the way that a statement of length is true or false. Of course that 
is only a remark on the grammar of the word “unit of length”. 


134 One is tempted to justify rules of grammar by sentences like 
“But there are really four primary colours”. And if we say that the 


1. A tells B that he has hit the jackpot in the lottery ; he saw a box lying in the 
street with the numbers 5 and 7 on it. He worked out that 5 x 7 = 64- and 
took the number 64. 

B: But 5 x 7 isn’t 64! 

A: Pve hit the jackpot and he wants to give me lessons! 


185 


rules of grammar are arbitrary, that is directed against the possibility 
of this justification. Yet can’t it after all be said that the grammar 
of colour words characterizes the world as it actually is? One 
would like to say: May I not really look in vain for a fifth primary 
colour? (And if looking is possible, then finding is conceivable.) 
Doesn’t grammar put the primary colours together because there 
isa kind of similarity between them? Or colours, anway, in contrast 
to shapes or notes? Or, when I set this up as the right way of 
dividing up the world, have I a preconceived idea in my head as a 
paradigm ? Of which in that case I can say: “Yes, that is the way 
we look at things” or “We just do want to form this sort of 
picture.” For if I say “there is a particular similarity among the 
primary colours” — whence do I derive the idea of this similarity ? 
Just as the idea ‘primary colour’ is nothing else but ‘blue or red 
or green or yellow’ is not the idea of that similarity too given 
simply by the four colours ? Indeed, aren’t these concepts the same ? 
(For here it can be said: “what would it be like if these colours did 
not have this similarity ?’’) (Think of a group containing the four 
primary colours plus black and white, or the visible colours plus 
ultraviolet and infrared.) 


I do not call rules of representation conventions if they can be 
justified by the fact that a representation made in accordance with 
them will agree with reality. For instance the rule “paint the sky 
brighter than anything that receives its light from it’ is not a 
convention. 

The rules of grammar cannot be justified by shewing that their 
application makes a representation agree with reality. For this 
justification would itself have to describe what is represented. And 
if something can be said in the justification and is permitted by its 
grammar — why shouldn’t it also be permitted by the grammar 
that Iam trying to justify ? Why shouldn’t both forms of expression 


186 


have the same freedom ? And how could what the one says restrict 
what the other can say ? 


But can’t the justification simply point to reality ? 

How far is such pointing a justification? Does it have the 
multiplicity of a justification ? Of course it may be the cause of our 
saying one sentence rather than another. But does it give a reason 
for it? Is that what we call a justification? 


No one will deny that studying the nature of the rules of games 
must be useful for the study of grammatical rules, since it is beyond 
doubt there is some sort of similarity between them. — The right 
thing is to let the certain instinct that there is a kinship lead one 
to look at the rules of games without any preconceived judgement 
or prejudice about the analogy between games and grammar. 
And here again one should simply report what one sees and not be 
afraid that one is undermining a significant and correct intuition, 
or, on the other hand, wasting one’s time with something super- 
fluous. 


135 One can of course consider language as part of a psychological 
mechanism. The simplest case is if one uses a restricted concept of 
language in which language consists only of commands. 

One can then consider how a foreman directs the work of a 
group of people by shouting. 


One can imagine a man inventing language, imagine him dis- 
covering how to train other human beings to work in his place, 
training them through reward and punishment to perform certain 
tasks when he shouts. This discovery would be like the invention 
of a machine. 


Can one say that grammar describes language? If we consider 
language as part of the psycho-physical mechanism which we use 


187 


when we utter words — like pressing keys on a keyboard — to make 
a human machine work for us, then we can say that grammar 
describes that part of the machine. In that case a correct language 
would be one which would stimulate the desired activities. 


Clearly I can establish by experience that a human being (or 
animal) reacts to one sign as I want him to, and to another not. 
That e.g. a human being goes to the right at the sign “‘ > ”and goes 
to the left at the sign “ <”; but that he does not react to the sign 
“O—|”as to “<—””, 

1 do not even need to fabricate a case, I have only to consider 
what is in fact the case; namely, that I can direct a man who has 
learned only German, only by using the German language. (For 
here I am looking at learning German as adjusting (conditioning) a 
mechanism to respond to a certain kind of influence; and it may 
be all one to us whether someone else has learned the language, or 
was perhaps from birth constituted to react to sentences in German 
like a normal person who has learned it.) 


Suppose I now made the discovery that someone would bring 
me sugar at a sign plus the cry “Su”, and would bring me milk at a 
sign and the cry “Mi”, and would not do so in response to other 
words. Should I say that this shows that “Su” is the correct (the 
only correct) sign for sugar, “Mi” the correct sign for milk? 

Well, if I say that, I am not using the expression “sign for sugar” 
in the way it is ordinarily used or in the way I intended to use it. 


I do not use “that is the sign for sugar” in the same way as the 
sentence “if I press this button, I get a piece of sugar”. 


136 Allthe same, let us compare grammar witha system of buttons, 
a keyboard which I can use to direct a man or a machine by pressing 


188 


different combinations of keys. What corresponds in this case to 
the grammar of language ? 

It is easy to construct such a keyboard, for giving different 
“commands” to the machine. Let’s look at a very simple one: it 
consists of two keys, the one marked “go” and the other “come”. 
Now one might think it must obviously be a rule of the grammar 
that the two keys shouldn’t be depressed simultaneously (that 
would give rise to a contradiction). But what does happen if we 
press them both at the same time? Am I assuming that this has an 
effect ? Or that it has no effect? In each case I can designate the 
effect, or the absence of an effect, as the point and sense of the 
simultaneous depression of both keys. 


Or: When I say that the orders “Bring me sugar” and “Bring 
me milk” make sense, but not the combination “Milk me sugar”, 
that does not mean that the utterance of this combination of words 
has no effect. And if its effect is that the other person stares at me 
and gapes, I don’t on that account call it the order to stare and 
gape, even if that was precisely the effect that I wanted to produce. 


“This combination of words makes no sense”’ does not mean it 
has no effect. 
Not even “‘it does not have the desired effect’’. 


137 To say “This combination of words makes no sense” excludes 
it from the sphere of language and thereby bounds the domain of 
language. But when one draws a boundary it may be for various 
kinds of reasons. If I surround an area with a fence or a line or 
otherwise, the purpose may be to prevent someone from getting 
in or out; but it may also be part of a game, and the players be 
supposed, say, to jump over the boundary; or it may show where 
A’s property ends and B’s begins; and so on. So if] draw a boundary 
line that is not yet to say what I am drawing it for. 


Language is not defined for us as an arrangement fulfilling a 
definite purpose. Rather “language” is for me a name for a collec- 
tion and I understand it as including German, English, and so on, 
and further various systems of signs which have more or less 
affinity with these languages. 


Language is of interest to me as a phenomenon and not as a 
means to a particular end. 


138 Grammar consists of conventions. An example of such 
conventions be one saying “the word ‘red’ means this colour’’. 
Such a convention may be included say in a chart. — Well, now, 
how could a convention find a place in a mechanism (like the works 
of a pianola ?) Well, it is quite possible that there is a part of the 
mechanism which resembles a chart, and is inserted between the 
language-like part of the mechanism and the rest of it. 


Of course an ostensive definition of a word sets up a connection 
between a word and ‘a thing’, and the purpose of this connection 
may be that the mechanism of which our language is a part should 
function in a certain way. So the definition can make it work 
properly, like the connection between the keys and the hammers in 
a piano; but the connection doesn’t consist in the hearing of the 
words now having ¢his effect, since the effect may actually be 
caused by the making of the convention. And it is the connection 
and not the effect which determines the meaning. 


When someone is taught language, does he learn at the same 
time what is sense and nonsense ? When he uses language to what 
extent does he employ grammar, and in particular the distinction 
between sense and nonsense ? 


190 


When someone learns musical notation, he is supplied with a 
kind of grammar. This is to say: this note corresponds to this key 
on the piano, the sign # sharpens a note, the sign 4 cancels the # etc. 
etc. If the pupil asked whether there was a distinction between 


= and or what the sign == meant, we would tell him that 


the distance between the top of the note and the stave didn’t mean 
anything, and so on. One can view this instruction as part of the 
preparation that makes the pupil into a playing-machine. 


So he can speak of a grammar in the case where a language is 
taught to a person by a mere drill? It is clear that if I want to use 
the word “grammar” here I can do so only in a “degenerate”’ 
sense, because it is only in a degenerate sense that I can speak of 
“explanation’”’, or of “convention’’. 

And a trained child or animal is not acquainted with any 
problems of philosophy. 


139 When I said that for us a language was not something that 
achieved a particular end, but a concept defined by certain systems 
we call “languages” and such systems as are constructed by 
analogy with them —I could also have expressed the same thing 
in the following way: causal connections in the mechanism of 
language are things that I don’t scruple to invent. 


Imagine that someone were to explain “Language is whatever 
one can use to communicate”. What constitutes communication ? 
To complete the explantation we should have to describe what 
happens when one communicates; and in the process certain causal 
connections and empirical regularities would come out. But these 
are just the things that wouldn’t interest me; they are the kinds of 


191 


connection I wouldn’t hesitate to make up. I wouldn’t call just 
anything that opened the door a “key-bit”, but only something 
with a particular form and structure. 

“Language” is a word like “keyboard”. There are machines 
which have keyboards. For some reason or other I might be 
interested in forms of keyboard (both ones in actual use and others 
merely devised by myself). And to invent a keyboard might mean 
to invent something that had the desired effect; or else to devise new 
forms which were similar to the old ones in various ways. 


“It is always for living beings that signs exist, so that must be 
something essential to a sign.” Yes, but how is a “living” being 
defined ? It appears that here I am prepared to use its capacity to 
use a sign-language as a defining mark of a living being. 

And the concept of a living being really has an indeterminacy 
very similar to that of the concept “language”. 


140 To invent a language could mean to invent an instrument for 
a particular purpose on the basis of the laws of nature (or consis- 
tently with them); but it also has the other sense, analogous to that 
in which we speak of the invention of a game. 

Here I am stating something about the grammar of the word 
“language” by connecting it with the grammar of the word 


“invent’’. 


Are the rules of chess arbitrary ? Imagine that it turned out that 
only chess entertained and satisfied people. Then the rules aren’t 
arbitrary if the purpose of the game is to be achieved. 

“The rules of a game are arbitrary” means: the concept ‘game’ 
is not defined by the effect the game is supposed to have on us. 


192 


There is an analogous sense in which it is arbitrary which unit 
of measurement we use to express a length, and another sense in 
which the choice of units is limited or determined. 


For us language is a calculus; it is characterized by /inguistic 
activities. 


Where does language get its significance ? Can we say “Without 
language we couldn’t communicate with one another”? No. It’s 
not like “without the telephone we couldn’t speak from Europe 
to America”. We can indeed say “without a mouth human beings 
couldn’t communicate with each other’. But the concept of 
language 7s contained in the concept of communication. 


141 Is philosophy a creation of word-language ? Is word-language 
a necessary condition for the existence of philosophy? It would 
be more proper to ask: is there anything like philosophy outside 
the region of our word-languages ? For philosophy isn’t anything 
except philosophical problems, the particular individual worries 
that we call “philosophical problems”. Their common element ex- 
tends as far as the common element in different regions of our 
language. 

Let us consider a particular philosophical problem, such as 
“How is it possible to measure a period of time, since the past and 
the future aren’t present and the present is only a point?” The 
characteristic feature of this is that a confusion is expressed in the 
form of a question that doesn’t acknowledge the confusion, and 
that what re/eases the questioner from his problem is a particular 
alteration of his method of expression. 


I could imagine an organ whose stops were to be operated by 
keys distributed among the keys of the manual which looked 
exactly like them. There might then arise a philosophical problem: 
“How are silent notes possible?” And the problem would be 


193 


solved by someone having the idea of replacing the stop-keys by 
stops which had no similarity with the note-keys. 

A problem or worry like a philosophical one might arise 
because someone p/ayed on all the keys of the manual, and the 
result didn’t sound like music, and yet he was tempted to think that 
it must be music etc. 


(Something that at first sight looks like a sentence and is not 
one.) 

The following design for the construction of a steam roller was 
shown to me and seems to be of philosophical interest. The 
inventor’s mistake is akin to a philosophical mistake. The in- 
vention consists of a motor inside a hollow roller. The crank-shaft 
runs through the middle of the roller and is connected at both ends 
by spokes with the wall of the roller. The cylinder of the petrol- 
engine is fixed onto the inside of the roller. At first glance this 
construction looks like a machine. But it is a rigid system and the 
piston cannot move to and fro in the cylinder. Unwittingly we 
have deprived it of all possibility of movement. 


142 “Could a language consist simply of independent signals ?” 
Instead of this we might ask: Are we willing to call a series of 
independent signals “‘a language”? To the question “‘can such a 
language achieve the same as one which consists of sentences, or 
combinations of signs ?”’ one would have to answer: it is experience 


194 


that will show us whether e.g. these signals have the same effect on 
human beings as sentences. But the effect is of no interest to us; 
we are looking at the phenomenon, the calculus of language. 

Imagine something like a diary kept with signals. One side is 
divided into sections for the hours of the day, like a timetable. The 
sign “A” means: I am sleeping; “B” means “I am working”; 
“C” J am eating, etc. etc. But now the question is: are explanations 
likethis given, so thatthe signals are connected toanother language ? 
Is the signal-language supplemented with ostensive definitions of 
the signals ? Or is the language really only to consist of the signs 
A, B, C etc. ? 

Suppose someone asked: “how do you know, that you are now 
doing the same as you were an hour ago?”, and I answered: “T 
wrote it down, yes, here there’s a ‘C’”” - Can one ask whether the 
sign “A” always means the same? In what circumstances can this 
question be answered one way or the other? (One can imagine a 
language in which the words, the names of the colours, say, changed 
their meanings with the day of the week; this colour is called “red” 
on Monday, “blue” on Tuesday. “A =A” might say that in the 
language to which this rule applies there is no change in the meaning 
of the sign “‘A”’.) 


Imagine again a language consisting of commands. It is to be 
used to direct the movements of a human being; a command 
specifies the distance, and adds one of the words “forwards”, 
“backwards”, “right” and “left” and one of the words “fast” and 
“slowly”. Now of course all the commands which will actually be 
used to direct the movements of a human being; a command 
such signals in the first place as abbreviations of the sentences of 
the first language, perhaps translating them back into it before 
obeying them, and then later on act immediately in response to the 
signals. — In that case we might speak of two languages and say 
the first was more pictorial than the second. That is, we wouldn’t 


195 


say that a series of such signals by itself would enable me to derive 
a picture of the movement of a man obeying them unless in 
addition to the signal there is something that might be called a 
general rule for translating into drawing. We wouldn’t say: from 
the sign a b b cd you can derive the figure 


re 


but we would say that you can derive it from a b b cd plus the table 


a | 
b | — 
e | t 
d < 


We can say: the grammar exp/ains the meaning of the signs and 
thus makes the language pictorial. 

I can justify the choice of a word by a grammar. But that doesn’t 
mean that I do, or have to, use definitions to justify the words I 
use in a description or something similar. 


A comparable case is when ordinary grammar completes an 
elliptical sentence, and so takes a particular construction as an 
abbreviated sentence. 


Appendix 


I 
Complex and Fact 


The use of the words ‘fact’ and ‘act’ —“That was a noble act.’ 
— ‘But, that never happened.’ — 

Tt is natural to want to use the word ‘act’ so that it only corres- 
ponds to a ¢rue proposition. So that we then don’t talk of an act 
which was never performed. But the proposition “That was a 
noble act’ must still have a sense even if I am mistaken in thinking 
that what I call an act occurred. And that of itself contains all that 
matters, and I can only make the stipulation that I will only use the 
words ‘fact’, ‘act’ (perhaps also ‘event’) in a proposition which, 
when complete, asserts that this fact obtains. 


It would be better to drop the restriction on the use of these 
words, since it only leads to confusion, and say quite happily: 
‘This act was never performed’, ‘This fact does not obtain’, 
‘This event did not occur’. 


Complex is not like fact. For I can, e.g., say of a complex that it 
moves from one place to another, but not of a fact. 
But that this complex is now situated here is a fact. 


‘This complex of buildings is coming down’ is tantamount to: 
‘The buildings thus grouped together are coming down’. 


I call a flower, a house, a constellation, complexes: moreover, 
complexes of petals, bricks, stars etc. 

That this constellation is located here, can of course be described 
by a proposition in which only its stars are mentioned and neither 
the word ‘constellation’ nor its name occurs. 


But that is all there is to say about the relation between complex 


and fact. And a complex is a spatial object, composed of spatial 
objects. (The concept ‘spatial’ admitting of a certain extension.) 


A complex is composed of its parts, the things of a kind which 
go to make it up. (This is of course a grammatical proposition 
concerning the words ‘complex’, ‘part’ and ‘compose’.) 


To say that a red circle is composed of redness and circularity, or 
is a complex with these component parts, is a misuse of these words 
and is misleading. (Frege was aware of this and told me.) 

It is just as misleading to say the fact that this circle is red (that 
I am tired) is a complex whose component parts are a circle and 
redness (myself and tiredness). 


Neither is a house a complex of bricks and their spatial relations. 
i.e. that too goes against the correct use of the word. 


Now, you can of course point at a constellation and say: this 
constellation is composed entirely of objects with which I am 
already acquainted; but you can’t ‘point at a fact’ and say this. 


‘To describe a fact’, or ‘the description of a fact’, is also a 
misleading expression for the assertion stating that the fact ob- 
tains, since it sounds like: ‘describing the animal that I saw’. 


Of course we also say: ‘to point out a fact’, but that always 
means; ‘to point out the fact that ...’. Whereas ‘to point at (or 
point out) a flower’ doesn’t mean to point out that this blossom is 
on this stalk; for we needn’t be talking about this blossom and this 
stalk at all. 


It’s just as impossible for it to mean: to point out the fact that this 
flower is situated there. 

To point outa fact means to assert something, to state something. 
“To point out a flower’ doesn’t mean this. 


200 


A chain, too, is composed of its links, not of these and their 


spatial relations. 


The fact that these links are so concatenated, isn’t ‘composed’ 


of anything at all. 


The root of this muddle is the confusing use of the word ‘object’. 


The part is smaller than the whole: applied to fact and compo- 
nent part (constituent), that would yield an absurdity. 


The schema: thing-property. We say that actions have properties, 
like swiftness, or goodness.

Concept and Object, Property and Substrate 


When Frege and Russell talk of concept and object they really 
mean property and thing; and here I’m thinking in particular of a 
spatial body and its colour. Or one can say: concept and object are 
the same as predicate and subject. The subject-predicate form is 
one of the forms of expression that occur in human languages. 
It is the form “x is y” (“x € y’’): “My brother is tall”, ““The storm 
is nearby”, “This circle is red”, “Augustus is strong”, “2 is a 
number”, “This thing is a piece of coal”. 

The concept of a material point in physics is an abstraction from 
the material objects of experience; in the same way the subject- 
predicate form of logic is an abstraction from the subject-predicate 
form of our languages. The pure subject-predicate form is sup- 
posed to be a € f(x), where “a” is the name of an object. Now let’s 
look for an application of this schema. The first things that come to 
mind as “names of objects” are the names of persons and of other 
spatial objects (the Koh-i-Noor). Such names are given by osten- 
sive definitions (“that 7, is called ‘N’ ”).Such a definition might be 
conceived as a rule substituting the word “N” for a gesture 
pointing to the object, with the proviso that the gesture can 
always be used in place of the name. Thus, I may have explained 
“this man is called ‘N’”, and I go on to say “ ‘N’ is a mathema- 
tician”’, “N is lazy’’, and in each of these sentences I might have 
said “this man” (with the ostensive gesture) instead of “N’’. (In 
that case, incidentally it would have been better to phrase the 
ostensive definition “this man is called‘N’ ”! or “I want to call this 
man ‘N’ ”, because the version above is also the proposition that 
this man bears this name). 

However, this isn’t the normal way of using a name; it is an 
essential feature of the normal use that I can’t fall back on to a 
sign of the gesture language in place of the name. That’s to say, in 
the way in which we use the name “‘N”’, if N goes out of the room 
and later a man comes into the room it makes sense to ask whether 


1. There appears to be something wrong with the German text here. Possibly 
Wittgenstein meant to write “let this man be called ‘N’” and inadvertently 
wrote a version which is the same as the one he is correcting. (Trs.) 


202 


this man is N, whether he is the same man as the one who left the 
room earlier. And the sentence “‘N has come back into the room”’ 
only makes sense if I can decide the question. And its sense will 
vary with the criterion for this being the object that I earlier called 
‘N’. Different kinds of criteria will make different rules hold for 
the sign ‘N’, will make it a ‘name’ in a different sense of the 
word. Thus the word ‘name’ and the corresponding word ‘object 
are each headings to countless different lists of rules. 

If we give names to spatial objects, our use of such names 
depends ona criterion of identity which presupposes the impenetra- 
bility of bodies and the continuity of their movement. So if I 
could treat two bodies A and B as J can treat their shadows on the 
wall, making two into one and one into two again, it would be 
senseless to ask which of the two after the division is A and which 
is B, unless I go on to introduce a totally new criterion of identity 
e.g. the direction of their movements. (There is a rule for the name 
of a river arising from the confluence of two rivers, thus: 


NN 


—> — A 


> 


A 


The resulting river takes the name of that source in whose approxi- 
mate direction it flows onward.) 

Think of the possible criteria of identity for things like colour 
patches in my visual field (or figures on a cinema screen) and of the 
different kinds of use of names given to such patches or figures. 

If we turn to the form of expression “(4x) . fx” it’s clear that this 
is a sublimation of the form of expression in our language: “There 
are human beings on this island” “There are stars that we do not 
see”. To every proposition of the form “‘(4x) . fx” there is supposed 
to correspond a proposition “fa”, and “a” is supposed to be a 
name. So one must be able to say “(4x).fx, namely a and b”, 


203 


(“There are some values of x, which satisfy fx, namely a and b’’), 
or “(3x).fx, e.g. a”, etc. And this is indeed possible in a case like 
“There are human beings on this island, namely Messrs A, B, C, 
D.” But then is it essential to the sense of the sentence ““There are 
men on this island” that we should be able to name them, and fix 
a particular criterion for their identification ? That is only so in the 
case where the proposition “(4x).fx” is defined as a disjunction of 
propositions of the form “f(x)’, if e.g. it is laid down that ‘There 
are men on this island” means “Either Mr. A or Mr. B or Mr. C 
ot Mr. D. or Mr. E is on this island” — if, that is, one determines 
the concept “man” extensionally (which of course is quite contrary 
to the normal use of this word.) (On the other hand the concept 
“primary colour” really is determined extensionally.) 

So it doesn’t always make sense when presented with a propo- 
sition “(4x).fx” to ask “Which xs satisfy f?”? “Which red circle a 
centimetre across is in the middle of this square” ? - One mustn’t 
confuse the question “which object satisfies f>” with the question 
“what sort of object . . .etc.?”? The first question would have to be 
answered by a name, and so the answer would have to be able to 
take the form “f(a)”; the question “what sort of . . .?” is answered 
by “(ax).fx.px”. So it may be senseless to ask “which red spot 
do you see?” and yet make sense to ask “what kind of a red spot 
do you see (a round one, a square one, etc.) >” 


I would like to say: the old logic contains more convention and 
physics than has been realised. Ifa noun is the name of a body, a verb 
is to denote a movement, and an adjective to denote a property of a 
body, it is easy to see how much that logic presupposes; and it is 
reasonable to conjecture that those original presuppositions go 
still deeper into the application of the words, and the logic of 
propositions. 


(Suppose we were set the task of projecting figures of various 
shapes on a given plane I into a plane Hl. We could then fix a 


204 


method of projection (say orthogonal projection) and carry out the 
mapping in accordance with it. We could also easily make in- 
ferences from the representations on plane I about the figures on 
plane I. But we could also adopt another procedure: we might 
decide that the representations in the second plane should all be 
circles, no matter what the copied figures in the first plane might be. 
(Perhaps this is the most convenient form of representation for 
us.) That is, different figures on I are mapped onto I by different 
methods of projection. In order in this case to construe the circles 
in II as representations of the figures in I, I shall have to give the 
method of projection for each circle; the mere fact that a figure in I 
is represented as a circle in II! by itself tells us nothing about the 
shape of the figure copied. That an image in II is a circle is just the 
established norm of our mapping. — Well, the same thing happens 
when we depict reality in our language in accordance with the 
subject-predicate form. The subject-predicate form serves as a 
projection of countless different logical forms. 


Frege’s “Concept and Object” is the same as subject and predi- 
cate. 


If a table is painted brown, then it’s easy to think of the wood as 
bearer of the property brown and you can imagine what remains the 
same when the colour changes. Even in the case of one particular 
circle which appears now red, now blue. It is thus easy to imagine 
what is red, but difficult to imagine what is circular. What remains 
in this case if form and colour alter? For position is part of the 
form and it is arbitrary for me to lay down that the centre should 
stay fixed and the only changes in form be changes in the radius, 

We must once more adhere to ordinary language and say that a 
patch is circular. 

It is clear that here the phrase “bearer of a property” in this 
context conveys a completely wrong — an impossible — picture. 
If I havea lump of clay, I can consider it as the bearer of a form, and 
that, roughly, is where this picture comes from. 


1. I have here corrected an inadvertent transposition of “I” and “IT” in 
Wittgenstein’s German. (Trts.) 


205 


“The patch changes its form” and “the lump of clay changes its 
form” are different forms of propositions. 


You can say “Measure whether shat is a circle” or “See whether 
that ovet there is a hat’’. You can also say “Measure whether that 
is a circle or an ellipse”, but not “. .. whether that is a circle or a 
hat’’; nor “‘See whether that is a hat or red’’. 


If I point to a curve and say ‘““That is a circle” then someone can 
object that if it were not a circle it would no longer be shat. That is 
to say, what I mean by the word “‘that”’ must be independent of 
what J assert about it. 

(‘Was that thunder, or gunfire ?”’ Here you could not ask “Was 
that a noise P’’) 


How are two circles of the same size distinguished? This 
question makes it sound as if they were pretty nearly one circle 
and only distinguished by a nicety. 

In the technique of representation by equations what is common 
is expressed by the form of the equation, and the difference by the 
difference in the coordinates of the centres. 

So it is as if what corresponds with the objects falling under the 
concept were here the coordinates of the centres. 

Couldn’t you then say, instead of “This is a circle’’, ‘“This point is 
the centre of a circle” ? For to be the centre of a circle is an external 
property of the point. 


What is necessary to a description that — say —-a book is in a 
certain position ? The internal description of the book, i.e. of the 
concept, and a description of its place which it would be possible 
to give by giving the co-ordinates of three points. The proposition 
“Such a book is here”? would mean that it had shese three co-ordin- 
ates. For the specification of the “here”? must not prejudge what 
is here. 

But doesn’t it come to the same thing whether I say “This is a 
book” or “Here is a book”’? The proposition would then amount 


206 


to saying, ‘“These are three corners of such a book”’. 

Similarly you can also say ‘“‘This circle is the projection of a 
sphere”’ or “This is a man’s appearance”. 

All that Iam saying comes to this, that ®(x) must be an external 
description of x. 

If in this sense J now say in three-dimensional space ‘Here is a 
circle’ and on another occasion “Here is a sphere” are the two 
“there’s” of the same type? I want to ask: can one significantly 
say of the same ‘object’: it is a circle, and: it is a sphere? Is the 
subject of each of these predicates of the same type ? Both could be 
the three coordinates of the relevant centre-point. But the position 
of the circle in three-dimensional space is not fixed by the coordin- 
ates of its centre. 


On the other hand you can of course say “It’s not the noise, but 
the colour that makes me nervous” and here it might look as if a 
variable assumed a colour and a noise as values. (“Sounds and 
colours can be used as vehicles of communication”’.) It is clear that 
this proposition is of the same kind as “‘if you hear a shot, or see me 
wave, run’’. For this is the kind of co-ordination on the basis of 
which a heard or seen language functions. 


“Ts it conceivable that two things have all their properties in 
common ?” ~ If it isn’t conceivable, then neither is its opposite. 


We do indeed talk about a circle, its diameter, etc. etc., as if 
we were describing a concept in complete abstraction from the 
objects falling under it. — But in that case ‘circle’ is not a predicate 
in the original sense. And in general geometry is the place where 
concepts from the most different regions get mixed up together. 


207 


3 
Objects 


“In a certain sense, an object cannot be described.” (So too 
Plato: “You can’t give an account of one but only name it.”’) 
Here “‘object”’ means “‘reference of a not further definable word”, 
and “description” or “explanation” really means: “definition”. 
For of course it isn’t denied that the object can be “described from 
outside’’, that properties can be ascribed to it and so on. 


So when we use the proposition above we are thinking of a 
calculus with signs or names that are indefinable - or, more 
accurately, undefined — and we are saying that no account can be 
given of them. 


“What a word means a proposition cannot tell.” 


What is the distinction, then, between blue and red? 

We aren’t of the opinion that one colour has one property and 
the other another. In any case, the properties of blue and red are 
that this body (or place) is blue, and that other is red. 


When asked “what is the distinction between blue and red?” 
we feel like answering: one is blue and the other red. But of course 
that means nothing and in reality what we’re thinking of is the 
distinction between the surfaces or places that have these colours. 
For otherwise the question makes no sense at all. 


Compare the different question: “What is the distinction between 
orange and pink?” One is a mixture of yellow and red, the other a 
mixture of white and red. And we may say accordingly: blue 
comes from purple when it gets more bluish, and red comes from 
purple when that gets more and more reddish. 


208 


So what I am saying means: red can’t be described. But can’t we 
represent it in painting by painting something red ? 


No, that isn’t a representation in painting of the meaning of the 
word ‘red’ (there’s no such thing). 
The portrait of red. 


Still, it’s no accident that in order to define the meaning of the 
word “red” the natural thing is to point to a red object. 


(What is natural about it is portrayed in that sentence by the 
double occurrence of the word ‘red’). 


To say that blue is on the bluish side of blue-red and red on the 
reddish side is a grammatical sentence and therefore akin to a 
definition. And indeed one can also say: more bluish = more like 
blue. 


“If you call the colour green an object, you must be saying that 
it is an object that occurs in the symbolism. Otherwise the sense of 
the symbolism, and thus its very existence as a symbolism, would 
not be guaranteed.” 

But what does that assert about green, or the word “‘green’’? 
((That sentence is connected with a particular conception of the 
meaning-telation and a particular formulation of the problem the 
relation raises)). 


209 


4 
Elementary Propositions 


A} 


Can a logical product be hidden in a proposition? And if so, 
how does one tell, and what methods do we have of bringing the 
hidden element of a proposition to light? If we haven’t yet got a 
method, then we can’t speak of something being hidden or 
possibly hidden. And if we do have a method of discovery then 
the only way in which something like a logical product can be 
hidden in a proposition is the way in which a quotient like 75 3/3 is 
hidden until the division has been carried out. 

The question whether a logical product is hidden in a sentence 
is a mathematical problem. 


So an elementary proposition is a proposition which, in the 
calculus as I am now using it, is not represented as a truth-function 
of other sentences. 


The idea of constructing elementary propositions (as e.g. 
Carnap has tried to do) rests on a false notion of logical analysis. 
It is not the task of that analysis to discover a ¢heory of elementary 
propositions, like discovering principles of mechanics. 


My notion in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus was wrong: 
1) because I wasn’t clear about the sense of the words “a logical 
product is Aidden in a sentence” (and suchlike), 2) because I too 
thought that logical analysis had to bring to light what was hidden 
(as chemical and physical analysis does). 


The proposition “‘this place is now red” (or “this circle is now 
red’’) can be called an elementary proposition if this means that it is 


1. From the 1932(?) typescript where it appears as a chapter by itself. 


210 


neither a truth-function of other propositions nor defined as such. 
(Here I am disregarding combinations such as p.: qv ~ q and the 
like.) 

But from “a is now red” there follows “a is now not green” 
and so elementary propositions in this sense aren’t independent 
of each other like the elementary propositions in the calculus I 
once described —a calculus to which, misled as I was by a false 
notion of reduction, I thought that the whole use of propositions 
must be reducible. 


B! 


If you want to use the appellation “elementary proposition” as 
I did in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, and as Russell used 
“atomic proposition”, you may call the sentence “Here there is a 
red rose” an elementary proposition. That is to say, it doesn’t 
contain a truth-function and it isn’t defined by an expression which 
contains one. But if we’re to say that a proposition isn’t an ele- 
mentary proposition unless its complete logical analysis shows 
that it isn’t built out of other propositions by truth-functions, we 
are presupposing that we have an idea of what such an ‘analysis’ 
would be. Formerly, I myself spoke of a ‘complete analysis’, and 
T used to believe that philosophy had to give a definitive dissection 
of propositions so as to set out clearly all their connections and 
remove all possibilities of misunderstanding. I spoke as if there was 
a calculus in which such a dissection would be possible. I vaguely 
had in mind something like the definition that Russell had given 
for the definite article, and I used to think that in a similar way one 
would be able to use visual impressions etc. to define the concept 
say of a sphere, and thus exhibit once for all the connections 
between the concepts and lay bare the source of all misunder- 
standings, etc. At the root of all this there was a false and idealized 
picture of the use of language. Of course, in particular cases one can

years after the main text of this volume.

clarify by definitions the connections between the different types 
of use of expressions. Such a definition may be useful in the case 
of the connection between ‘visual impression’ and ‘sphere’, 
But for this purpose it is not a definition of the concept of a physical 
sphere that we need; instead we must describe a language game 
telated to our own, or rather a whole series of related language 
games, and it will be in these that such definitions may occur. 
Such a contrast destroys grammatical prejudices and makes it 
possible for us to see the use of a word as it really is, instead of 
inventing the use for the word. 


There could perhaps be a calculus for dissecting propositions; it 
isn’t hard to imagine one. Then it becomes a problem of calculation 
to discover whether a proposition is or is not an elementary 
proposition. 

The question whether e.g. a logical product is hidden in a sen- 
tence is a mathematical problem. - What “hidden” means here 
is defined by the method of discovery (or, as it might be, by the 
lack of a method). 


What gives us the idea that there is a kind of agreement between 
thought and reality ? — Instead of “agreement” here one might say 
with a clear conscience “‘pictorial character”’.! 


But is this pictorial character an agreement? In the Tvactatus 


‘ Logico-Philosophicus I said something like: it is an agreement of 


form. But that is an error. 


First of all, “picture” here is ambiguous. One wants to say that 
an order is the picture of the action which was carried out on the 
order; but also, a picture of the action which #s ¢o be carried out as 
an order. 


1. Cf p. 163. 


We may say: a blueprint serves as a picture of the object which the 
workman is to make from it. 

And here we might call the way in which the workman turns 
such a drawing into an artefact “the method of projection”. We 
might now express ourselves thus: the method of projection 
mediates between the drawing and the object, it reaches from the 
drawing to the artefact. Here we are comparing the method of 
projection with projection lines which go from one figure to 
another. — But if the method of projection is a bridge, it is a bridge 
which isn’t built until the application is made. — This comparison 
conceals the fact that the picture p/us the projection lines leaves 
open various methods of application; it makes it look as if what is 
depicted, even if it does not exist in fact, is determined by the 
picture and the projection lines in an ethereal manner; every bit 
as determined, that is to say, as if it did exist. (It is ‘determined 
give or take a yes or no.’) In that case what we may call ‘picture’ 
is the blueprint plus the method of its application. And we now 
imagine the method as something which is attached to the blue- 
print whether or not it is used. (One can “describe” an application 
even if it doesn’t exist). 


Now I would like to ask ““How can the blueprint be used as a 
representation, unless there is already an agreement with what is 
to be made?” —- But what does that mean? Well, perhaps this: 
how could I play the notes in the score on the piano if they didn’t 
already have a relationship to particular types of movement of the 
hand ? Of course such a relationship sometimes consists in a certain 
agreement, but sometimes not in any agreement, but merely in 
our having learnt to apply the signs in a particular way. What the 
comparison between the method of projection and the projection 
lines connecting the picture with the object does is to make all 
these cases alike — because shat is what attracts us. You may say: 
I count the projection lines as part of the picture — but not the 
method of projection. 


1. Cf, Tractatus 2. 1513 (Editor). 


213 


You may of course also say: I count a description of a method of 
projection as part of the picture. 

So I am imagining that the difference between proposition and 
reality is ironed out by the lines of projection belonging to the 
picture, the thought, and that no further room is left for a method 
of application, but only for agreement and disagreement.

Is time essential to propositions ? 


Comparison between time and truth-functions 


If we had grammar set out in the form of a book, it wouldn’t 
be a series of chapters side by side, it would have quite a different 
structure. And it is here, if I am right, that we would have to see 
the distinction between phenomenological and non-phenomeno- 
logical. There would be, say, a chapter about colours, setting out 
the rules for the use of colour-words; but there would be nothing 
comparable in what the grammar had to say about the words 
“not”, “or”, etc. (the “logical constants’’). 

It would, for instance, be a consequence of the rules, that these 
latter words unlike the colour words were usable in every propo- 
sition; and the generality belonging to this “every” would not be 
the kind that is discovered by experience, but the generality of a 
supreme rule of the game admitting of no appeal. 


How does the temporal character of facts manifest itself? How 
does it express itself, if not by certain expressions having to occur 
in our sentences? That means: how does the temporal character 
of facts express itself, if not grammatically ? “Temporal character” 
~ that doesn’t mean that I come at 5 o’clock, but that I come at 
some time or other, i.e. that my proposition has the structure it has. 


Weare inclined to say that negationand disjunction are connected 
with the nature of the proposition, but that time is connected with 
its content rather than with its nature. 

But if two things are equally universal, how can it show itself 
in grammar that one of them is connected with the nature of the 
Ptoposition and the other is not? 

Or should I have said that time is not equally universal since 
mathematical propositions can be negated and occur in dis- 
junctions, without being temporal? There is indeed a connection 
here, though this form of portraying the matter is misleading. 


215 


But that shows what I mean by “proposition.” or “‘nature of the 
proposition”. 


Why — I want to ask — is the temporal character of propositions 
so universal ? 

Might one also put the question thus: “How does it happen 
that every fact of experience can be brought into a relationship 
with what is shown by a clock ?” 


Having two kinds of generality in the way I spoke of would be as 
strange as if there were two equally exceptionless rules of a game 
and one of them were pronounced to be more fundamental. As if 
one could ask whether in chess the king or the chess board was 
more important; which of the two was mote essential, and which 
more accidental. 


There’s at least one question that seems in order: suppose I had 
written up the grammar, and the different chapters on the colour 
words, etc. etc. were there one after the other, like rules for each 
of the chess pieces, how would I know that those were a// the 
chapters ? If there turns out to be a common property in all the 
chapters so far in existence, we seem to have encountered a 
logical generality that is not an essential, i.e. a priori generality. 
But we can’t say that the fact that chess is played with 16 pieces is 
any less essential to it than its being played on a chessboard. 


Since time and the truth-functions taste so different, and since 
they manifest their nature only and wholly in grammar, it is 
grammar that must explain the different taste. 

One tastes like content, the other like form of representation. 

They taste as different as a plan and a line through a plan. 


216 


It appears to me that the present, as it occurs in the proposition 
“the sky is blue” (if this proposition isn’t meant as a hypothesis), 
is not a form of time, so that the present in /4is sense is atemporal. 


Does time enter into a landscape picture ? or into a still life ? 
Literature consisting of descriptions of landscapes. 


It is noteworthy that the time of which Iam here speaking is not 
time in a physical sense. We are not concerned with measuring time. 
It is fishy that something which is unconnected with measurement 
is supposed to have a role in propositions like that of physical time 
in the hypotheses of physics. 


Discuss: 

The distinction between the logic of the content and the logic 
of the propositional form in general. The former seems, so to 
speak, brightly coloured, and the latter plain; the former seems to 
be concerned with what the picture represents, the latter to be a 
characteristic of the pictorial form like a frame. 


By comparison with the way in which the truth-functions are 
applicable to all propositions,. it seems to us accidental that all 
propositions contain time in some way or other. 

The former seems to be connected with their nature as propo- 
sitions, the latter with the nature of the reality we encounter.

A sentence can contain time in very different senses.

The Nature of Hypotheses 


You could obviously explain an hypothesis by means of pictures. 
I mean, you could e.g. explain the hypothesis “there is a book lying 
here’’ with pictures showing the book in plan, elevation and various 
cross-sections. 


Such a representation gives a /aw. Just as the equation of a 
curve gives a law, by means of which you may discover the ordin- 
ates, if you cut at different abscissae. 

In which case the verifications of particular cases correspond to 
cuts that have actually been made. 

If our experiences yield points lying on a straight line, the 
proposition that these experiences are various views of a straight 
line is an hypothesis. 

The hypothesis is a way of representing this reality, for a new 
experience may tally with it or not, or possibly make it necessary 
to modify the hypothesis. 


If for instance we use a system of coordinates and the equation 
for a sphere to express the proposition that a sphere is located at a 
certain distance from our eyes, this description has a greater 
multiplicity than that of a verification by eye. The first multi- 
plicity corresponds not to one verification but to a /aw obeyed by 
verifications. 


An hypothesis is a law for forming propositions. 

You could also say: an hypothesis is a law for forming expecta- 
tions. 

A proposition is, so to speak, a particular cross-section of an 
hypothesis. 


According to my principle two suppositions must have the same 
sense if every possible experience that confirms the one also con- 


219 


firms the other, if, that is, no decision between the two is con- 
ceivable on the basis of experience. 


The representation of a curve as a straight line with deviations. 
The equation of the curve includes a parameter whose course 
expresses the deviations from a straight line. It isn’t essential 
that these deviations should be “slight”. They can be so large that 
the curve doesn’t look like a straight line at all. “Straight line with 
deviations” is only one form of description. It makes it easier for 
me to eliminate, or neglect, a particular component of the descrip- 
tion if I so wish. (The form “rule with exceptions”). 


What does it mean, to be certain that one has toothache? (If one 
can’t be certain, then grammar doesn’t allow the use of the word 
“certain” in this connection.) 

The grammar of the expression “‘to be certain”. 


We say “If I say that I see a chair there, I am saying more than 
I know for certain”. And commonly that means “But all the same, 
there’s one thing that I do know for certain.” But if we now try to 
say what it is, we find ourselves in a certain embarrassment. 

“T see something brown — that is certain.” That’s meant to say 
that the brown colour is seen and not perhaps merely conjectured 
from other symptoms. And we do indeed say quite simply: “I see 
something brown.” 


If someone tells me “Look into this telescope, and make me a 
sketch of what you see”, the sketch I make is the expression of a 
proposition, not of a hypothesis. 


If I say “‘Here there is a chair”, I mean more — people say — than 
the mere description of what I perceive. This can only mean that 
that proposition doesn’t have to be true, even though the descrip- 
tion fits what is seen. Well, in what circumstances would I say 
that that proposition wasn’t true? Apparently, if certain other 


220 


propositions aren’t true that were implicit in the first. But it isn’t 
as if the first turns out to have been a logical product all along. 


The best comparison for every hypothesis, — something that is 
itself an example of an hypothesis —is a body in relation to a 
systematic series of views of it from different angles. 


Making a discovery in a scientific investigation (say in experi- 
mental physics) is of course not the same thing as making a 
discovery in ordinary life outside the laboratory; but the two are 
similar and a comparison with the former can throw light on the 
latter. 


There is an essential distinction between propositions like 
“That isalion’’, “The sunis larger than the earth”, and propositions 
like “Men have two hands”’. Propositions like the first pair con- 
tain a “this”, “now”, “here” and thus connect immediately with 
reality. But if there happened to be no men around, how would I 
go about checking the third proposition? 


It is always single faces of hypotheses that are verified. 

Perhaps this is how it is: what an hypothesis explains is itself 
only expressible by an hypothesis. Of course, this amounts to 
asking whether there are any primary propositions that are 
definitively verifiable and not merely facets of an hypothesis. 
(That is rather like asking: are there surfaces that aren’t surfaces 


of bodies ?) 


At all events, there can’t be any distinction between an hypo- 
thesis used as an expression of an immediate experience and a 
proposition in the stricter sense. 


There is a distinction between a proposition like “‘Here there is a 
sphere in front of me” and “It looks as if there is a sphere in front 
of me’’. The same thing shows itself also thus: one can say “There 
seems to be a sphere in front of me’’, but it is senseless to say “It 
looks as if there seems to be a sphere here”’. So too one can say 


221 


“Here there is probably a sphere’’, but not “‘Here there probably 
appears to bea sphere’’. In such a case people would say ‘‘After all, 
you must know whether there appears to be”. 


There is nothing hypothetical in what connects the proposition 
with the given fact. 


It’s clear that reality-I mean immediate experience — will 
sometimes give an hypothesis the answer yes, and sometimes the 
answer no (here of course the “yes” and “no” express only con- 
firmation and lack of confirmation); and it’s clear that these 
affirmations and denials can be given expression. 


The hypothesis, if that face of it is laid against reality, becomes a 
proposition. 


It may be doubtful whether the body I see is a sphere, but it 
can’t be doubtful that from here it looks to be something like a 
sphere. - The mechanism of hypothesis would not function if 
appearance too were doubtful so that one couldn’t verify beyond 
doubt even a facet of the hypothesis. If there were a doubt here, 
what could take the doubt away ? If this connection too were loose, 
there would be no such thing as confirming an hypothesis and it 
would hang entirely in the air, quite pointless (and therefore 
senseless). 


If I say “I saw a chair’, that (in ove sense) isn’t contradicted by 
the proposition “‘there wasn’t one there”. For I could use the first 
proposition in the description of a dream and then nobody would 
use the second to contradict me. But the description of the dream 
throws a light on the sense of the words “I saw”’. 

Again, in the proposition “there wasn’t one there’, the word 
“there” may have more than one meaning. 


222 


I am in agreement with the opinions of contemporary physicists 
when they say that the signs in their equations no longer have any 
“meanings” and that physics cannot attain to any such meanings, 
but must stay put at the signs. But they don’t see that the signs have 
meaning in as much as—and only in as much as — observable 
phenomena do or do not correspond to them, in however circuitous 
a manner. 


Let us imagine that chess had been invented not as a board game, 
but as a game to be played with numbers and letters on paper, so 
that no one had ever imagined a board with 64 squares in connec- 
tion with it. And now suppose someone made the discovery that 
the game corresponded exactly to a game which could be played 
ona board in such and such a way. This discovery would have been 
a great simplification of the game (people who would earlier have 
found it too difficult could now play it). But it is clear that this new 
illustration of the rules of the game would be nothing more than 
anew, mote easily surveyable symbolism, which in other respects 
would be on the same level as the written game. Compare with this 
the talk about physics nowadays not working with mechanical 
models but “only with symbols”.

Probability 


The probability of an hypothesis has its measure in how much 
evidence is needed to make it profitable to throw it out. 

It’s only in this sense that we can say that repeated uniform 
experience in the past renders the continuation of this uniformity 
in the future probable. 

If, in this sense, I now say: I assume the sun will rise again 
tomorrow, because the opposite is so unlikely, I here mean by 
“likely” and “unlikely” something completely different from what 
I mean by these words in the proposition “It’s equally likely that 
T’ll throw heads or tails”. The two meanings of the word “likely” 
are, to be sure, connected in certain ways, but they aren’t identical. 


We only give up an hypothesis for an ever higher gain. 


Induction is a process based on a principle of economy. 


The question how simple a representation is yielded by assum- 
ing a particular hypothesis is directly connected, I believe, with 
the question of probability. 


We may compare a part of an hypothesis with the movement of a 
part of a gear, a movement that can be stipulated without preju- 
dicing the intended motion. But then of course you have to make 
appropriate adjustments to the rest of the gear if it is to produce 
the desired motion. I’m thinking of a differential gear. - Once I’ve 
decided that there is to be no deviation from a certain part of my 
hypothesis no matter what the experience to be described may be, 
I have stipulated a mode of representation and this part of my 
hypothesis is now a postulate. 


224 


A postulate must be such that no conceivable experience can 
refute it, even though it may be extremely inconvenient to cling 
to the postulate. To the extent to which we can talk here of greater 
or slighter convenience, there is a greater or slighter probability 
of the postulate. 


It’s senseless to talk of a measure for this probability at this 
juncture. The situation here is like that in the case of two kinds of 
numbers where we can with a certain justice say that the one is 
more like the other (is closer to it) than a third, but there isn’t any 
numerical measure of the similarity. Of course you could imagine a 
measure being constructed in such cases, too, say by counting the 
postulates or axioms common to the two systems, etc. etc. 


I give someone the following piece of information, and no more: 
at such and such a time you will see a point of light appear in the 
interval AB. 

A C B 


py 


Does the question now makes sense “Is it more likely that this 
point will appear in the interval AC than in CB’’? I believe, ob- 
viously not. —I can of course decide that the probability of the 
event’s happening in CB is to be in the ratio CB/AC to the proba- 


225 


bility of its happening in AC; however, that’s a decision I can have 
empirical grounds for making, but about which there is nothing 
to be said @ priori. It is possible for the observed distribution of 
events not to lead to this assumption. The probability, where in- 
finitely many possibilities come into consideration, must of course 
be treated as a limit. That is, if I divide the stretch AB into arbi- 
trarily many parts of arbitrary lengths and regard it as equally 
likely that the event should occur in any one of these parts, we 
immediately have the simple case of dice before us. And now I 
can — arbitrarily — lay down a law for constructing parts of equal 
likelihood. For instance, the law that, if the lengths of the parts are 
equal, they are equally likely. But any other law is just as permis- 
sible. 

Couldn’t I, in the case of dice too, take, say, five faces together 
as one possibility, and oppose them to the sixth as the second 
possibility ? And what, apart from experience, is there to prevent 
me from regarding these two possibilities as equally likely ? 

Let’s imagine throwing, say, a red ball with just one very small 
green patch on it. Isn’t it much more likely in this case for the red 
area to strike the ground than for the green? — But how would we 
support this proposition? Presumably by showing that when we 
throw the ball, the red strikes the ground much more often than the 
green. But that’s got nothing to do with logic. - We may always 
project the red and green surfaces and what befalls them onto a 
surface in such a way that the projection of the green surface is 
greater than or equal to the red; so that the events, as seen in this 
projection, appear to have a quite different probability ratio from 
the one they had on the original surface. If, e.g. I reflect the events 


226 


in a suitably curved mirror and now imagine what I would have 
held to be the more probable event if I had only seen the image in 


the mirror. 
The one thing the mirror can’t alter is the number of clearly 


demarcated possibilities. So that if I have n coloured patches on 
my bail, the mirror will also show n, and if I have decided that these 
are to be regarded as equally likely, then I can stick to this decision 
for the mirror image too. 

To make myself even clearer: if I carry out the experiment with 
a concave mirror, i.e. make the observations in a concave mirror, it 
will perhaps then look as if the ball falls more often on the small 
surface than on the much larger one; and it’s clear that neither 
experiment — in the mirror or outside it — has aclaim to precedence. 


We may apply our old principle to propositions expressing a 
probability and say, we shall discover their sense by considering 
what verifies them. 

If I say “That will probably occur”, is this proposition verified 
by the occurrence or falsified by its non-occurrence? In my 
opinion, obviously not. In that case it doesn’t say anything about 
either. For if a dispute were to arise as to whether it is probable or 
not, it would always be arguments from the past that would be 
adduced. And this would be so even when what actually happened 
was already known. 


Causality depends on an observed uniformity. This does not 
mean that a uniformity so far observed will always continue, but 
what cannot be altered is that the events so far have been uniform; 
that can’t be the uncertain result of an empirical series which in its 
turn isn’t something given but something dependent on another 
uncertain one and so on ad infinitum. 


When people say that the proposition “it is probable that p will 
occur” says something about the event p, they forget that the 
probability remains even when the event p does zof occut. 


227 


The proposition “p will probably occur’ does indeed say 
something about the future, but not something ‘“‘about the event 
p’, as the grammatical form of the statement makes us believe. 


If ask for the grounds of an assertion, the answer to the question 
holds not only for this person and for s4is action (assertion), but 
quite generally. 


If I say “‘the weather looks like rain” do I say anything about 
future weather? No; I say something about the present weather, 
by means of a law connecting weather at any given time with 
weather at an earlier time. This law must already be in existence, 
and we are using it to construct certain statements about our 
experience. — 

We might say the same of historical statements too. But I was 
too quick to say that the proposition “the weather looks like rain” 
says nothing about future weather. It all depends what is meant 
by “saying something about something’. The sentence says just 
what it says. 

The sentence “‘p will probably occur” says something about the 
future only in a sense in which its truth and falsehood are com- 
pletely independent of what will happen in the future. 


If we say: “the gun is now aiming at the point p” we aren’t 
saying anything about where the shot will hit. Giving the point 
at which it is aiming is a geometrical means of assigning its direction. 
That this is the means we use is certainly connected with certain 
observations (projectile parabolas, etc.) but these observations 
don’t enter into our present description of the direction. 


Parabola 


228 


A Galtonian photograph is the picture of a probability. 
The law of probability is the natural law you see when you 


screw up your eyes. 


“On average, the points yielded by the experiment lie on a 
straight line”. “Tf I throw with a good die, then on average I 
throw a one every six throws”’. What does that mean ? Is the propo- 
sition compatible with azy experience I may have? If so, it says 
nothing. Have I decided in advance which experiences are in- 
compatible with it and what is the limit beyond which exceptions 
may not go without upsetting the rule? No. But couldn’t I have 
set such a limit ? Of course. — Suppose that the limit had been set 
thus: if 4 out of 6 successive throws turn out the same, then it’s 
a bad die. Now someone says: “But if that happens only very 
seldom, mayn’t it be a good one after all?” - To that the answer is 
as follows. If I permit the turning up of 4 similar throws among 
6 successive ones to occur within a certain number of throws, 
then I am replacing the first limit with a different one. But if I say 
“any number of similar successive throws is allowed, as long as it 
happens sufficiently rarely”’, then strictly speaking I’ve defined the 
goodness of the die in a way that makes it independent of the 
result of the throws; unless by the goodness of a die I do not mean 
a property of the die, but a property of a particular game played 
with it. In that case I can certainly say: in any game I call the die 
good provided that among the N throws of the game there occur 
not more than log N similar successive throws. However, that 
doesn’t give a test for the checking of dice, but a criterion for 
judging a particular game. 


We say that if the die is quite regular and isn’t interfered with 
then the distribution of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 among the 
throws must be uniform, since there is no reason why one number 
should occur more often than another. 


229 


But now let’s represent the throws by the values of the function 
(x — 3)? for the arguments 1 to 6, i.e. by the numbers 0, 1, 4, 9 
instead of by the numbers 1 to 6. Is there a reason why one of these 
numbers should turn up in the new results more often than 
another? This shows us that the @ priori law of probability, like 
the minimum-principles of mechanics etc., is a form that laws may 
take. If it had been discovered by experiment that the distribution 
of the throws 1 to 6 with a regular die was such that the distribu- 
tion of the values of (x — 3)? was uniform, it would have been shis 
regularity that was defined as the a priori regularity. 

We do the same thing in the kinetic theory of gases: we represent 
the distribution of molecular movements in the form of some sort 
of uniform distribution; but we make the choice of what is uni- 
formly distributed — and in the other case of what is reduced to a 
minimum ~ in such a way that our theory agrees with experience. 


“The molecules move purely according to the laws of proba- 
bility” is supposed to mean: physics gets out of the way, and now 
the molecules move as it were purely according to laws of logic. 
This idea is similar to the idea that the law of inertia is an @ priori 
proposition: there too one speaks of what a body does when it 
isn’t interfered with. But what is the criterion for its not being 
interfered with ? Is it ultimately that it moves uniformly ina straight 
line ? Or is it something different ? If the latter, then it’s a matter of 
experience whether the law of inertia holds; if the former, then it 
wasn’t a law at all but a definition. So too with the proposition, “if 
the particles aren’t interfered with, then the distribution of their 
motions is such and such”. What is the criterion for their not 
being interfered with? etc. 


To say that the points yielded in this experiment lie roughly on 


this line, e.g. a straight line, means something like: “seen for this 
distance, they seem to lie on a straight line”. 


230 


I may say that a stretch gives the general impression of a straight 
line; but I cannot say: “This bit of line looks straight, for it could 
be a bit of a line that as a whole gives me the impression of being 
straight.” (Mountains on the earth and moon. The earth a ball.) 


Anexperiment with dice lasts a certain time, and our expectations 
about future throws can only be based on tendencies we observe in 
what happens during this experiment. That is to say, the experi- 
ment can only give grounds for expecting that things will go in iz 
the way shown by the experiment; but we can’t expect that the 
experiment, if continued, will now yield results that tally better 
with a preconceived idea of its course than did those of the ex- 
periment we have actually performed. So if, for instance, I toss a 
coin and find no tendency in the results of the experiment itself 
for the number of heads and tails to approximate to each other 
more closely, then the experiment gives me no reason to suppose 
that if it were continued such an approximation would emerge. 
Indeed, the expectation of such an approximation must i/se/f refer 
to a definite point in time, since we can’t say we’re expecting some- 
thing to happen eventually, in the infinite future. 


Any “reasonable expectation” is an expectation that a rule we 
have observed up to now will continue to hold. 

(But the rule must have been observed and can’t, for its part too, 
be merely expected.) 


The logic of probability is only concerned with the state of 
expectation in the sense in which logic in general is concerned with 
thinking. 


A ray is emitted from the light source S striking the surface AB 
to form a point of light there, and then striking the surface AB’. 
We have no reason to suppose that the point on AB lies to the 
left or to the right of M, and equally none for supposing that the 


point on AB’ lies on one side or the other of m. This yields therefore 
incompatible probabilities. But if I make an assumption about the 
probability of the point on AB lying in AM, how is this assumption 
verified ? Surely, we think, by a frequency experiment. Supposing 
this confirms the view that the probabilities of AM and BM are 
equal (and so the probabilities of Am and B’m differ), then it is 
recognized as the right one and thus shows itself to be an hypo- 
thesis belonging to physics. The geometrical construction merely 
shows that the fact that AM = MB was zo ground for assuming 
equal likelihood. 


Suppose that measurement shows the die to be accurate and 
regular, that the numbers on its sides don’t influence the throws, 
and that it is thrown by a hand whose movements follow no 
definite rules: does it follow that the distribution among the 
throws of each of the throws from 1 to 6 will be uniform on 
average? Where is the uniform distribution supposed to come 
from? The accuracy and regularity of the die can’t establish that the 
distribution of throws will be aniform on average. (It would be, as it 
were, a monochrome premise with a mottle conclusion.) And we 


232 


haven’t made any suppositions about the movements while 
throwing. (Making the bundles of hay equal gives reason to 
believe that the donkey will starve to death between them; it 
doesn’t give reason to believe that he will eat from each with 
roughly equal frequency.) —It is perfectly compatible with our 
assumptions for one hundred ones to be thrown in succession, if 
friction, hand-movements and air-resistance coincide appro- 
priately. The experimental fact that this never happens is a fact 
about those factors, and the hypothesis that the throws will be 
uniformly distributed is an hypothesis about the operation of 
those factors. 

Suppose someone says that a lever with arms of equal length must 
remain at rest under the influence of equal and opposite forces, 
since there is no cause to make it move to one side rather than to 
the other. That only means that if the lever moves to one side after 
we have ascertained the equality of the arms and the equal and 
opposite nature of the forces, then we can’t explain this on the 
basis of the preconditions we know or have assumed. (The form 
that we call “explanation”? must be asymmetrical: like the opera- 
tion which makes “‘2za + 3b” out of “a + b’’). But on the basis of 
our presuppositions we can indeed explain the lever’s continuance 
at rest.- Could we also explain a swing to left and right with 
roughly equal frequency? No, because once again the swing 
involves asymmetry; we would only explain the symmetry in this 
asymmetry. If the lever had rotated to the right with a uniform 
motion, one could similarly have said: given the symmetry of the 
conditions I can explain the uniformity of the motion, but not its 
direction. 

A lack of uniformity in the distribution of the throws is not to be 
explained by the symmetry of the die. It is only to this extent that 
the symmetry explains the uniformity of the distribution. — For 
one can of course say: if the numbers on the sides of the die have 
no effect, then the difference between them cannot explain an 
irregularity in the distribution; and of course similar citcum- 
stances can’t explain differences; and so to that extent one might 
infer a regularity. But in that case why is there any difference at 


233 


all between different throws? Whatever explains that must also 
explain their approximate regularity. It’s just that the regularity 
of the die doesn’t interfere with that regularity. 


Suppose that a man throwing dice every day threw nothing but 
ones for a week, using dice that proved good by every other 
method of testing and that gave the usual results when thrown by 
others. Has he grounds, now, for supposing that there is a law of 
nature that he will always throw ones? Has he grounds for be- 
lieving that it will go on like this, or has he grounds for believing 
that this regularity can’t last much longer? Has he reason to 
abandon the game since it has become clear that he can only 
throw ones, or reason to play on since in these circumstances it is 
all the more probable that he will throw a higher number at the 
next throw? In actual fact, he will refuse to accept the regularity 
as a natural law: at least, it will have to go on for a long time 
before he will entertain the possibility. But why? I believe it is 
because so much of his previous experience in life speaks against 
there being a law of nature of such a sort, and we have — so to 
speak —to surmount all that experience, before embracing a 
totally new way of looking at things. 


If we infer from the relative frequency of an event its relative 
frequency in the future, we can of coutse only do that from the 
frequency which has in fact been so far observed. And not from 
one we have derived from observation by some process or other 
for calculating probabilities. For the probability we calculate is 
compatible with any frequency whatever that we actually observe, 
since it leaves the time open. 


When a gambler or insurance company is guided by probability, 
they aren’t guided by the probability calculus, since one can’t be 
guided by this on its own, because amything that happens can be 
reconciled with it: no, the insurance company is guided by a 


234 


frequency actually observed. And that, of course, is an absolute 
frequency.

The concept “about? 
Problem of the “heap” 


“He came from about there >.” 

“About ¢here is the brightest point of the horizon”’. 

“Make the plank about 2 m long”. 

In order to say this, must I know of limits which determine the 
margin of tolerance of this length ? Obviously not. Isn’t it enough 
e.g. to say “A margin of +1 cm is perfectly permissible; 2 would be 
too much”? — Indeed it’s an essential part of the sense of my 
proposition that I’m not in a position to give “precise’’ bounds to 
the margin. Isn’t that obviously because the space in which I am 
working here doesn’t have the same metric as the Euclidean one? 

Suppose one wanted to fix the margin of tolerance exactly by 
experiment, by altering the length, approaching the limits of the 
margin and asking in each case whether such a length would do or 
not. After a few shortenings one would get contradictory results: 
at one time a point would be described as being within the limits, 
and at another time a point closer in would be described as 
impermissible, each time perhaps with the remark that the answers 
were no longer quite certain. 


It is the same sort of uncertainty as occurs in giving the highest 
point of a curve. We just aren’t in Euclidean space and here there 
isn’t a highest point in the Euclidean sense. The answer will mean 
“The highest point is about shere”” and the grammar of the word 
“about” — in this context — is part of the geometry of our space. 


Surely it is like the way the butcher weighs things only to the 
nearest ounce, though that is arbitrary and depends on what are 
the customary counterweights. Here it is enough to know: it 
doesn’t weigh more than P, and it doesn’t weigh less than P). 
One might say: in principle giving the weight thus isn’t giving a 


236 


number, but an interval, and the intervals make up a discontinuous 
series. 


Yet one might say: ‘‘at all events keep w7thin + 1 cm’’, thus 
setting an arbitrary limit. — If someone now said “Right, but that 
isn’t the real limit of the permissible tolerance; so what is?” the 
answer would be e.g. “I don’t know of any; I only know that 
+2 is too much’. 

Imagine the following psychological experiment. 


aehfdc ; 81 


82 


The subject is shown curves g, g, with a straight line A drawn 
across them. I will call the section of this line between g, and g, a. 
Parallel to a we now draw b at an arbitrary distance and ask the 
subject whether he sees the section b as bigger than a, or cannot 
any longer distinguish between the two lengths. He replies that 
b seems bigger than a. Next we move closer to a, measuring 
half the distance from a to b and drawing c. “Do you see c as bigger 
than a?” “Yes.” — We halve the distance c-a and draw d. “Do you 
see d as bigger than ar” “Yes.” We halve a-d. “Do you see e as 
bigger than a?” — “No.” — So we halve e-d. “Do you see f as 
bigger than e?” ~ ““Yes.”? — So we halve e-f and draw h. We might 
approach the line a from the left hand side as well and then say 
that what corresponds in Euclidean space to a seen length a is not 
a single length but an interval of lengths, and in a similar way 
what corresponds to a single seen position of a line (say the pointer 
of aninstrument) is an interval of positions in Euclidean space; but 
this interval has no precise limits. That means: it is bounded not by 


237 


points, but by converging intervals which do not converge upon a 
point. (Like the series of binary fractions that we get by throwing 
heads and tails.) The special thing about two intervals which are 
bounded in this b/urred way instead of by points is that in certain 
cases the answer to the question whether they overlap or are 
quite distinct is “undecided”; and the question whether they 
touch, whether they have an end-point in common, is always a 
senseless one since they don’t have end-points at all. But one 
might say “‘they have de facto end-points’’, in the sense in which 
the development of x has a de facto end. There is of course 
nothing mysterious about this property of “blurred” intervals; 
the somewhat paradoxical character is explained by the double use 
of the word “‘interval’’. 

The case is the same as that of the double use of the word 
“chess” to mean at one time the totality of the currently valid 
chess rules, and at another time the game invented in Persia by 
N. N. which developed in such and such a way. In one case it is 
nonsensical to talk of a development of the rules of chess and in 
another not. What we mean by “the length of a measured section” 
may be either what results from a particular measurement which 
I carry out today at 5 o’clock — in that case there is no “ + etc.” for 
this assignment of length — or, something to which measurements 
approximate, etc.; in the two cases the word “length” is used with 
quite different grammars. So too the word “interval” if what I 
mean by an interval is at one time something fixed and at another 
time something in flux. 

But we must not be surprised that an interval should have such 
a strange property; for we’re now just using the word “interval” in 
a sense different from the usual one. And we can’t say that we have 
discovered new properties of certain intervals, any more than we 
would discover new properties of the king in chess if we altered 
the rules of the game while keeping the designation “chess” and 
“king”. (On the other hand cf. Brouwer on the law of excluded 
middle.)

I) the intervals are separate 
II) they are separate with a de facto contact 
III) undecided 
IV) undecided 
V) undecided 
VI) they overlap 
VII) they overlap 


So basically that experiment gives what we have called a 
“blurred” interval; on the other hand of course we could conceive 
experiments which would give a sharp interval instead. Suppose 
we moved a straight-edge from the starting position b, in the 
direction of a, keeping it parallel to b, until our subject began to 
display a particular reaction; in that case we could call the point 
at which the reaction first occurs the limit of our strip. Likewise 
we might of course call the result of a weighing “the weight of a 
body” and in that sense there would be an absolutely exact weigh- 
ing, that is, one whose result did not have the form“'W + w”’.. We 
would thus have altered the form of our expression, and we would 
have to say that the weight of bodies varied according to a law 
that was unknown to us. (The distinction between “absolutely 
exact” weighing and “essentially inexact weighing” is a grammati- 
cal distinction connected with two different meanings of the ex- 
pression “result of weighing”).

The indeterminacy of the word “heap”. I could give as a defi- 
nition: a body of a certain form and consistency etc. is a heap, if it 
has a volume of K cubic metres, or more; anything less than that I 
will call a heaplet. In that case there is no largest heaplet; that 
means, it is senseless to speak of a largest heaplet. Conversely, I 
could decide: whatever is bigger than K cubic metres is to be a 
heap, and in that case the expression “the smallest heap” has no 
meaning. But isn’t this distinction an idle one? Certainly — if by 
the volume we mean a result of measurement in the normal sense; 
for such a result has the form “V + v”. But otherwise the distinc- 
tion would be no more idle than the distinction between threescore 
apples and 61 apples. 


About the problem of the “heap”’: Here, as in similar cases, one 
might think that there is an official concept like the official length 
of a pace; say “‘A heap is anything that is bigger than half a cubic 
metre”. But this would still not be the concept we normally use. 
For that there exists no delimitation (and if we fix one, we are 
altering the concept); it is just that there are cases that we count as 
within the extension of the concept, and cases that we no longer 
count as within the extension of the concept. 


“Make me a heap of sand here.” — “Fine, that is certainly some- 
thing he would call a heap.” I was able to obey the command, so it 
was in order. But what about this command “Make me the smallest 
heap you would still call a heap”? I would say: that is nonsense; 
I can only determine a de facto upper and lower limit.

I LOGICAL INFERENCE 


Is it because we understand the propositions that we know that q entails p? 
Does a sense give rise to the entailment? 


p-q. =-p means “q follows from p”.

(Ax). fx v fa. = .(4x).fx, (4x).fx.fa. = .fa. How do I know that? 
(Because for the equation above I gave a kind of proof). One might 
say something like: “I just understand ‘(4x).fx’”’. (An excellent 
example of what “‘understand” means). 

But I might equally ask “How do I know that (4x).fx follows 
from fa?” and answer “because I understand ‘(4x) .fx’.” 

But really how do I know that it follows ? - Because that is the 


way I calculate. 


How doI know that (4x) . fx follows from fa? Is it that I as it were 
see behind the sign “(4x) .fx”, that I see the sense lying behind it and 
see from that that it follows from fa? Is shat what understanding 
is? 

No, what that equation expresses is a part of the understanding 
(that is thus unpacked before my eyes). 

Compare the idea that understanding is first of all grasping 
in a flash something which then has to be unpacked like that. 

If I say “I know that (4x).fx follows, because I understand it” 
that would mean, that when I understand it, I see something 
different from the sign I’m given, a kind of definition of the sign 
which gives rise to the entailment.

Isn’t it rather that the connection is set up and prescribed by the 
equations ? For there is no such thing as a hidden connection. 


(4x) .fx 


But, I used to think, mustn’t (4x). fx be a truth function of fa for 
that to be possible, for that connection to be possible ? 


For doesn’t (4x). Fx v Fa = (4x). fx simply say that fa is already 
contained in (4x).fx? Doesn’t it show the connection between 
the fa and the (4x) .fx? Not unless (4x). fx is defined as a logical sum 
(with fa as one of the terms of the sum). — If that is the case, then 
(4x) .fx is merely an abbreviation. 


In logic there is no such thing as a hidden connection. 
You can’t get behind the rules, because there isn’t any behind. 


fE.fa. = fa. Can one say: that is only possible if FE follows from 
fa? Or must one say: that settles that fE is to follow from fa? 


If the former, it must be the structure that makes it follow, say 
because fE is so defined as to have the appropriate structure. But 
can the entailment really be a kind of result of the visible structure 
of the signs, in the way that a physical reaction is the result of a 
physical property ? Doesn’t it rather always depend on stipulations 
like the equation fE.fa. = .fa? Can it be read off from p v q that 


244 


it follows from p, or only from the rules Russell gives for the truth- 
functions ? 


And why should the rule fE.fa. = .fa be an effect of another 
rule rather than being itself the primary rule? 


For what is “fE must somehow contain fa” supposed to mean ? 
It doesn’t contain it, in so far as we can work with fE without 
mentioning fa; but it does in so far as the rule fE.fa = .fa holds. 


But the idea is that fE.fa. = fa can only hold in virtue of a 
definition of fE. 


That is, I think, because otherwise it looks, wrongly, as if a 
further stipulation had been made about fF after it had already 
been introduced into the language. But in fact there isn’t any 
stipulation left for future experience to make. 


And the definition of fE in terms of “all particular cases” is no 
Jess impossible than the enumeration of a// rules of the form 
fE.fx. = fx, 


Indeed the individual equations fE.fx.= fx are just precisely an 
expression of this impossibility. 


If we are asked: but is it now really certain that it isn’t a different 
calculus being used, we can only say: if that means “don’t we use 
other calculi too in our real language?” I can only answer “I don’t 
know any others at present”. (Similarly, if someone asked “are 
these all the calculi of contemporary mathematics?” I might say 
“T don’t remember any others, but I can read it up and find out 
more exactly”). But the question cannot mean “can no other 
calculus be used ?”’ For how is the answer to that question to be 
discovered ? 

A calculus exists when one describes it. 


245 


Repeated Sart | 


Can one say ‘calculus’ is not a mathematical concept ? 


If I were to say “whether p follows from q must result from 
p and q alone”’: it would have to mean this: that p follows from 
q is a stipulation that determines the sense of p and q, not some 
extra truth that can be asserted about the sense of both of 
them. Hence one can indeed give rules of inference, but in doing so 
one is giving for the use of the written signs rules which determine 
their as yet undetermined sense; and that means simply that the 
rules must be laid down arbitrarily, i.e. are not to be read off from 
reality like a description. For when I say that the rules are arbitrary, 
I mean that they are not determined by reality in the way the 
description of reality is. And that means: it is nonsense to say that 
they agree with reality, e.g. that the rules for the words “blue” and 
“red” agree with the facts about those colours etc. 


What the equation p.q=p really shows is the connection 
between entailment and the truth-functions. 


1. Cf. Tractatus 5, 132 (Ed.). 


246

“If p follows from q, then thinking that q must involve thinking that p.”” 


Remember that a general proposition might entail a logical sum 
of a hundred or so terms, which we certainly didn’t think of when 
we uttered the general proposition. Yet can’t we say that it follows 
from it? 


“What follows from a thought must be involved in thinking it. 
For there is nothing in a thought that we aren’t aware of while we 
are thinking it. It isn’t a machine which might be explored with 
unexpected results, a machine which might achieve something 
that couldn’t be read off from it. That is, the way it works is /ogical, 
it’s quite different from the way a machine works. Qua thought, it 
contains nothing more than was put into it. As a machine function- 
ing causally, it might be believed capable of anything; but in logic 
we get out of it only what we meant by it.” 

If I say that the square is entirely white, I don’t think of ten 
smaller rectangles contained in it which are white, and I can’t 
think of “a//” rectangles or patches contained in it. Similarly in 
the proposition “he is in the room” I don’t think of a hundred 
possible positions he might be in and certainly not of a// possible 
positions. 


“Wherever you hit the target you’ve won. You’ve hit it in the 
upper right hand section, so...” 


At first sight there seem to be two kinds of deduction: in one of 
them the premise mentions everything the conclusion does and in 
the other not. An instance of the first kind is the inference from 
p-q to q; an instance of the second is the inference; the whole 
stick is white, so the middle third of it is white too. This conclusion 
mentions boundaries that are not mentioned in the first proposition. 
(That is dubious.) Again, if I say ‘If you hit the target anywhere in 
this circle you will win the prize...” and then “You have hit it 
here, so...” the place mentioned in the second proposition was 
not prescribed in the first. The target after the shot stands in a 
certain internal relation to the target as I saw it before, and that 

247 


relation consists in the shot’s falling within the bounds of the 
general possibility that we foresaw. But the shot was not in itself 
foreseen and did not occur, or at least need not have occurred, in 
the first picture. For even supposing that at the time I thought of a 
thousand definite possibilities, it was at least possible for the one 
that was later realised to have been omitted. And if the foreseeing of 
that possibility really had been essential, the overlooking of this 
single case would have given the premise the wrong sense and the 
conclusion wouldn’t any longer follow from it. 

On the other hand you don’t add anything to the proposition 
“Wherever you hit this circle ...”” by saying “Wherever you hit 
this circle, and in particular if you hit the black dot...” If the 
black dot was already there when the first proposition was uttered, 
then of course it was meant too; and if it wasn’t there, then the 
actual sense of the proposition has been altered by it. 


But what is it supposed to mean to say “If one proposition 
follows from another, thinking the second must involve thinking 
the first”, since in the proposition “I am 170 cm tall” it isn’t 
necessary to think of even a single one of the negative statements 
of height that follow from it? 


“The cross is situated thus on the straight line: |——X¥_|”"- 

“So it is between the strokes”’. 

“It is 165° here” — “So it is certainly more than 15°” 

Incidentally, if you are surprised that one proposition can follow 
from another even though one doesn’t think of the former while 
thinking of the latter, you should consider that p v q follows from 
p, and I certainly don’t think all propositions of the form p v & 
while I am thinking p. 


The whole idea that a proposition has to be thought along with 
any proposition that entails it rests on a false, psychologising 
notion. We must concern ourselves only with what is contained in 
the signs and the rules. 


248 


If the criterion for p’s following from q consists in “thinking of 
p being involved in thinking of q’” then while thinking of the 
proposition “‘in this box there are 10° grains of sand’’, you are 
thinking also of the 10° sentences “In this box there is one grain 
of sand” “‘... 2 grains of sand”’, etc. etc. What’s the criterion here 
for the thought of one proposition’s being involved in the thought 
of another ? 

And what about a proposition like “There is a patch(F) between 
the limits AA”?

Doesn’t it follow from that that F is also between BB and CC and 
so on? Don’t infinitely many propositions follow from a single 
one ? Does that make it infinitely significant ? - From the proposi- 
tion “There is a patch between the limits AA”’ there follow as many 
propositions of the type “there is a patch between the limits BB” 
as I write out — and no more than I write out. Similarly, from p 
there follow as many propositions of the form p v & as I write out 
(or utter etc.). 

(A ptoof by induction proves as many propositions of the 
form... as I write out.)

The case of infinitely many propositions following from a single one 


Is it impossible that infinitely many propositions should follow 
from a single one —in the sense, that is, that we might go on 
ad infinitum constructing new propositions from a single one 
according to a rule? 


Suppose that we wrote the first thousand propositions of the 
series in conjunction. Wouldn’t the sense of this product necessarily 
approximate more closely to the sense of our first proposition than 
the product of the first hundred propositions ? Wouldn’t we obtain 
an ever closer approximation to the first proposition the further 
we extended the product ? And wouldn’t that show that it can’t be 
the case that from one proposition infinitely many others follow, 
since I can’t understand even the product with 10!° terms and yet I 
understood the proposition to which the product with 10!°° terms 
is a closer approximation than the one with 10!° terms ? 


We imagine, perhaps, that the general proposition is an abbrevia- 
ted expression of the product. But what is there in the product to 
abbreviate? It doesn’t contain anything superfluous. 


If we need an example of infinitely many propositions following 
from a single one, perhaps the simplest is the way in which “a is 
red” entails the negation of all propositions that ascribe a different 
colour to a. The negative propositions are certainly not contained 
in the thought of the single positive one. Of course we might say 
that we don’t distinguish infinitely many shades of colour; but the 
question is whether the number of shades of colour we distinguish 
has anything at all to do with the complexity of the first sentence: 
is it more or less complex the more or fewer colours we distinguish ? 

Wouldn’t this be what we’d have to say: it’s only when a 
proposition exists that it follows from it. It’s only when we have 
constructed ten propositions following from the first one that ten 
propositions do follow from it. 


I want to say that one proposition doesn’t follow from another 
until it is confronted with it. The “etc ad infinitum” indicates only 
the possiblity of constructing propositions following from the 
first; it doesn’t yield a definite number of such propositions. 

So mightn’t I simply say: it is because it is impossible to write out 
infinitely many propositions (i.e. to say that is a piece of nonsense) 
that infinitely many propositions don’t follow from a single 


proposition. 


What about the proposition “the surface is white from A to 
B”’? It does follow from it that the surface is white from A’ to B’. 
It needn’t be a seen patch of white that is in question; and certainly 
the inference from the first proposition to the second is often 
drawn. Someone says to me “I have painted the patch white from 
A to B” and then I say “so it’s certainly painted white from A’ to 
eae 

It must be possible to say a priori that F(A’ B’) wow/d follow from 
F(AB). 


If the lines A’ and B’ exist, then the second proposition certainly 
does follow from the first (in that case the compositeness is 
already there in the first proposition); but in that case it is only as 
many propositions as correspond to its compositeness that follow 
from the first proposition (and so never infinitely many). 


“The whole is white, therefore a part bounded by such and such 
a line is white.” “The whole was white, so that part of it also was 


white even if I didn’t then perceive it bounded within it.” 


“A surface seen as undivided has no parts.” 
But let’s imagine a ruler laid against the surface, so that the 


251 


appearance we are presented with is first [[ __] and then 
CT J and then (-T-T TJ. It doesn’t at all follow from 
the first strip’s being entirely white that in the second and the third 
everything except the graduating lines is white. 


“If you hit the target anywhere within the circle, you have won.” 

“T think you will hit the target somewhere within the circle.” 

Someone might ask about the first proposition: how do you 
know ? Have you tried a// possible places ? And the answer would 
have to be: that isn’t a proposition at all, it is a general stipulation. 


The inference doesn’t go like this: “If the shot hits the target 
anywhere, you have won. You have hit the target there, so you have 
won”. For where is this here? Is it marked out in any way other 
than by the shot ~ say by a circle? And was that already there on 
the target beforehand ? If not, then the target has changed; if so, it 
must have been foreseen as a possible place to hit. We should 
rather say: “You have hit the target, so...” 


The place on the target does not necessarily have to be given by 
a mark on the target, like a citcle. For there are always descriptions 
like “nearer the centre’’, “nearer the edge’, “‘on the right side at 
the top’’, etc. Wherever the target is hit such descriptions must 
always be possible. (But there are not “infinitely many”? such 


descriptions.) 


Does it make sense to say: “But if you hit the target, you must 
hit it somewhere’ or ““Wherever he hits the surface it won’t be a 
surprise, we won’t have to say ‘I didn’t expect that. I didn’t know 
there was such a place’ >?’ What that means is that it can’t be a 
geometrical surprise. 


What sort of proposition is: “On this strip you may see all 
shades of grey between black and white” ? Here it looks at first 
glance as if we’re talking about infinitely many shades. 

Indeed, we are apparently confronted here by the paradox that 
we can, of course, only distinguish a finite number of shades, and 
naturally the distinction between them isn’t infinitely slight, and 
yet we see a continuous transition. 


tr 


t2 


It is just as impossible to conceive of a particular grey as being 
one of the infinitely many greys between black and white as it is to 
conceive of a tangent t as being one of the infinitely many transi- 
tional stages in going from t, to t,. If I see a ruler roll around the 
circle from t, to t, I see — if its motion is continuous — none of the 
intermediate positions in the sense in which I see t when the 
tangent is at rest; or else I see only a finite number of such positions. 
But if in sucha case I appear to infer a particular case froma general 
proposition, then the general proposition is never derived from 
experience, and the proposition isn’t a real proposition. 

If, e.g., I say “I saw the ruler move from t, to t, therefore I must 
have seen it at t” this doen’t give us a valid logical inference. That 
is, if what I mean is that the ruler must have appeared to me at t and 
so, if I’m talking about the position in visual space, then it doesn’t 


253 


in the least follow from the premise. But if I’m talking about the 
physical ruler, then of course it’s possible for the ruler to have 
skipped over position t and yet for the phenomenon in visual 
space to have remained continuous. 


254

Can an experience show that one proposition follows from another? 


The only essential point is that we cannot say that it was through 
experience we were made aware of an extra application of grammar. 
For in making that statement we would have to describe the 
application, and even if this is the first time I have realised that the 
description is true I must have been able to understand it even 
before the experience. 


It is the old question : how far can one now speak of an experience 
that one is not now having? 

What I cannot foresee I can not foresee. 

And what I can now speak of, I can now speak of independently 
of what I can’t now speak of. 

Logic just is always complex. 


“How can I know everything that’s going to follow?’ What 
I can know then, I can also know now. 


But are there general rules of grammar, or only rules for general 
signs ? 

What kind of thing in chess (or some other game) would count as 
a general rule or a particular rule? Every rule is general. 

Still, there is one kind of generality in the rule that p v q follows 
from p and a different kind in the rule that every proposition of the 
form p,~~p,~~~~p... follows from p.q. But isn’t the 
generality of the rule for the knight’s move different from the 
generality of the rule for the beginning of a game? 


Is the word “rule” altogether ambiguous? So should we talk 
only about particular cases of rules, and stop talking about rules 
in general, and indeed about languages in general ? 


“Tf F(a) [= ahas the colour F,] entails ~F (a) then the possibility 
of the second proposition must have been provided for in the 


grammar of the first (otherwise how could we call F, and F, 
colours ?) 

“If the second proposition as it were turned up without being 
expected by the first it couldn’t possibly follow from it.” 

“The first proposition must acknowledge the second as its 
consequence. Or rather they must be united in a single grammar 
which remains the same before and after the inference.” 

(Here it is very difficult not to tell fairy tales about symbolic 
ptocesses, just as elsewhere it is hard not to tell fairy tales about 
psychological processes. But everything is simple and familiar 
(there is nothing new to be discovered). That is the terrible thing 
about logic, that its extraordinary difficulty lies in the fact that 
nothing must be constructed, and everything is already present 
familiar.) 


“No proposition is a consequence of p unless p acknowledges it 
as its consequence.” 


Whether a proposition entails another proposition must be 
clear from the grammar of the proposition and from that alone. It 
cannot be the result of any insight into a new sense: only of an 
insight into the old sense. It is not possible to construct a new 
proposition that follows from the old one which could not have 
been constructed (perhaps without knowing whether it was true 
ot false) when the old one was constructed. If a new sense were 
discovered and followed from the first proposition, wouldn’t that 
mean that that proposition had altered its sense ? 


256 


Il GENERALITY 


The proposition “The circle is in the square” is in a certain sense inde- 
pendent of the assignment of a particular position. (In a certain sense it 
is totally unconnected.) 


I would like to say: a general picture like | o | does not have the 
same metric as a particular one. 


In the general sign “‘|o|”’ the distances play no greater part than 
they do in the sign “aRb”. 


The drawing | 0 | can be looked on as a representation of the 
“general case”. It is as if it were not in a measurable space: the 
distances between the citcle and the lines are of no consequence. 
The picture, taken thus, is not seen as occurring in the same 
system as when one sees it as the representation of a particular 
position of the circle between the lines. Or rather, taken thus, it is 
a part of a different calculus. The rules that govern variables are 
not the same as those that govern their particular values. 


“How do you know he is in the room?” “Because I put him in 
and there is no way he can get out.” Then your knowledge of the 
general fact that he is somewhere in the room has the same multi- 
plicity as that reason. 


Let us take the particular case of the general state of affairs of 
the cross being between the end-lines. 


HL» # —*4] K —_44 FH 


Each of these cases, for instance, has its own individuality. Is 
there any way in which this individuality enters into the sense of 
the general sentence ? Obviously not. 


‘Being between the lines, or the walls’ seems something simple 
and the particular positions (both the visual appearances and the 


257 


positions established by measurement) seem quite independent 
of it. 

That is, when we talk about the individual (seen) positions we 
appear to be talking about something quite different from the 
topic of the general proposition. 


There is one calculus containing our general characterization 
and another containing the disjunction. If we say that the cross 
is between the lines we don’t have any disjunction ready to take the 
place of the general proposition. 


If we consider a general proposition like “the circle is in the 
square” it appears time and again that the assignment of a position 
in the square is not (at least so far as visual space is concerned) a 
more precise specification of the statement that the circle is iz the 
Square any more than a statement of the colour of a material is a 
more precise specification of a statement of its hardness. — Rather, 
“in the square” appears a complete specification which in itself 
does not admit of any more precise description. Now of course the 
statements about the circle are not related to each other like the 
statements about colour and hardness, and yet that feeling is not 
baseless. 


The grammatical rules for the terms of the general proposition 
must contain the multiplicity of possible particular cases provided 
for by the proposition. What isn’t contained in the rules isn’t 
provided for. 


All these patterns might be the same state of affairs distorted. 
(Imagine the two white strips and the middle black strip as elastic.) 


Does fa’s following from (x).fx mean that a is mentioned in 


258 


(x).fx? Yes, if the general proposition is meant in such a way that 
its verification consists in an enumeration. 


If I say “‘there is a black circle in the square”, it always seems to 
me that here again I have something simple in mind, and don’t 
have to think of different possible positions or sizes of the circle. 
And yet one may say: if there is a circle in the square, it must be 
somewhere and have some size. But in any case there cannot be any 
question of my thinking in advance of a// the possible positions 
and sizes. —It is rather that in the first proposition I seem to put 
them through a kind of sieve so that “circle in a square” corres- 
ponds to a single impression, which doesn’t take any account of 
the where etc., as if it were (against all appearance) something only 
physically, and not logically, connected with the first state of 
affairs. 

The point of the expression “‘sieve” is this. If I look at a land- 
scape or something similar through a glass which transmits only 
the distinction between brightness and darkness and not the 
distinctions between colouts, such a glass can be called a sieve; and 
if one thinks of the square as being looked at through a glass 
which transmits only the distinction “circle in the square or not in 
the square” and no distinction between positions or sizes of the 
circle, here too we might speak of a sieve. 


I would like to say that in the proposition “‘there is a circle in the 
square” the particular positions are not mentioned at all. In the 
picture I don’t see the position, I disregard it, as if the distances 
from the sides of the square were elastic and their lengthsof no 
account. 

Indeed, can’t the patch actually be moving in the square ? Isn’t 
that just a special case of being in the square? So in that case it 
wouldn’t be true that the patch has to be in a particular position 
in the square if it is there at all. 


I want to say that the patch seems to have a relation to the edge 
that is independent of its distance. - Almost as if I were using a 


259 


geometry in which there is no such thing as distance, but only 
inside and outside. Looked at in this way, there is no doubt that 


the two pictures [ ° | and x are the same. 


By itself the proposition “The patch is in the square” does no 
more than hold the patch in the square, as it were; it is only in this 
way that it limits the patch’s freedom; within the square it allows 
it complete freedom. The proposition constructs a frame that 
limits the freedom of the patch but within the frame it leaves it 
free, that is, it has nothing to do with its position. For that to be so 
the proposition must have the logical nature of the frame (like a 
box enclosing the patch). And so it has, because I could explain the 
Proposition to someone and set out the possibilities, quite inde- 


pendently of whether such a proposition is true or not, indepen- 
dently of a fact. 


“Wherever the patch is in the square...” means “as long as it 
is in the square...” and here all that is meant is the freedom 
(lack of restraint) in the square, not a set of positions. 


Of course between this freedom and the totality of possibilities, 
there is a logical similarity (formal analogy), and that is why the 
same words are often used in the two cases (“all’”, “every’’, etc.). 


“No degrees of brightness below this one hurt my eyes.” Test 
the type of generality. 


“All points on this surface are white.” How do you verify that? 
— then I will know what it means. 


260 


6 


The proposition “The circle is in the square’ is not a disjunction of cases. 


If I say the patch is in the square, I know —and must know — 
that it may have various possible positions. I know too that I 
couldn’t give a definite number of all such positions. I do not 
know in advance how many positions “J could distinguish .- 
And trying it out won’t tell me what I want to know here either. 

The darkness veiling the possible positions etc. is the current 
logical situation, just as dim lighting is a particular sort of lighting. 


Here it always seems as if we can’t quite get an overall view of 
a logical form because we don’t know how many or what possible 
positions there are for the patch in the square. But on the other 
hand we do know, because we aren’t surprised by any of them 
when they turn up. 


Of course “position of the circle in this square” isn’t a CeOCer 
which particular positions fall under as objects. You couldn’t 
discover objects and ascertain that they were positions of the 
circle in the square which you didn’t know about beforehand. 


Incidentally, the centre and other special positions in the 
circle are quite analogous to the primary colours on the colour 
scale. (This comparison might be pursued with profit.) 


Space is as it were a single possibility; it doesn’t consist of several 
possibilities. 


So if I hear that the book is somewhere on the table, and then 
find it in a particular position, it isn’t possible for me to be ane 
prised and say “oh, I didn’t know that there was this position” : 
and yet I hadn’t foreseen this particular position i.e. envisaged it in 


261 


oe _ 


advance as a particular possibility. It is physical, not logical 
possibilities that take me by surprise! 


But what is the difference between “the book is somewhere on 
the table” and “‘the event will occur sometime in the future >” 
Obviously the difference is that in the one case we have a sure 
method of verifying whether the book is on the table, while in the 
other case there is no such method. If a particular event were 
supposed to occur at one of the infinitely many bisections of a 
line, or better, if it were supposed to occur when we cut the line 
at a single point, not further specified, and then waited a minute at 


that point, that statement would be as senseless as the one about 
the infinite future. 


Suppose I stated a disjunction of so many positions that it was 
impossible for me to see a single position as distinct from all those 
given; would /hat disjunction be the general proposition (4x). fx? 
Wouldn’t it be a kind of pedantry to continue to refuse to recog- 
nize the disjunction as the general proposition? Or is there an 
essential distinction, and is the disjunction totally unlike the 
general proposition ? 


What so strikes us is that the one proposition is so complicated 


and the other so simple. Or is the simple one only an abbreviation 
for the more complicated one? 


What then is the criterion for the general ptoposition, for the 
circle’s being in the square ? Either, nothing that has anything to do 
with a set of positions (or sizes) or something that deals with a 
finite number of such positions. 


If one says that the patch A is somewhere between the limits B 
and C, isn’t it obviously possible to describe or portray a number 
of positions of A between B and C in such a way that I see the 
succession of all the positions as a continuous transition? And in 


262 


he 


that case isn’t the disjunction of all those N positions the very 


proposition that A is somewhere between B and C? 

But what are these N pictures really like ? Itis clear that a picture 
must not be visually discernible from its immediate successor, or 
the transition will be discontinuous. 

The positions whose succession I see aS a continuous tran- 
sition ate positions which are not in visual space. 


How is the extension of the concept “lying between” deter- 
mined? Because it has to be laid down in advance what possi- 
bilities belong to this concept. As I say, it cannot be a surprise that 
I call #hat too “lying between”. Or: how can the rules for the 
expression “lie between” be given when I can’t enumerate the 
cases of lying between ? Of course that itself must be a character- 
istic of the meaning of the expression. 


Indeed if we wanted to explain the word to someone we wouldn’t 
try to do so by indicating a// particular instances, but by showing him 
one ot two such instances and intimating in some way that it 
wasn’t a question of the particular case. 


It is not only that the enumeration of positions is unnecessary: 
in the nature of things there can be no question of such an enumera- 
tion here. 


Saying “The circle is either between the two lines or here” 
(where “here” is a place between the lines) obviously means no 
more than “The circle is between the two lines’, and the rider 
“or here” is superfluous. You will say: the “here” is alteasy. 
included in the “somewhere’’. But that is strange, since it isnt 


mentioned in it. 


There is a particular difficulty when the signs don’t appear to 
say what the thought grasps, or the words don’t say what the 
thought appears to grasp. 


263 


As when we say “this theorem holds of all numbers” and think 


that in our thought we have comprehended all numbers like apples 
in a box. 


But now it might be asked: how can I know in advance which 


propositions entail this general proposition, if I can’t specify the 
propositions ? 


But can one say “We can’t say which propositions entail this 
proposition”? That sounds like: we don’t know. But of course 
that isn’t how itis. I can indeed say, and say in advance, propositions 
that entail it. “Only not a// of them.” But that just has no meaning. 


There is just the general proposition and particular propositions 
(not se particular propositions). But the general proposition does 
not enumerate particular propositions. In that case what charac- 
terizes it as general, and what shows that it doesn’t simply com- 


prise the particular propositions we are speaking of in this par- 
ticular case ? 


It cannot be characterized by its instantiations, because however 
many we enumerate, it could still be mistaken for the product of 
the cited cases. Its generality, therefore, lies in a property (a 
grammatical property) of the variables. 


264 


J 
The inadequacy of the Frege-Russell notation for generality 


The real difficulty lies in the concept of “(dn)” and in general 
of “(4x)”. The original source of this notation is the expression of 
our word-language:“‘There isa. . . with such and such properties”. 
And here what replaces the dots is something like “book from my 
library” or “thing (body) in this room”, “word in this letter”’, etc. 
We think of objects that we can go through one after the other. As 
so often happens a process of sublimation turned this form into 
“there is an object such that...” and here too people imagined 
originally the objects of the world as like ‘objects’ in the room (the 
tables, chairs, books, etc.), although it is clear that in many cases 
the grammar of this “(4x), etc.” is not at all the same as the grammar 
of the primitive case which serves as a paradigm. The discrepancy 
between the original picture and the one to which the notation is 
now applied becomes particularly palpable when a proposition 
like “there are two circles in this square” is rendered as “‘there is 
no object that has the property of being a circle in this square 
without being the circle a or the circle b” or “there are not three 
objects that have the property of being a circle in this square’. 
The proposition “there are only two things that are circles in this 
square” (construed on the model of the proposition “there are 
only two men who have climbed this mountain”’) sounds crazy, 
with good reason. That is to say, nothing is gained by forcing the 
proposition “there are two circles in this square” into that form; 
it only helps to conceal that we haven’t cleared up the grammar of 
the proposition. But at the same time the Russellian notation here 
gives an appearance of exactitude which makes people believe 
the problems are solved by putting the proposition into the 
Russellian form. (This is no less dangerous than using the word 
“probably” without further investigation into the use of the word 
in this particular case. For understandable reasons the word 


265 


“probably”, too, is connected with an idea of exactitude.) 

“One of the four legs of this table doesn’t hold” {‘There are 
Englishmen with black hair’, “There is a speck on this wall” 
“The two pots have the same weight’, ““There are the same 
number of words on each of the two pages’’. In all these cases in 
the Russellian notation the “(4...)...”’ is used, and each time with a 
different grammar. The point I want to make is that nothing much 
is gained by translating such a sentence from word-language into 
Russellian notation. 


It makes sense to say “write down any cardinal number”’ but 
not “write down all cardinal numbers’’. ““There is a circle in the 
square” [(4x).fx)] makes sense, but not ~dx.~ fx: “‘all circles 
ate in the square.” “There is a red circle on a background of a 
different colour’”’ makes sense, but not “‘there isn’t a background- 
colour other than red that doesn’t have a red circle on it.” 

“In this square there is a black circle’’. If this proposition has the 
form “(4x).x is a black circle in a square” what sort of thing is it 
that has the property of being a black circle (and so can also have 
the property of not being a black circle) ? Is it a place in the square ? 
But then there is no proposition “(x).x isa black...” On the other 
hand the proposition could mean “There is a speck in the square 
that is a black circle”. How is that proposition verified ? Well, we 
take the different specks in the square in turn and investigate 
whether they are quite black and circular. But what kind of 
proposition is ‘“There isn’t a speck in the square’’? For if in the 
former case the ‘x’ in ‘(4x)’ meant ‘speck in the square’, then 
though “(4x).fx’ is a possible proposition both ‘(4x)’ and 
“(dx)” are not. Or again, I might ask: what sort of thing is it 
that has (or does not have) the property of being a speck in the 
square ? 

And if we can say ‘““There is a speck in the square”’ does it then 
also make sense to say “‘All specks are in the square”? All which? 


266 


Ordinary language says “In this square there is a red circle’; 
the Russellian notation says ““There is an object which is a red 
circle in this square”. That form of expression is obviously 
modelled on ‘“‘There is a substance which shines in the dark” 
“There is a circle in this square which is red’’. —- Perhaps even the 
expression “there is” is misleading. “There is” really means the 
same as “Among these circles there is one...” or“... there exists 


> 


one... . 
So if we go as far as we can in the direction of the Russellian 


mode of expression and say “In this square there is a place where 
there is a red circle”, that really means, among these places there 
is one where . . . etc. 


(In logic the most difficult standpoint is that of sound common 
sense. For in order to justify its view it demands the whole truth; 
it will not help by the slightest concession or construction.) 


The correct expression of this sort of generality is therefore the 
expression of ordinary language “There is a circle in the square”’, 
which simply leaves the position of the circle open (leaves it un- 
decided). (““Undecided” is a correct expression, since there just 
has not been any decision.) 


8 
Criticism of my former view of generality 


My view about general propositions was that (4x). ox is a logical 
sum and that though its terms aren’t enumerated here, they are 
capable of being enumerated (from the dictionary and the grammar 
of language). 

For if they can’t be enumerated we don’t have a logical sum. 
(A rule, perhaps, for the construction of logical sums). 


Of course, the explanation of (4x). x as a logical sum and of 
(x). ox asa logical product is indefensible. It went with an incorrect 
notion of logical analysis in that I thought that some day the 
logical product for a particular (x) .ex would be found. — Of course 
it is correct that (4x). x behaves in some ways like a logical sum 
and (x).ox like a product; indeed for one use of words “all” and 
“some” my old explanation is correct, — for instance for “all the 
primary colours occur in this picture” or “all the notes of the C 
major scale occur in this theme”’. But for cases like “‘all men die 
before they are 200 years old” my explanation is not correct. The 
way in which (4x). x behaves like a logical sum is expressed by its 
following from ga and from ¢a vigb, i.e. in the rules 


(4x).9x: 9a. = .oa and 
(ax).ox:ga v pb. =.¢a v gb 
From these rules Russell’s fundamental laws follow as tautolo- 
gies: 
ox. > .(dz).92z 
x V oy. 2 .(4z).oz 
For (4x). x we need also the rules: 
(Ax). ox v bx. = .(4x). px. v.(Ax). px 
(Ax,y) ox. by.v.(4x). ox.x. = .(4x). px :(4x). px. 


Every such rule is an expression of the analogy between (4x). 9x 
and a logical sum. 


268 


Incidentally, we really could introduce a notation for (4x).@x in 
which it was replaced by a sign “or v 9s v gt .. .” which could then 
be used in calculation like a logical sum; but we would have to 
provide rules for reconverting this notation at any time into the 
“(4x).¢x’’ notation and thus distinguishing the sign “ga v gb 
v gc...” from the sign for a logical sum. The point of this nota- 
tion could simply be to enable us to calculate more easily with 
(Ax) .ox in certain cases. 


If am right, there is no concept “pure colour”; the proposition 
A’s colour is a pure colour” simply means “A is red, or yellow, 
ot blue, or green”. “This hat belongs either to A or B or C” is not 
the same proposition as “This hat belongs to a person in this room” 
even when in fact only A, B and C are in the room, for that itself 
is something that has to be added. - “On this surface there are 
two pute colours” means: on this surface there is red and yellow, 
or red and green, or .. . etc. 

If this means I can’t say “there are 4 pure colours”’, still the 
pure colours and the number 4 are somehow connected with each 
other and that must express itself in some way. — For instance, I 
may say “‘on this surface I see 4 colours: yellow, blue, red, green”. 


The generality notation of our ordinary language grasps the 
logical form even more superficially than I earlier believed. In 
this respect it is comparable with the subject-predicate form. 

Generality is as ambiguous as the subject-predicate form. 


There are as many different “alls” as there are different “ones”. 


So it is no use using the word “all” for clarification unless we 
know its grammar in this particular case. 


9 
The explanation of generality by examples 


Let us think how we explain the concept plant. We show some- 
one several objects and say they are plants; then he points to 
another object and asks “‘is that a plant too?” and we reply “yes, 
that too” etc. I would once have said that he has now seen in 
what he has been shown the concept ‘plant’ — the common ele- 
ment — and that he does not see the examples used in the explana- 
tion in the same way when he sees the concept in them as when he 
views them just as representatives of a particular shape and colour 
or the like. (Just as I also used to say that when he understands 
variables as variables he sees something in them which he doesn’t 
see in the sign for the particular case). But the notion of “seeing in” 
is taken from the case in which I see a figure like |||| differently 
“phrased”. In that case, I really do see different figures, but in a 
different sense; and what these have in common, apart from their 
similarity, is their being caused by the same physical pattern. 

But this explanation cannot be applied without further ado to 
the case of the understanding of a variable or of the examples 
illustrating the concept “plant”. For suppose we really had seen 
something in them that we don’t see in plants that are shown only 
for their own sake, the question remains whether this, or any other, 
picture can entitle us to apply them as variables. I might have 
shown someone the plants by way of explanation and given him 
in addition a drug causing him to see the examples in the special 
way. (Just as it would be possible that a drunken man might 
always see a group like |||| as ||| |). And this would give the ex- 
planation of the concept in an unambiguous manner, and the 
specimens exhibited and the accompanying gestures would 
communicate to anyone who understood just ¢his picture. But 
that is not the way it is. ~ It may well be true that someone who 
sees a sign like |||||| as a numeral for 6 sees it differently (sees 
something different in it) from someone who views it only as a 


270 


sign for “‘some”’, since he fixes his attention on something different; 
but what matters is the system of rules governing the signs, and 
it isn’t seeing the signs in a particular manner that is the essence of 
understanding. 


It would be possible to say “now I don’t see it as a rose, but as a 
plant”. 

Or “now I see it only as a rose, and no longer as ¢his rose’’. 

“I see the patch merely in the square and no longer in a specific 
position.” 


The mental process of understanding is of no interest to us 
(any more than the mental process of an intuition). 


“Still, there’s no doubt that someone who understands the 
examples as arbitrary cases chosen to illustrate the concept doesn’t 
understand the same as a man who regards them as a definitely 
bounded enumeration.” Quite right, but what does the first man 
understand that the second doesn’t ? Well, in the things he is shown 
he sees only examples to illustrate certain features; he doesn’t 
think that I am showing him the things for their own sake as well. - 


I would like to call the one class “logically bounded” and the 
other “logically unbounded”. 


Yes, but is it really true that he sees only these features in the 
things? In a leaf, say, does he see only what is common to all 
leaves ? That would be as if he saw everything else blank like an 
uncompleted form with the essential features ready printed. (But 
the function “‘f(. . .)”’ is just such a form.) 


But what sort of a process is it when someone shows me several 
different things as examples of a concept to get me to see what is 
common to them, and when I look for it and then actually see it? 
He may draw my attention to what is common. - But by doing this

ie 


does he make me see the object differently ? Perhaps so; for surely 
I may take a special look at one of the parts, when otherwise I 
would have seen the whole with equal clarity. But this seeing is 
not the understanding of the concept. For what we see isn’t 
something with an empty argument place. 


One might also ask: Does a man who regards the sign “|||...” 
as a sign for the concept of number (in contrast with “|||’’ to denote 
3) see the first group of lines differently from the second ? Even if 
he does see it differently (perhaps, as it were, more blurred) does he 
see there anything like the essence of the concept of number? 
Wouldn’t that mean that he would actually have to be unable to 
distinguish “|||...” and “||||...’? from each other? (As indeed 
he would, if I had given him some drug that made him see the 
concept.) 


For if I say: by givingus a few examples he makes us see the 
common element in them and disregard the rest, that really means 
that the rest falls into the background, as it were becomes paler 
(or altogether disappears — why not ?) and “‘the common element”, 
say the oval shape, remains alone in the foreground. 

But that isn’t the way it is. Apart from anything else, the multi- 
plicity of examples would be no more than a mechanical device, 
and once I had seen what I was supposed to, I could see it in a 
single example too. (As indeed ‘(4x).fx’ itself contains only one 
example.) 


So it is the rules governing the example that make it an example. 


But by now at any rate, if someone says to me something like 
“make an egg shape” the bare concept word without any illustra- 
tion suffices to make itself understood (and the past history of this 
understanding is of no interest to us): and I do not want to say 
that when I understand the command (and the word “‘egg’’) I see 


272 


init Bs nee 


the concept of an egg before my mind’s eye. 

When I make an application of the concept “egg” or “plant”’ 
there certainly isn’t some general picture in front of my mind 
before I do so, and when I hear the word “plant” it isn’t that 
there comes before my mind a picture of a certain object which 
I then describe as a plant. No, I make the application as it were 
spontaneously. Still, in the case of certain applications I might 


> 99 


say “No, I didn’t mean that by ‘plant’ ”’, or, “Yes, I meant that 
too”. But does that mean that these pictures came before my 
mind and that mentally I expressly rejected and admitted them ? — 
And yet that is what it looks like, when I say: “Yes, I meant 
all those things, but not ¢hat.”” But one might then ask: “But 
did you foresee all those cases?’’ and then the answer might 
be “yes” or “no, but I imagined there must be something 
between this form and that one” or the like. But commonly 
at that moment I did not draw any bounds, and they can only 
be produced in a roundabout way after reflection. For instance, 
I say “Bring me a flower about so big”; he brings one and I 
say: Yes, that is the size I meant. Perhaps I do remember a 
picture which came before my mind, but it isn’t that that makes the 
flower that has been brought acceptable. What I am doing is 
making an application of the picture, and the application was not 
anticipated. 


The only thing of interest to us is the exact relationship between 
the example and the behaviour that accords with it. 


The example is the point of departure for further calculation. 
Examples are decent signs, not rubbish or hocus-pocus. 


The only thing that interests us is the geometry of the mechanism. 
(That means, the grammar of its description.) 


But how does it come out in our rules, that the instances of fx 


273 


we are dealing with are not essentially closed classes ? — Only in- 
deed in the generality of the general rule. - How does it come out 
that they don’t have the same significance for the calculus as a 
closed group of primitive signs (like the names of the 6 basic 
colours) ? How else could it come out except in the rules given for 
them? — Suppose that in some game I am allowed to help myself 
to as many pieces as I like of a certain kind, while only a limited 
number of another kind is available; or suppose a game is un- 
bounded in time but spatially bounded, or something similar. 
The case is exactly the same. The distinction between the two 
different types of piece in the game must be laid down in the 
tules; they will say about the one type that you can take as many 
pieces as you want of that kind. And I mustn’t look for another 
mote testrictive expression of that rule. 


That means that the expression for the unboundedness of the 
particular instances in question will be a general expression; there 
cannot be some other expression in which the other unconsidered 
instances appear in some shadowy way. 


It is clear that I do not recognize any logical sum as a definition 
of the proposition “the cross is between the lines”. And that says 
everything that is to be said. 


There is one thing I always want to say to clarify the distinc- 
tion between instances that are offered as examples for a concept 
and instances that make up a definite closed group in the grammar. 
Suppose, after explaining “‘a, b, c, d are books”, someone says 
“Now bring me a book”’. If the person brings a book which isn’t 
one of the ones shown him he can still be said to have acted correctly 
in accordance with the rule given. But if what had been said was 
“a, b, c, d, are my books. — Bring me one of my books”’, it would 
have been incorrect to bring a different one and he would have 
been told “I told you that a, b, c, d are my books”. In the first case 
it isn’t against the rule to bring an object other than those named, 


274 


in the second case it is. But if in the order you named only a, b, c, and 
d, and yet you regarded the behaviour f(e) as obeying the order, 
doesn’t that mean that by F(a, b, c, d, . . .) you meant F(a, b, c, d, e) 
after all ? Again, how are these orders distinct from each other if the 
same thing obeys both of them ? — But f(g) too would have been in 
accordance with the order and not only f(e). Right, then your first 
order must have meant F(a, b, c,d, e, g) etc. Whatever you bring me 
is something I could have included in a disjunction. So if we con- 
struct the disjunction of all the cases we actually use, how would it 
differ syntactically from the general proposition ? For we can’t say: 
by the fact that the general proposition is also made true by r (which 
doesn’t occur in the disjunction), because that doesn’t distinguish 
the general proposition from a disjunction which contains rf. 
(And every other similar answer too is impossible.) But it will make 
sense to say: F(a, b, c, d, e) is the disjunction of all the cases we have 
actually used, but there are also other cases (we won’t of course, 
mention any) that make true the general proposition “F(a, b, c, d, 
...)”. And here of course we can’t put the general proposition in 
place of F(a, b, c, d, ¢,). 


It is, by the way, a very important fact that the parenthesis in the 
previous paragraph “and every other similar answer too is im- 
possible” is senseless, because though you can give as instances 
of a generalization different particular cases, you can’t give 
different variables because the variables r,s,t don’t differ in their 
meaning. 


Of course one couldn’t say that when we do f(d) we don’t obey 
f(3) in the same way as we obey a disjunction containing f(d), 
because f(3) = f(3) v £(d). If you give someone the order “bring 
me some plant or other, or this one” (giving him a picture of it), he 
will simply discard the picture and say to himself “since any one 
will do, the picture doesn’t matter”. By contrast, we won’t simply 


275 


\ 
i 
i 


discard the picture if we are given it plus five others and the order 
to bring one of these six plants. (So what matters is which disjunc- 
tion contains the particular command.) And you wouldn’t be 
guided in the same way by the order “f(a) v f(b) v f(c)”’ as by the 
order “‘f(J)” (= £(3) v f(c)), even if in each case you do f(c). - The 
picture f(c) sinks into f(J). (It is no good sitting in a boat, if you and 
it are under water and sinking). Someone may be inclined to say: 
“Suppose you do f(c) on the command f(3); in that case f(c) might 
have been expressly permitted and then how would the general 
command have differed from a disjunction?” — But if the per- 
mission had occurred in a disjunction with the general sentence, 
you couldn’t have appealed to it. 

So is this how it is: “bring me a flower” can never be replaced 
by an order of the form “bring mea or b or c”, but must always be 
“bring mea or b or c or some other flower”? 

But why does the general sentence behave so indeterminately 
when every case which actually occurs is something I could have 
described in advance ? 


But even that seems to me not to get to the heart of the matter; 
because what matters, I believe, isn’t really the infinity of the 
possibilities, but a kind of indeterminacy. Indeed, if I were asked 
how many possibilities a circle in the visual field has of being 
within a particular square, I could neither name a finite number, nor 
say that there were infinitely many (as in a Euclidean plane). 
Here, although we don’t ever come to an end, the series isn’t 
endless in the way in which | 1, &, € +1 | is. 

Rather, no end to which we come is really the end; that is, I 
could always say: I don’t understand why these should be all the 
possibilities. - And doesn’t that just mean that it is senseless to 
speak of “all the possibilities” ? So enumeration doesn’t touch the 
concepts “plant” and “egg”’ at all. 


276 


$ 


And although we say that we could always have forseen f(a) as a 
possible particular execution of the order, still we didn’t in fact 
ever do so. — But even if I do foresee the possibility f(a) and 
expressly include it in my order, it gets lost beside the general 
proposition, because I can see from the general proposition 
itself that this particular case is permitted; it isn’t just from its 
being expressly permitted in the order that I see this. If the general 
proposition is there, the addition of the particular case isn’t any 
extra use to me (that is, it doesn’t make the command more ex- 
plicit). Indeed it was only the general proposition that gave me 
the justification for placing this particular case beside it. What 
my whole argument is aiming at, is that someone might believe 
that the addition of the particular case supersedes the — as it were 
blurred - generality of the proposition, that you could say “we 
don’t need it any more, now we have the particular case.”’ Yes, 
but say I admit that the reason I put in the particular case is that 
it agrees with the general proposition! Or suppose I admit that I 
recognize that f(a) is a particular case of f(4)! For I can’t say: that 
just means that f(3) is a disjunction with f(a) as one of its terms; for 
if that is so, the disjunction must be capable of being stated, and 
£(4) must be defined as a disjunction. There would be no difficulty 
in giving such a definition, but it wouldn’t correspond to the use of 
£(4) that we have in mind. It isn’t that the disjunction always leaves 
something over; it is that it just doesn’t touch the essential thing 
in generality, and even if it is added to it it depends on the general 
proposition for its justification. 


First I command f(4); he obeys the order and does f(a). Then I 
think that I could just as well have given him the command 
“£(3) v f(a)”. (For I knew in advance that f(a) obeyed the order 
£(4) and to command him £(4) v f(a) would come to the same.) 
In that case when he obeyed the order he would have been acting 
on the disjunction ‘‘do something or f(a)’. And if he obeys the order 


277 


by doing f(a) isn’t it immaterial what else is disjoined with f(a) ? 
If he does f(a) in any case, the order is obeyed whatever the alter- 
native is. 

I would also like to say: in grammar nothing is supplementary, 
no stipulations come affer others, everything is there simul- 
taneously. 

Thus I can’t even say that I first gave the command f(J) and only 
later realised that f(a) was a case of £(J); at all events my order was 
and remained f(4) and I added f(a) to it in the knowledge that 
f(a) was in accordance with f(3). And the stipulation that f(a) is in 
accordance with f(J) presupposes the sense that belongs to the 
proposition f(J) if it is taken as an independent unit and not defined 
as replaceable by a disjunction. And my proposition “at all events 
my order was and remained f(A) etc.”” only means that I didn’t 
replace the general order by a disjunction. 

Suppose I give the order p v f(a), and the addressee doesn’t 
clearly understand the first part of the order but does understand 
that the order goes “...v f(a)”. He might then do f(a) and say 
“I know for certain that I’ve obeyed the command, even though I 
didn’t understand the first part”’. And that too is how I imagine it 
when I say that the other alternative doesn’t matter. But in that 
case he didn’t obey the order shat was given, but simply treated it as 
“f(a)!’? One might ask: if someone does f(a) at the command 
“f(3) v f(a)” is he obeying the order because (i.e. in so far as) the 
order is of the form & v f(a), or because f(3) v f(a) = f(A)? If you 
understand f(4) and therefore know that f(A) v f(a) = (4), then by 
doing f(a) you are obeying f(3)even if I write it “f(3) v f(a)’ because 
you can see none the less that f(a) is a case of f(4). And now someone 
might object: if you see that Fa is a case of F(3) that just means that 
f(a) is contained disjunctively in £(4), and therefore that f(3) is 
defined by means of f(a). The remaining parts of the disjunction — 
he will have to say — don’t concern me because the terms I see are 
the only ones I now need. — By explaining ‘that f(a) is an instance of 
f(4)’ ‘you have said no more than that f(a) occurs in f(4) alongside 

certain other terms.’ — But that is precisely what we don’t mean. 
It isn’t as if our stipulation was an incomplete definition of f(A); 


278 


for that would mean that a complete definition was possible. 
That would be the disjunction which would make the addition 
“y £(4)” as it were ridiculous, since it would only be the enumerated 
instances which concerned us. But according to our idea of f(3), 
the stipulation that f(a) is a case of f(A) is not an incomplete defi- 
nition of £(4); it is not a definition of £(4) at all. That means that I 
don’t approximate to the sense of f(4) by multiplying the number 
of cases in the disjunction; though the disjunction of the cases 
v f(A) is equivalent to f(A), it is never equivalent to the disjunction 
of the cases alone; it is a totally different proposition. 


What is said about an enumeration of individual cases cannot 
ever be a roundabout explanation of generality. 


But can I give the rules of entailment that hold in this case? 
How do I know that (4x). fx does follow from fa? After all I can’t 
give a// the propositions from which it follows. —- But that isn’t 
necessary; if (4x). fx follows from fa, shat at any rate was something 
that could be known in advance of any particular experience, and 
stated in the grammar. 


I said “in advance of any experience it was possible to know and 
to state in the grammar that (4x).fx follows from fa’’, But it 
should have been: ‘(4x).fx follows from fa’ is not a proposition 
(empirical proposition) of the language to which ‘(4x).fx’ and 
‘fa’ belong; it is a rule laid down in their grammar.

The law of a series 
“And so on” 


We can of course set up a tule for the use of the variables, and 
the fact that in order to do so we need the same kind of variable 
does not make it pleonastic. For if we didn’t use it, then the 
variable would be defined by the rules, and we don’t assume that it 
can be defined, or that it must be defined (for sooner or later defi- 
nitions come to an end). 


This means only that ~ e.g. — the variable ‘‘x?” is not an ab- 
breviation (say for a logical sum), and that in our thought too 
there is only a sign for this multiplicity. 


For suppose I had enumerated 7 particular instances and said 
“but their logical sum isn’t the general proposition” that still 
wouldn’t be enough; and I want to say further that no other 
number of instances yields the general proposition either. But 
in this rider once again I seem to go through an enumeration, in a 
kind of shadowy manner if not in actuality. But that is not the way 
it is, because the words that occur in the rider are quite different 
from the numerals. 


“But how can I forbid a particular numeral to be inserted in 
such and such a place ? I surely can’t foresee what number someone 
will want to insert, so that I can forbid it”. You can forbid it 
when it comes. — But here we are already speaking of the general 
concept of number! 


But what makes a sign an expression of infinity ? What gives the 
peculiar character that belongs to what we call infinite? I believe 
that it is like the case of a sign for an enormous number. For the 
characteristic of the infinite, conceived in this way, is its enormous 
size. 


But there isn’t anything that is an enumeration and yet not an 
enumeration; a generality that enumerates in a cloudy kind of 


280 


way without really enumerating or enumerating to a determined 
limit. 


The dots in “1-+1+1+1...” are just the four dots: a sign, 
for which it must be possible to give certain rules. (The same rules, 
in fact, as for the sign “and so on ad inf.”.) This sign does in a 
manner ape enumeration, but it isn’t an enumeration. And that 
means that the rules governing it don’t totally agree with those 
which govern an enumeration; they agree only up to a point. 


There is no third thing between the particular enumeration and 
the general sign. 


Of course the natural numbers have only been written down up 
to a certain highest point, let’s say 10!°. Now what constitutes the 
possibility of writing down numbers that have not yet been written 
down ? How odd is this feeling that they are all somewhere already 
in existence! (Frege said that before it was drawn a construction 
line was in a certain sense already there.) 


The difficulty here is to fight off the thought that possibility is a 
kind of shadowy reality. 


In the rules for the variable aa variable b may occur and so may 
particular numerals; but not any totality of numbers. 


But now it seems as if this involved denying the existence of 
something in logic: perhaps generality itself, or what the dots 
indicate; whatever is incomplete (loose, capable of further exten- 
sion) in the number series. And of course we may not and cannot 
deny the existence of anything. So how does this indeterminacy find 
expression ? Roughly thus: if we introduce numbers substitutible 
for the variable a, we don’t say of any of them that it is the last, or the 
highest. 


281 


But suppose someone asked us after the explanation of a form 
of calculation “‘and is 103 the last sign I can use?” What are we to 
answer? “No, it isn’t the last” or “there isn’t a last 2” Mustn’t 
Lask him in turn “If it isn’t the last, what would come next?” 
And if he then says “104” I should say “Quite right, you can 
continue the series yourself”. 


Of an end to the possibility, I cannot speak at all. 


(In philosophy the one thing we must guard against is waffle. 
A tule that can be applied in practice is always in order.) 


It is clear that we can follow a rule like ja, &, + 1|. 1 mean by 
really following the rule for constructing it without previously 
being able to write down the series. In that case it’s the same as if 
I were to begin a series with a number like 1 and then say “now 
add 7, multiply by 5, take the square root of the result, and always 
apply this complex operation once again to the result”. (That 


would be the rule |1, &, V(& + 7)-5]-) 


The expression “and so on” is nothing but the expression “and 
so on” (nothing, that is, but a sign in a calculus which can’t do 
more than have meaning via the rules that hold of it; which can’t 


say more than it shows). 
That is, the expression “and so on” does not harbour a secret 


power by which the series is continued without being continued. 


Of course it doesn’t contain shat, you'll say, but still it contains 
the meaning of infinite continuation. 


But we might ask: how does it happen that someone who now 


applies the general rule to a further number is still following this 
rule? How does it happen that no further rule was necessary 


282 


to allow him to apply the general rule to this case in spite of the 
fact that this case was not mentioned in the general rule ? 


And so we are puzzled that we can’t bridge over this abyss 
between the individual numbers and the general proposition. 


“Can one imagine an empty space?” (Surprisingly, this is where 
this question belongs.) 


It is one of the most deep rooted mistakes of philosophy to see 
possibility as a shadow of reality. 

But on the other hand it can’t be an error; not even if one calls 
the proposition such a shadow. 


Here again, of course, there is a danger of falling into a positivism 
of a kind which deserves a special name, and hence of course rast 
be an error. For we must avoid accepting party lines or particular 
views of things; we must not disown anything that anyone has 
ever said on the topic, except where he himself had a particular 
view or theory. 


For the sign “and so on”, ot some sign corresponding to it, is 
essential if we are to indicate endlessness — through the rules, of 
course, that govern such a sign. That is to say, we can distinguish 
the limited series “1, 1+ 1, 1 + 1+ 17 from the series “1, 1+ 1 
1+1-+1and soon”, And this last sign and its use is no less essen- 
tial for the calculus than any other. 


What troubles me is that the “and so on” apparently has to 
occur also in the rules for the sign ‘“‘and so on”. For instance, 1 
> > 

I+1andsoon.=.1,1+1,1+1+1andsoon, and so on. 


But then isn’t this simply the old point that we can describe 


language only from the outside? So that we can’t expect by des- 
cribing language to penetrate to depths deeper than language 


283 


i 
1 
| 


itself reveals: for it is by means of language that we describe 
language. 


We might say: there’s no occasion to be afraid of our using the 
expression “and so on” in a way that transcends the finite. 


Moreover, the distinctive part of the grammar of “and so on” 
can’t consist in rules connecting “and so on” with particular 
numerals (not “the particular numerals’’) — for these rules in turn 
mention some bit of a series — but in rules connecting “and so on” 
with ‘“‘and so on”’. 


The possibility of introducing further numbers. The difficulty 
seems to be that the numbers I’ve in fact introduced aren’t a group 
that is essential and yet there is nothing to indicate that they are 
an arbitrary collection: Out of all numbers just those numbers that 
happen to have been written down. 

(Asif I had all the pieces of a game in a box anda chance selection 
from the box on the table beside it. 

Or, as if one lot of numerals was traced in ink, while all of them 
ate as it were drawn faintly in advance.) 

But apart from the ones we happen to have used we have only 
the general form. 

Isn’t it here, by the way, — odd as it may sound — that the distinc- 
tion between numerals and numbers comes ? 


Suppose, for example, I say “By ‘cardinal number’ I mean 
whatever results from 1 by continued addition of 1”. The word 
“continued” doesn’t represent a nebulous continuation of 1,1 +1, 
1+1-+1; on the contrary the sign “1, 1+1,1+1+1.. . is to 
be taken as perfectly exact; governed by definite rules which are 
different from those for “1, 1 +1, 1+1+ 17, and not a substitute 
for a series “which cannot be written down”’. 


284 


In other words: we calculate with the sign “1,1 +1,1+141 
...” just as with the numerals, but in accordance with different 
rules. 


But what is it then that we imagine? What is the mistake we 
make ? What kind of thing do we take the sign “1,1 +1...” tobe? 
That is: where does what we think we see in this sign rea//y occur? 
Something like when I say “the counted 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on up to 
1000”, where it would also be possible really to write down all the 
numbers. 


What do we see “1, 1+31,1+1+1....” as? 

As an inexact form of expression. The dots are like extra 
numerals indistinctly visible. It is as if we stopped writing 
numerals, because after all we can’t write them all down, but as if 
they are there all right in a kind of box. Again, it is something 
like when I sing only the first notes of a melody distinctly, and then 
merely hint at the rest and let it taper off into nothing. (Or when in 
writing one writes only a few letters of a word distinctly and ends 
with an unarticulated line.) In all such cases the ‘indistinctly has a 
‘distinctly’ corresponding to it. 


I once said that there couldn’t be both numbers aad and the 
concept of number. And that is quite correct, if it means that a 
variable doesn’t have the same relation to a number as the concept 
apple has to an apple (or the concept sword to Nothung). 

On the other hand, a number-variable is not a numeral. 


But I also wanted to say that the concept of number couldn’t 
be given independently of the numbers, and that isn’t true. A 
number-variable is independent of particular numbers in the sense 
that there does exist a calculus with a class of our numerals and 
without the general number-variable. In that calculus, of course, 
not all the rules which hold of our numerals will be valid, but those 
numerals will correspond to ours in the way that the draughtsmen 
in draughts correspond to those in losing draughts. 


What I am opposing is the view that the infinite number series is 


285 


something given concerning which there are both particular 
number theorems and also general theorems about all numbers of 
the series; so that the arithmetical calculus wouldn’t be complete 
if it didn’t contain the general theorems about cardinal numbers, 
ie. general equations of the form a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c. 
Whereas even 1/3 =0°3 belongs to a different calculus from 
1/3 =0-3. And similarly a general sign-rule (e.g. a recursive 
definition) that holds for 1,(1) + 1,() +1) +1,((a) +1) +1) +1, 
and so on is something different from a particular definition. The 
general rule adds to the number calculus something extra, without 
which it would have been no less complete than the arithmetic 
of the number series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 


The question also arises: where is the concept of number (or of 
cardinal number) indispensable? Number, in contrast to what? 
l/1, & &+1 |, perhaps, in contrast to | 5, EVE | etc. —For if I 
really do introduce such a sign (like | 1, &, +1 |) and don’t just 
take it along as a luxury, then I must do something with it, ie. 
use itin a calculus, and then it loses its solitary splendour and occurs 
in a system of signs coordinated with it. 


You will perhaps say: but surely “cardinal number” is contrasted 
with “rational number’’, “real number’’, etc. But this distinction 
is a distinction between the rules (the rules of the appropriate 
game) — not a distinction between positions on the chessboard — 
not a distinction demanding different coordinated words in the 


same calculus. 


We say “this theorem is proved for all cardinal numbers”. But 
let us just see how the concept of cardinal numbers enters into the 
proof. Only because 1 and the operation £ + 1 are spoken of in the 
proof — not in contrast to anything the rational numbers have. So 
if we use the concept-word “cardinal number” to describe the 
ptoof in prose, we see — don’t we? — that no concept corresponds 
to that word. 


286 


The expressions “the cardinal numbers’’, “the real numbers’, 
are extraordinarily misleading except where they are used to help 
specify particular numbers, as in “the cardinal numbers from 1 to 
100’, etc. There is no such thing as “the cardinal numbers’’, but 
only “cardinal numbers” and the concept, the form “cardinal 
number”. Now we say “the number of the cardinal numbers is 
smaller than the number of the real numbers” and we imagine 
that we could perhaps write the two series side by side (if only we 
weren’t weak humans) and then the one series would end in endless- 
ness, whereas the other would go on beyond it into the actual 
infinite. But this is all nonsense. If we can talk of a relationship 
which can be called by analogy “greater” and “smaller”, it can only 
be a relationship between the forms “‘cardinal number” and “real 
number”’. I learn what a series is by having it explained to me and 
only to the extent that it is explained to me. A finite series is 
explained to me by examples of the type 1, 2, 3, 4, and infinite one 
by signs of the type “1, 2, 3, 4, and so on” or “1, 2, 3,4...” 


It is important that I can understand (see) the rule of projection 
without having it in front of me in a general notation. I can detect 
a general rule in the series }, 2, 3, 4g — of course I can detect any 
number of others too, but still I can detect a particular one, and that 
means that this series was somehow for me the expression of that 
one rule. 


If you have “intuitively” understood the law of a series, e.g. 
the series m, so that you are able to construct an arbitrary term 
m(n), then you’ve completely understood the law, just as well as 
anything like an algebraic formulation could convey it. That is, no 
such formulation can now make you understand it better, and 
therefore to that extent no such formulation is any more rigorous, 
although it may of course be easier to take in. 


We are inclined to believe that the notation that gives a series 


by writing down a few terms plus the sign “‘and so on’’is essentially 
inexact, by contrast with the specification of the general term. 


287 


Here we forget that the general term is specified by reference to a 
basic series which cannot in turn be described by a general term. 
Thus 2n+1 is the general term of the odd numbers, 7/n ranges 
over the cardinal numbers, but it would be nonsense to say that n 
was the general term of the series of cardinal numbers. If you want 
to define that series, you can’t do it by specifying “the general 
term n’’, but of course only by a definition like “1,1 +1,1+1+41 
and so on”. And of course there is no essential difference between 
that series and “1,1 -+1+1,1+1+1+1+1 nd so on”, which 
I could just as well have taken as the basic series (so that then the 
general term of the cardinal number series would have been 


4(n—1).) 


(3x). ox: ~ (x, y)- 9x. 9y 
(Ax, y). px. py: ~ (AX, y, Zz). eX. GY. oz 
(3x, y, Zz). x. py.9z: ~ (AX, y, Zz, U). xX. PY. Oz. pu 


“How would we now go about writing the general form of such 
propositions? The question manifestly has a good sense. For if 
I write down only a few such propositions as examples, you under- 
stand what the essential element in these propositions is meant to 
be.” 

Well, in that case the row of examples is already a notation: for 
understanding the series consists in our applying the symbol, and 
distinguishing it from others in the same system, e.g. from 


(Ax). ox 
(Ax, y, Z). PX. PY. MZ. 
(Ax, y, Z, U, V). PX. PY. Zz. QU. OV 
But why shouldn’t we write the general term of the first series 
thus: 


(4x1, ... x,).T1%* px:(4x, ... Xn41)- 1,2" px?! 


Is this notation inexact? It isn’t supposed by itself to make 
anything graphic; all that matters are the rules for its use, the 
system in which it is used. The scruples attaching to it date from a 
train of thought which was concerned with the number of primi- 
tive signs in the calculus of Principia Mathematica. 


1. Perhaps Wittgenstein inadvertently omitted a negation sign before the 
second quantifier. (Trs.)

Ill FOUNDATIONS OF MATHEMATICS 


Il 
The comparison between mathematics and a game 


What are we taking away from mathematics when we say it is 
only a game (or: it is a game) ? 


A game, in contrast to what?- What are we awarding to 
mathematics if we say it isn’t a game, its propositions have a sense ? 


The sense outside the proposition. 

What concern is it of ours? Where does it manifest itself and 
what can we do with it? (To the question “what is the sense of this 
proposition ?”’ the answer is a proposition.) 

(“But a mathematical proposition does express a thought.” — 


What thought ? -.) 


Can it be expressed by another proposition? Or only by ¢his 
proposition ? — Or not at all? In that case it is no concern of ours. 


Do you simply want to distinguish mathematical propositions 
from other constructions, such as hypotheses ? You are right to do 
so: there is no doubt that there is a distinction. 


If you want to say that mathematics is played like chess or 
patience, and the point of it is like winning or coming out, that 
is manifestly incorrect. 


If you say that the mental processes accompanying the use of 
mathematical symbols are different from those accompanying 
chess, I wouldn’t know what to say about that. 


In chess there are some positions that are impossible although 


each individual piece is in a permissible position. (E.g. if all the 
pawns are still in their initial position, but a bishop is already in 


289 


play.) But one could imagine a game in which a record was kept of 
the number of moves from the beginning of the game and then 
there would be certain positions which could not occur after n 
moves and yet one could not read off from a position by itself 
whether or not it was a possible nth position. 


What we do in games must correspond to what we do in calculat- 
ing. (I mean: it’s there that the correspondence must be, or again, 
that’s the way that the two must be correlated with each other.) 


Is mathematics about signs on paper? No more than chess is 
about wooden pieces. 

When we talk about the sense of mathematical propositions, or 
what they are about, we are using a false picture. Here too, I mean, 
it looks as if there are inessential, arbitrary signs which have an 
essential element in common, namely the sense. 


Since mathematics is a calculus and hence isn’t really about 
anything, there isn’t any metamathematics. 


What is the relation between a chess problem and a game of 
chess ? ~ It is clear that chess problems correspond to arithmetical 
problems, indeed that they are arithmetical problems. 


The following would be an example of an arithmetical game: We 
write down a four-figure number at random, e.g. 7368; we are to 
get as near to this number as possible by multiplying the numbers 
7; 3, 6, 8 with each other in any order. The players calculate with 
pencil and paper, and the person who comes nearest to the number 
7368 in the smallest number of steps wins. (Many mathematical 
puzzles, incidentally, can be turned into games of this kind.) 


Suppose a human being had been taught arithmetic only for use 
in an arithmetical game: would he have learnt something different 
from a person who learns arithmetic for its ordinary use? If he 
multiplies 21 by 8 in the game and gets 168, does he do something 


290 


different from a person who wanted to find out how many 21 x 8 


is? 


It will be said: the one wanted to find out a truth, but the other 
did not want to do anything of the sort. 


Well, we might want to compare this with a game like tennis. In 
tennis the player makes a particular movement which causes the 
ball to travel in a particular way, and we can view his hitting the 
ball either as an experiment, leading to the discovery of a particular 
truth, or else as a stroke with the sole purpose of winning the game. 

But this comparison wouldn’t fit, because we don’t regard a 
move in chess as an experiment (though that too we might do); we 
regard it as a step in a calculation. 


Someone might perhaps say: In the arithmetical game we do 
indeed do the multiplication 21 x 8, 
168 
but the equation 21 x 8= 168 doesn’t occur in the game. But 
isn’t that a superficial distinction ? And why shouldn’t we multiply 
(and of course divide) in such a way that the equations were written 
down as equations ? 


So one can only object that in the game the equation is not a 
proposition. But what does that mean? How does it become a 
proposition ? What must be added to it to make it a proposition ? 
—Isn’t it a matter of the use of the equation (or of the multiplica- 
tion) ? — And it is certainly a piece of mathematics when it is used in 
the transition from one proposition to another. And thus the 
specific difference between mathematics and a game gets linked up 
with the concept of proposition (not ‘mathematical proposition’) 
and thereby loses its actuality for us. 


But one could say that the real distinction lay in the fact that in 
the game there is no room for affirmation and negation. For 


291 


instance, there is multiplication and 21 x 8 = 148 would be a false 
move, but “( 21x 8= 148)’, which is a correct arithmetical 
proposition, would have no business in our game. 


(Here we may remind ourselves that in elementary schools they 
never work with inequations. The children are only asked to carry 
out multiplications correctly and never — or hardly ever — asked to 
prove an inequation.) 


When I work out 21 x 8 in our game the steps in the calculation, 
at least, are the same as when I do it in order to solve a practical 
problem (and we could make room in a game for inequations 
also). But my attitude to the sum in other respects differs in the 
two cases. 

Now the question is: can we say of someone playing the game 
who reaches the position “z1 x 8 = 168” that he has found out 
that 21 x 8 is 168? What does he lack? I think the only thing 
missing is an application for the sum. 


Calling arithmetic a game is no more and no less wrong than 
calling moving chessmen according to chess-rules a game; for that 
might be a calculation too. 


So we should say: No, the word “arithmetic” is not the name 
of a game. (That too of course is trivial) - But the meaning of the 
word “arithmetic” can be clarified by bringing out the relationship 
between arithmetic and an arithmetical game, or between a chess 
problem and the game of chess. 

But in doing so it is essential to recognize that the relationship is 
not the same as that between a tennis problem and the game of 
tennis. 

By “tennis problem” I mean something like the problem of 
returning a ball in a particular direction in given circumstances. 
(A billiard problem would perhaps be a clearer case.) A billiard 
ptoblem isn’t 2 mathematical problem (although its solution may 
be an application of mathematics). A billiard problem is a physical 


292 


problem and therefore a “problem” in the sense of physics; a chess 
problem is a mathematical problem and so a “problem” in a 
different sense, a mathematical sense. 


In the debate between “formalism” and “‘contentful mathe- 
matics” what does each side assert ? This dispute is so like the one 
between realism and idealism in that it will soon have become 
obsolete, for example, and in that both parties make unjust asser- 
tions at variance with their day-to-day practice. 


Arithmetic isn’t a game, it wouldn’t occur to anyone to include 
arithmetic in a list of games played by human beings. 


What constitutes winning and losing in a game (or success in 
patience) ? It isn’t of course, just the winning position. A special 
rule is needed to lay down who is the winner. (““Draughts” and 
“losing draughts”’ differ only in this rule.) 


Now is the rule which says ‘“The one who first has his pieces in 
the other one’s half is the winner” a statement ? How would it be 
verified ? How do I know if someone has won? Because he is 
pleased, or something of the kind? Really what the rule says is: 
you must try to get your pieces as soon as possible, etc. 

In this form the rule connects the game with life. And we could 
imagine that in an elementary school in which one of the subjects 
taught was chess the teacher would react to a pupil’s bad moves in 
exactly the same way as to a sum worked out wrongly. 


I would almost like to say: It is true that in the game there isn’t 
any “true” and “false” but then in arithmetic there isn’t any 
“winning” and “losing”. 


293 


I once said that is was imaginable that wars might be fought on 
a kind of huge chessboard according to the rules of chess. But if 
everything really went simply according to the rules of chess, then 
you wouldn’t need a battlefield for the war, it could be played on 
an ordinary board; and then it wouldn’t be a war in the ordinary 
sense. But you really could imagine a battle conducted in accordance 
with the rules of chess — if, say, the “bishop” could fight with the 
“queen”? only when his position in relation to her was such that he 
would be allowed to “‘take”’ her in chess. 


Could we imagine a game of chess being played (i.e. a complete 
set of chess moves being carried out) in such different surroundings 
that what happened wasn’t something we could call the playing of 
a game? 

Certainly, it might be a case of the two participants collaborating 
to solve a problem. (And we could easily construct a case on these 
lines in which such a task would have a utility). 


The rule about winning and losing really just makes a distinction 
between two poles. It is not concerned with what later happens to 
the winner (or loser) — whether, for instance, the loser has to pay 
anything. 

(And similarly, the thought occurs, with “right” and “wrong” 
in sums.) 


In logic the same thing keeps happening as happened in the 
dispute about the nature of definition. If someone says that a 
definition is concerned only with signs and does no more than 
substitute one sign for another, people resist and say that that isn’t 
alla definition does, or that there are different kinds of definition 
and the interesting and important ones aren’t the mere “verbal 
definitions”’. 

They think, that is, that if you make definition out to be a mere 
substitution rule for signs you take away its significance and 
importance. But the significance of a definition lies in its application, 
in its importance for life. The same thing is happening today in the 


294 


dispute between formalism and intuitionism, etc. People cannot 
separate the importance, the consequences, the application of a 
fact from the fact itself; they can’t separate the description of a 
thing from the description of its importance. 


We are always being told that a mathematician works by instinct 
(or that he doesn’t proceed mechanically like a chessplayer or the 
like), but we aren’t told what that’s supposed to have to do with the 
nature of mathematics. If such a psychological phenomenon does 
play a part in mathematics we need to know how far we can speak 
about mathematics with complete exactitude, and how far we can 
only speak with the indeterminacy we must use in speaking of 
instincts etc. 


Time and again I would like to say: What I check is the account 
books of mathematicians; their mental processes, joys, depressions 
and instincts as they go about their business may be important in 
other connections, but they are no concern of mine. 


295 


12 
There is no metamathematics. 


No calculus can decide a philosophical problem. 
A calculus cannot give us information about the foundations of 
mathematics. 


So there can’t be any “leading problems” of mathematical logic, 
if those are supposed to be problems whose solution would at long 
last give us the right to do arithmetic as we do. 


We can’t wait for the lucky chance of the solution of a mathe- 
matical problem. 


I said earlier “calculus is not a mathematical concept”’; in other 
words, the word “calculus” is not a chesspiece that belongs to 
mathematics. 

There is no need for it to occur in mathematics. — If it is used ina 
calculus nonetheless, that doesn’t make the calculus into a 
metacalculus; in such a case the word is just a chessman like all the 
others. 


Logic isn’t metamathematics either; that is, work within the 
logical calculus can’t bring to light essential truths about mathema- 
tics. Cf. here the “decision problem” and similar topics in modern 
mathematical logic. 


(Through Russell and Whitehead, especially Whitehead, there 
entered philosophy a false exactitude that is the worst enemy of real 
exactitude. At the bottom of this there lies the erroneous opinion 
that a calculus could be the mathematical foundation of mathe- 
matics.) 


Number is not at all a “fundamental mathematical concept””!. 


1. According to Dr. C. Lewy Wittgenstein wrote in the margin of F. P. 
Ramsey’s copy of the Tractatus at 6.02: “Number is he fundamental idea of 
calculus and must be introduced as such.” This was, Lewy thinks, in the year 
1923. See Mind, July 1967, p. 422. 


296 


There are so many calculations in which numbers aren’t mentioned. 

So far as concerns arithmetic, what we are willing to call numbers 
is more or less arbitrary. For the rest, what we have to do is to 
describe the calculus — say of cardinal numbers — that is, we must 
give its rules and by doing so we lay the foundations of arithmetic. 


Teach it to us, and then you have laid its foundations. 


(Hilbert sets up rules of a particular calculus as rules of meta- 
mathematics.) 


A system’s being based on first principles is not the same as its 
being developed from them. It makes a difference whether it is 
like a house resting on its lowest walls or like a celestial body 
floating free in space which we have begun to build beneath 
although we might have built anywhere else. 


Logic and mathematics are not based on axioms, any more than 
a group is based on the elements and operations that define it. The 
idea that they are involves the error of treating the intuitiveness, the 
self-evidence, of the fundamental propositions as a criterion for 
correctness in logic. 

A foundation that stands on nothing is a bad foundation. 


(p.q) V(p. ~ gq) V(~p.q) V(~ p. ~ q.): That is my tautology, 
and then I go on to say that every “proposition of logic” can be 
brought into this form in accordance with specified rules. But that 
means the same as: can be derived from it. This would take us as 
far as the Russellian method of demonstration and all we add to it 


297 


is that this initial form is not itself an independent proposition, and 
that like all other “laws of logic” it has the property that p. Log = 
p, p v Log = Log. 


It is indeed the essence of a “logical law” that when it is conjoined 
with any proposition it yields that proposition. We might even 
begin Russell’s calculus with definitions like 


p2p:q.=.q 
p:pvq. =.p, ete.

Proofs of Relevance 


If we prove that a problem can be solved, the concept “solution” 
must occur somewhere in the proof. (There must be something in 
the mechanism corresponding to the concept.) But the concept 
cannot have an external description as its proxy; it must be 
genuinely spelt out. 


The only proof of the provability of a proposition is a proof of 
the proposition itself. But there is something we might call a 
proof of relevance: an example would be a proof convincing me 
that I can verify the equation 17 x 38 = 456 before I have actually 
done so. Well, how is it that I know that I can check 17 x 38 = 456, 
whereas I perhaps wouldn’t know, merely by looking, whether I 
could check an expression in the integral calculus ? Obviously, it is 
because I know that the equation is constructed in accordance with 
a definite rule and because I know the kind of connection between 
the rule for the solution of the sum and the way in which the 
proposition is put together. In that case a proof of relevance would 
be something like a formulation of the general method of doing 
things like multiplication sums, enabling us to recognize the 
general form of the propositions it makes it possible to check. In 
that case I can say I recognise that this method will verify the 
equation without having actually carried out the verification. 


When we speak of proofs of relevance (and other similar 
mathematical entities) it always looks as if in addition to the par- 
ticular series of operations called proofs of relevance, we had a 
quite definite inclusive concept of such proofs or of mathematical 
proof in general; but in fact the word is applied with many different, 
more or less related, meanings. (Like words such as “people”, 
“king”, “religion”, etc.; cf Spengler.) Just think of the role of 
examples in the explanation of such words. If I want to explain 
what I mean by “proof”, I will have to point to examples of proofs, 


just as when explaining the word “apple” I point to apples. The 
definition of the word “proof”? is in the same case as the definition 
of the word “number”. I can define the expression “cardinal 
number” by pointing to examples of cardinal numbers; indeed in- 
stead of the expression I can actually use the sign “1, 2,3,4,andsoon 
ad inf”’. I can define the word ‘“‘number”’ too by pointing to various 
kinds of number; but when I do so I am not circumscribing the 
concept “number” as definitely as I previously circumscribed 
the concept cardinal number, unless I want to say that it is only 
the things at present called numbers that constitute the concept 
“number”, in which case we can’t say of any new construction that 
it constructs a kind of number. But the way we want to use the word 
“proof” in is one in which it isn’t simply defined by a disjunction 
of proofs currently in use; we want to use it in cases of which 
at present we “can’t have any idea”’. To the extent that the concept 
of proof is sharply circumscribed, it is only through particular 
proofs, or through series of proofs (like the number series), and 
we must keep that in mind if we want to speak absolutely precisely 
about proofs of relevance, of consistency etc. 


We can say: A proof of relevance a/fers the calculus containing 
the proposition to which it refers. It cannot justify a calculus 
containing the proposition, in the sense in which carrying out the 
multiplication 17 x 23 justifies the writing down of the equation 
17 X 23 =391. Not, that is, unless we expressly give the word 
“Sustify” that meaning. But in that case we mustn’t believe that if 
mathematics lacks this justification, it is in some more general and 
widely established sense illegitimate or suspicious. (That would be 
like someone wanting to say: “the use of the expression ‘pile of 
stones’ is fundamentally illegitimate, until we have laid down 
officially how many stones make a pile.” Such a stipulation would 
modify the use of the word “pile” but it wouldn’t “justify” it in 
any generally recognized sense; and if such an official definition 
were given, it wouldn’t mean that the use earlier made of the word 
would be stigmatized as incorrect.) 


300 


we 


The proof of the verifiability of 17 x 23 = 391 is not a “proof” 
in the same sense of the word as the proof of the equation 
itself. (A cobbler heels, a doctor heals: both ...) We grasp the 
verifiability of the equation from its proof somewhat as we grasp 
the verifiability of the proposition “the points A and B are not 
separated by a turn of the spiral’’ from the figure. And we see that 
the proposition stating verifiability isn’t a “proposition” in the 
same sense as the one whose verifiability is asserted. Here again, one 
can only say: look at the proof, and you will see what is proved 
here, what gets called “the proposition proved”. 


Can one say that at each step of a proof we need a new insight ? 
(The individuality of numbers.) Something of the following sort: 
if I am given a general (variable) rule, I must recognize each time 
afresh that this rule may be applied 4ere too (that it holds for shis 
case too). No act of foresight can absolve me from this act of 
insight. Since the form in which the rule is applied is in fact a new 
one at every step. But it is not a matter of an act of insight, but of an 
act of decision. 


What I called a proof of relevance does not climb the ladder to 


its proposition — since that requires that you pass every rung - 
but only shows that the ladder leads in the direction of that propo-

sition. (There are no surrogates in logic). Neither is an arrow that 
points the direction a surrogate for going through all the stages 
towards a particular goal.

Consistency proofs 


Something tells me that a contradiction in the axioms of a 
system can’t really do any harm until it is revealed. We think of a 
hidden contradiction as like a hidden illness which does harm even 
though (and perhaps precisely because) it doesn’t show itself in an 
obvious way. But two rules in a game which in a particular instance 
contradict each other are perfectly in order until the case turns up, 
and it’s only then that it becomes necessary to make a decision 
between them by a further rule. 


Mathematicians nowadays make so much fuss about proofs of 
the consistency of axioms. I have the feeling that if there were a 
contradiction in the axioms of a system it wouldn’t be such a great 
misfortune. Nothing easier than to remove it. 


“We may not use a system of axioms before its consistency has 
been proved.” 

“In the rules of the game no contradictions may occur.” 

Why not? “Because then one wouldn’t know how to play.” - 

But how does it happen that our reaction to a contradiction is a 
doubt ? 

We don’t have any reaction to a contradiction. We can only say: 
if it’s really meant like that (if the contradiction is supposed to be 
there) I don’t understand it. Or: it isn’t something I’ve learnt. I 
don’t understand the sign. J haven’t learnt what I am to do with it, 
whether it is a command, etc. 


Suppose someone wanted to add to the usual axioms of arith- 
metic the equation 2 x 2 = 5. Of course that would mean that the 
sign of equality had changed its meaning, i.e. that there would now 
be different rules for the equals-sign. 


303 


If I inferred “T cannot use it as a substitution sign” that would 
mean that its grammar no longer fitted the grammar of the word 
“substitute’’ (“substitution sign’’, etc.). For the word “can” in 
that proposition doesn’t indicate a physical (physiological, 
psychological) possibility. 


“The rules many not contradict each other” is like “negation, 
when doubled, may not yield a negation’’. That is, it is part of the 
66,0995 


grammar of the word “‘rule” that if “‘p” is a rule, “p. ~ p” is nota 
tule. 


That means we could also say: the rules may contradict each 
other, if the rules for the use of the word “rule”’ are different — if 
the word “rule” has a different meaning. 


Here too we cannot give any foundation (except a biological or 
historical one or something of the kind); all we can do is to 
establish the agreement, or disagreement between the rules for 
certain words, and say that these words are used with these rules. 


It cannot be shown, proved, that these rules can be used as the 
rules of this activity. 

Except by showing that the grammar of the description of the 
activity fits the rules. 


“In the rules there mustn’t be a contradiction” looks like an 
instruction: “In a clock the hand mustn’t be loose on the shaft.” 
We expect a reason: because otherwise . . . But in the first case the 
reason would have to be: because otherwise it wouldn’t be a set 
of rules. Once again we have a grammatical structure that cannot 
be given a logical foundation. 


In the indirect proof that a straight line can have only one con- 


tinuation through a certain point we make the supposition that a 
straight line could have two continuations. — If we make that

supposition, then the supposition must make sense. — But what 
does it mean to make that supposition ? It isn’t making a supposition 
that goes against natural history, like the supposition that a lion 
has two tails. — It isn’t making a supposition that goes against an 
ascertained fact. What it means is supposing a rule; and there’s 
nothing against that except that it contradicts another rule, and 
for that reason I drop it. 

Suppose that in the proof there occurs the following drawing 
_—_ ‘to represent a straight line bifurcating. 
There is nothing absurd (contradictory) in that unless we have 
made some stipulation that it contradicts. 


If a contradiction is found later on, that means that hitherto the 
rules have not been clear and unambiguous. So the contradiction 
doesn’t matter, because we can now get rid of it by enunciating a 
rule. 


In a system with a clearly set out grammar there are no hidden 
contradictions, because such a system must include the rule which 
makes the contradiction is discernible. A contradiction can only 
be hidden in the sense that it is in the higgledy-piggledy zone of 
the rules, in the unorganized part of the grammar; and there it 
doesn’t matter since it can be removed by organizing the grammar. 


Why may not the rules contradict one another ? Because other- 
wise they wouldn’t be rules.

Justifying arithmetic and preparing it for its applications 
(Russell, Ramsey) 


One always has an aversion to giving arithmetic a foundation 
by saying something about its application. It appears firmly 
enough grounded in itself. And that of course derives from the 
fact that arithmetic is its own application. 


You could say: why bother to limit the application of arithmetic, 
that takes care of itself. (I can make a knife without bothering 
about what kinds of materials I will have cut with it; that will show 
soon enough.) 

What speaks against our demarcating a region of application is 
the feeling that we can understand arithmetic without having any 
such region in mind. Or put it like this: our instinct rebels against 
anything that isn’t restricted to an analysis of the thoughts already 
before us. 


You could say arithmetic is a kind of geometry; i.e. what in 
geometry are constructions on paper in arithmetic are calculations 
(on paper). You could say, it is a more general kind of geometry. 


It is always a question of whether and how far it’s possible to 
represent the most general form of the application of arithmetic. 
And here the strange thing is that in a certain sense it doesn’t seem 
to be needed. And if in fact it isn’t needed, then it’s also impossible. 


The general form of its application seems to be represented by 
the fact that nothing is said about it. (And if that’s a possible repre- 


sentation, then it is also ¢#e right one.) 


The point of the remark that arithmetic is a kind of geometry is 
simply that arithmetical constructions are autonomous like 


306 


geometrical ones and hence so to speak themselves guarantee 
their applicability. 
For it must be possible to say of geometry too that it is its own 


application. 
(In the sense in which we can speak of lines which are possible 


and lines which are actually drawn we can also speak of possible 
and actually represented numbers.) 


ATT 
| 


That is an arithmetical construction, and in a somewhat extended 


sense also a geometrical one. 


Suppose I wish to use this calculation to solve the following 
problem: if I have 11 apples and want to share them among some 
people in such a way that each is given 3 apples how many people 
can there be? The calculation supplies me with the answer 3. Now 
suppose I were to go through the whole process of sharing and at 
the end 4 people each had 3 apples in their hands. Would I then say 
that the computation gave a wrong result ? Of course not. And that 
of course means only that the computation was not an experiment. 

It might look as though the mathematical computation entitled 
us to make a prediction, say, that I could give three people their 
share and there will be two apples left over. But that isn’t so. What 
justifies us in making this prediction is an hypothesis of physics, 
which lies outside the calculation. The calculation is only a study 
of logical forms, of structures, and of itself can’t yield anything 
new. 


If 3 strokes on the paper are the sign for the number 3, then you 
can say the number 3 is to be applied in our language in the way in 
which the 3 strokes can be applied. 


I said “One difficulty in the Fregean theory is the generality of 
the words ‘Concept’ and ‘Object’. For, even if you can count 


307 


tables, tones, vibrations and thoughts, it is difficult to bracket 
them all together.”! But what does “‘you can count them’ mean? 
What it means is that it wakes sense to apply the cardinal numbers to 
them. But if we know that, if we know /hese grammatical rules, 
why do we need to rack our brains about the other grammatical 
rules when we are only concerned to justify the application of 
cardinal arithmetic ? It isn’t difficult “to bracket them all together”; 
so far as is necessary for the present purpose they are already 
bracketed together. 


But (as we all know well) arithmetic isn’t at all concerned about 
this application. Its applicability takes care of itself. 


Hence so far as the foundations of arithmetic are concerned all 
the anxious searching for distinctions between subject-predicate 
forms, and constructing functions ‘in extension’ (Ramsey) is a 
waste of time. 


The equation 4 apples + 4 apples = 8 apples is a substitution rule 
which I use if instead of substituting the sign “8” for the sign 
“4+ 4’, [substitute the sign “8 apples” for the sign “4 + 4 apples.” 

But we must beware of thinking that “4 apples + 4 apples = 8 
apples” is the concrete equation and 4 + 4 = 8 the abstract propo- 
sition of which the former is only a special case, so that the 
arithmetic of apples, though much less general than the truly 
general arithmetic, is valid in its own restricted domain (for apples). 
There isn’t any “arithmetic of apples”, because the equation 4 
apples + 4 apples = 8 apples is not a proposition about apples. We 
may say that in this equation the word “apples”’ has no reference. 
(And we can always say this about a sign in a rule which helps to 
determine its meaning.)

i 


How can we make preparations for the reception of something 
that may happen to exist—in the sense in which Russell and 
Ramsey always wanted to do this? We get logic ready for the 
existence of many-placed relations, or for the existence of an infinite 
number of objects, or the like. 


Well, we can make preparations for the existence of a thing: 
e.g. I may make a casket for jewellery which may be made some 
time or other ~ But in this case I can say what the situation must 
be — what the situation is — for which I am preparing. It is no more 
difficult to describe the situation now than after it has already 
occurred; even, if it never occurs at all. (Solution of mathematical 
problems). But what Russell and Ramsey are making preparations 
for is a possible grammar. 


On the one hand we think that the nature of the functions and of 
the arguments that are counted in mathematics is part of its 
business. But we don’t want to let ourselves be tied down to the 
functions now known to us, and we don’t know whether people 
will ever discover a function with 100 argument places; and so we 
have to make preparations and construct a function to get every- 
thing ready for a 100-place relation in case one turns up. — But 
what does “a roo-place relation turns up (or exists)’ mean at all? 
What concept do we have of one? Or of a 2-place relation for that 
matter? — As an example of a 2-place relation we give something 
like the relation between father and son. But what is the significance 
of this example for the further logical treatment of 2-place relations ? 
Instead of every “‘aRb” are we now to imagine “a is the father of 
b”?-If not, is this example or any example essential? Doesn’t 
this example have the same role as an example in arithmetic, when 
Tuse 3 rows of 6 apples to explain 3 x 6 = 18 to somebody ? 

Here it is a matter of our concept of application. — We have an 
image of an engine which first runs idle, and then works a machine. 


But what does the application add to the calculation? Does it 


309 


introduce a new calculus? In that case it isn’t any longer ¢he same 
calculation. Or does it give it substance in some sense which is 
essential to mathematics (logic) ? If so, how can we abstract from 
the application at all, even only temporarily ? 


No, calculation with apples is essentially the same as calculation 
with lines or numbers. A machine is an extension of an engine, an 
application is not in the same sense an extension of a calculation. 


Suppose that, in order to give an example, I say “love is a 2-place 
relation” — am I saying anything about love? Of course not. I am 
giving a rule for the use of the word “love” and I mean perhaps 
that we use ¢his word in such and such a way. 


Yet we do have the feeling that when we allude to the 2-place 
relation ‘love’ we put meaning into the husk of the calculus of 
relations. — Imagine a geometrical demonstration carried out using 
the cylinder of a lamp instead of a drawing or analytical sym- 
bols. How far is this an application of geometry? Does the use 
of the glass cylinder in the lamp enter into the geometrical thought ? 
And does the use of word “love” in a declaration of love enter into 
my discussions of 2-place relations ? 


We are concerned with different uses or meanings of the word 
“application”. “Division is an application of multiplication”; 
“the lamp is an application of the glass cylinder’’; “the calculation 
is applied to these apples”. 


At this point we can say: arithmetic is its own application. The 
calculus is its own application. 

In arithmetic we cannot make preparations for a grammatical 
application. For if arithmetic is only a game, its application too is 
only a game, and either the same game (in which case it takes us no 
further) or a different game — and in that case we could play it in 
pure arithmetic also. 


310 


So if the logician says that he has made preparations in arithmetic 
for the possible existence of 6-place relations, we may ask him: 
when what you have prepared finds its application, what will be 
added to it? A new calculus? — but that’s something you haven’t 
provided. Or something which doesn’t affect the calculus ? — then 
it doesn’t interest us, and the calculus you have shown us is appli- 
cation enough. 


What is incorrect is the idea that the application of a calculus in 
the grammar of real language correlates it to a reality or gives it a 
reality that it did not have before. 


Here as so often in this area the mistake lies not in believing 
something false, but in looking in the direction of a misleading 
analogy. 


So what happens when the 6-place relation is found? Is it like 
the discovery of a metal that has the desired (and previously 
described) properties (the right specific weight, strength, etc.) ? 
No; what is discovered is a word that we in fact use in our language 
as we used, say, the letter R. “Yes, but this word has meaning, and 
‘R’ has none. So now we see that something can correspond to 
‘R’.” But the meaning of the word does not consist in something’s 
corresponding to it, except in a case like that of a name and what it 
names; but in our case the bearer of the name is merely an extension 
of the calculus, of the language. And it is zo7 like saying “‘this story 
really happened, it was not pure fiction”. 


This is all connected with the false concept of logical analysis 
that Russell, Ramsey and I used to have, according to which we 
ate writing for an ultimate logical analysis of facts, like a chemical 
analysis of compounds ~ an analysis which will enable us really 


to discover a 7-place relation, like an element that really has the 
specific weight 7. 


Grammar is for us a pure calculus (not the application of a 
calculus to reality). 


“How can we make preparations for something which may or 
may not exist ?”’ means: how can we hope to make an a priori con- 
struction to cope with all possible results while basing arithmetic 
upon a logic in which we are still waiting for the results of an 
analysis of our propositions in particular cases? - One wants to 
say: “we don’t know whether it may not turn out that there are no 
functions with 4 argument places, or that there are only 100 
arguments that can significantly be inserted into functions of one 
variable. Suppose, for example (the supposition does appear 
possible) that there is only ove four-place function F and 4 argu- 
ments a, b, c, d; does it make sense in that case to say ‘2+ 2= 4’ 
since there aren’t any functions to accomplish the division into 2 
and 2?” So now, one says to oneself, we will make provision for 
all possible cases. But of course that has no meaning. On the one 
hand the calculus doesn’t make provision for possible existence; 
it constructs for itself all the existence that it needs. On the other 
hand what look like hypothetical assumptions about the logical 
elements (the logical structure) of the world are merely specifica- 
tions of elements in a calculus; and of course you can make these 
in such a way that the calculus does not contain any 2 + 2. 

Suppose we make preparations for the existence of 100 objects 
by introducing 100 names and a calculus to go with them. Then let 
us suppose 100 objects are really discovered. What happens now 
that the names have objects correlated with them which weren’t 
correlated with them before? Does the calculus change? - What 
has the correlation got to do with it at all ? Does it make it acquire 
more reality? Or did the calculus previously belong only to 
mathematics, and now to logic as well? —- What sort of questions 


> 6 


are “are there 3-place relations’’, “‘are there 1000 objects”’ ? How is 


312 


| 
| 
| 
| 
| 


it to be decided ? — But surely it is a fact that we can specify a 2-place 
relation, say love, and a 3-place one, say jealousy, but perhaps not a 
27-place one! — But what does “‘to specify a 2-place relation” mean ? 
It sounds as if we could point to a thing and say “‘you see, that is 
the kind of thing’’ (the kind of thing we described earlier). But 
nothing of that kind takes place (the comparison with pointing is 
altogether wrong). “The relation of jealousy cannot be reduced to 
2-place relationships” sounds like “alcohol cannot be decomposed 
into water plus a solid substance’’. Is that something that is part of 
the nature of jealousy ? (Let’s not forget: the proposition “A is 
jealous of B because of C” is no more and no less reducible than the 
proposition “A is not jealous of B because of C’’.) What is pointed 
to is, say, the group of people A, B and C. — “But suppose that 
living beings at first knew only plane surfaces, but none the 
less developed a 3-dimensional geometry, and that they suddenly 
became acquainted with 3-dimensional space!’ Would this alter 
their geometry, would it become richer in content ? ~ “TIsn’t this the 
way it is? Suppose at some time I had made arbitrary rules for 
myself prohibiting me from moving in my room in certain 
directions where there were no physical hindrances to get in my 
way; and then suppose the physical conditions changed, say 
furniture was put in the room, in such a way as to force me to move 
in accordance with the rules which I had originally imposed on 
myself arbitrarily. Thus, while the 3-dimensional calculus was 
only a game, there weren’t yet three dimensions in reality because 
the x, y, z belonged to the rules only because I had so decided; but 
now that we have linked them up to the real 3 dimensions, no 
other movements are possib/e for them.” But that is pure fiction. 
There isn’t any question here of a connection with reality which 
keeps grammar on the rails. The “connection of language with 
reality”, by means of ostensive definitions and the like, doesn’t 
make the grammar inevitable or provide a justification for the 
grammar. The grammar remains a free-floating calculus which 
can only be extended and never supported. The “connection with 


313 


reality” merely extends language, it doesn’t force anything on it. 
We speak of discovering a 27-place relation but on the one hand 
no discovery can force me to use the sign or the calculus for a 
27-place relation, and on the other hand I can describe the operation 
of the calculus itself simply by using this notation. 


When it looks in logic as if we are discussing several different 
universes (as with Ramsey), in reality we are considering different 
games. The definition of a “universe” in a case like Ramsey’s 


would simply be a definition like 


(4x). ox = ga v ob Vv gc vy od. 


314

Ramsey's theory of identity 


Ramsey’s theory of identity makes the mistake that would be 
made by someone who said that you could use a painting as a 
mirror as well, even if only for a single posture. If we say this we 
overlook that what is essential to a mirror is precisely that you can 
infer from it the posture of a body in front of it, whereas in the-case 
of the painting you have to know that the postures tally before you 
can construe the picture as a mirror image. 


If Dirichlet’s conception of function has a strict sense, it must 
be expressed in a definition that uses the table to define the function- 
signs as equivalent. 


Ramsey defines' x = y as 


(Ge) PeX = FeV 
But according to the explanations he gives of his function-sign 


(-)- eX = ¢,x is the statement: “every sentence is equivalent to 
itself.” 
(Ge). eX = oy is the statement: “every sentence is equivalent to 


every sentence.” 
So all he has achieved by his definition is what is laid down by the 
two definitions 


ae Tautology 
Def 
x=y. = 


>> 


Contradiction 


(Here the word “tautology”? can be replaced by any arbitrary 
tautology, and similarly with “contradiction’’). So far all that has 
happened is that definitions have been given of the two distinct 
signs x = x and x = y. These definitions could of course be replaced 
by two sets of definitions, e.g. 


a=a a 
b=b = Taut. b=c $ =Contr. 
c=c c=a 


1. F. P. Ramsey, The Foundations of Mathematics, London 1931, p. 53. 
315 


But then Ramsey writes: 


“(dx,y).x#y”, ie. “(ax,y). ~(x=y)”- 


but he has no right to: for what does the “x = y” mean in this 
expression? It is neither the sign “x = y’’ used in the definition 
above, nor of course the “‘x = x” in the preceding definition. So it 
is a sign that is still unexplained. Moreover to see the futility of 
these definitions, you should read them (as an unbiased person 
would) as follows: I permit the sign ““Taut”, whose use we know, 
to be replaced by the sign “a =a” or “b=b’”, etc.; and the sign 
“Contr.” (“~Taut.”) to be replaced by the sign “a=b” or “a=c’, 
etc. From which, incidentally, it follows that (a= b)=(c=d)= 
(a # a) =etc.! 

It goes without saying that an identity sign defined like that has 
no resemblance to the one we use to express a substitution rule. 

Of course I can go on to define “(dx, y).x # y”, say as 
afa.v.a#xb.v.b#c.v.a¥#c; but this definition is pure hum- 
bug and I should have written straightaway (4x,y).x# y. =. Taut. 
(That is, I would be given the sign on the left side as a new - 
unnecessary — sign for ““Taut.’’) For we mustn’t forget that accord- 
ing to the definitions ‘“‘a = a’’, ‘‘a = b”, etc. are independent signs, 
no more connected with each other than the signs ‘““Taut.” and 
“Contr.” themselves. 

What is in question here is whether functions in extension are 
any use; because Ramsey’s explanation of the identity sign is just 
such a specification by extension. Now what exactly is the specifi- 
cation of a function by its extension? Obviously, it is a group of 
definitions, e.g. 


fa=p Def. 
fbh=q Def. 
fe=r Def. 


These definitions permit us to substitute for the known proposi- 
tions “p’’, “q’’, “r” the signs “fa” “fb” “fc”. To say that these 
three definitions determine the function f£(€) is either to say 


nothing, or to say the same as the three definitions say. 


316 


i] 
4 


For the signs “fa” “fb” “‘fc’’ are no more function and argument 
than the words “‘Co(rn)’’, “Co(al)” and “Co(It)” are. (Here it makes 
no difference whether or not the ‘“‘arguments”’ “‘rn’’, “al’’, “‘It’’ are 
used elsewhere as words). 

(So it is hard to see what purpose the definitions can have except 
to mislead us.) 

To begin with, the sign “(4x). fx” has no meaning; because here 
the rules for functions in the old sense of the word don’t hold at all. 
According to them a definition like fa =... would be nonsense. 
If no explicit definition is given for it, the sign “(4x).fx” can only 
be understood as a rebus in which the signs have some kind of 

g 
spurious meaning. 
Each of the signs “a=a’, “a=c’”, etc. in the definitions 
g > > 


(a=a). 2" |Taut. etc. is a word. 

Moteover, the purpose of the introduction of functions in 
extension was to analyse propositions about infinite extensions, and 
it fails of this purpose when a function in extension is introduced 
by a list of definitions. 


There is a temptation to regard the form of an equation as the 
form of tautologies and contradictions, because it looks as if one 
can say that x =x is self-evidently true and x=y self-evidently 
false. The comparison between x = x and a tautology is of course 
better than that between x= y and a contradiction, because all 
correct (and “‘significant’’) equations of mathematics are actually 
of the form x=y. We might call x=x a degenerate equation 
(Ramsey quite correctly called tautologies and contradictions 
degenerate propositions) and indeed a correct degenerate equation 
(the limiting case of an equation). For we use expressions of the 
form x = x like correct equations, and when we do so we are fully 
conscious that we are dealing with degenerate equations. In 
geometrical proofs there are propositions in the same case, such as 
“the angle « is equal to the angle B , the angle y is equal to itself . . .” 

At this point the objection might be made that correct equations 
of the form x = y must be tautologies, and incorrect ones contra- 
dictions, because it must be possible to prove a correct equation 


317 


Ss 


by transforming each side of it until an identity of the form x = x 
is reached. But although the original equation is shown to be correct 
by this process, and to that extent the identity x = x is the goal of 
the transformation, it is not its goal in the sense that the purpose 
of the transformation is to give the equation its correct form — 
like bending a crooked object straight; it is not that the equation 
at long last achieves its perfect form in the identity. So we can’t say: 
a correct equation is rea//y an identity. It just ésn’t an identity. 


318

17 
The concept of the application of arithmetic! (mathematics) 


If we say “it must be essential to mathematics that it can be 
applied’? we mean that its applicabi/ity isn’t the kind of thing I 
mean of a piece of wood when I say “I will be able to find many 
applications for it’. 


Geometry isn’t the science (natural science) of geometric planes, 
lines and points, as opposed to some other science of gross 
physical lines, stripes and surfaces and ¢he7r properties. The relation 
between geometry and propositions of practical life, about stripes, 
colour boundaries, edges and corners, etc. isn’t that the things 
geometty speaks of, though idea/ edges and corners, resemble 
those spoken of in practical propositions; it is the relation between 
those propositions and their grammar. Applied geometry is the 
grammar of statements about spatial objects. The relation between 
what is called a geometrical line and a boundary between two 
colours isn’t like the relation between something fine and some- 
thing coarse, but like the relation between possibility and actuality. 
(Think of the notion of possibility as a shadow of actuality.) 


You can describe a circular surface divided diametrically into 8 
congruent parts, but it is senseless to give such a description of an 
elliptical surface. And that contains all that geometry says in this 
connexion about circular and elliptical surfaces. 


(A proposition based on a wrong calculation (such as “he cut a 
3-metre board into 4 one metre parts’’) is nonsensical, and that 
throws light on what is meant by “‘making sense” and “‘meaning 
something by a proposition”’.) 


1. The section does not mention arithmetic. It may be conjectured that it was 
never completed. (Ed.) 


319 


What about the proposition “the sum of the angles of a triangle 
is 180 degrees’’? At all events you can’t tell by looking at it that it 
is a proposition of syntax. 

The proposition “corresponding angles are equal” means that if 
they don’t appear equal when they ate measured I will treat the 
measurement as incorrect; and “the sum of the angles of a 
triangle is 180 degrees”’ means that if it doesn’t appear to be 180 
degrees when they are measured I will assume there has been a 
mistake in the measurement. So the proposition is a postulate 
about the method of describing facts, and therefore a proposition 
of syntax. 


320 


IV ON CARDINAL NUMBERS 


18 
Kinds of cardinal number 


What are numbers? — What numerals signify; an investigation 
of what they signify is an investigation of the grammar of numerals. 


What we are looking for is not a definition of the concept of 
number, but an exposition of the grammar of the word “number” 
and of the numerals. 


The reason why there are infinitely many cardinal numbers, is 
that we construct this infinite system and call it the system of 
cardinal numbers. There is also a number system “1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
many” and even a system “‘r, 2, 3, 4, 5”. Why shouldn’t I call that 
too a system of catdinal numbers (a finite one) ? 


It is clear that the axiom of infinity is not what Russell took it 
for; it is neither a proposition of logic, nor-—as it stands —a 
proposition of physics. Perhaps the calculus to which it belongs, 
transplanted into quite different surroundings (with a quite 
different “interpretation’”), might somewhere find a practical 
application; I do not know. 

One might say of logical concepts (e.g. of the, or a, concept of 
infinity) that their essence proves their existence. 


(Frege would still have said: “perhaps there are people who have 
not got beyond the first five in their acquaintance with the series of 
cardinal numbers (and see the rest of the series only in an indeter- 
minate form or something of the kind), but this series exists inde- 
pendently of us”. Does chess exist independently of us, or not ? -) 


Here is a very interesting question about the position of the 
concept of number in logic: what happens to the concept of 


321 


number if a society has no numerals, but for counting, calculating, 
etc. uses exclusively an abacus like a Russian abacus ? 

(Nothing would be mote interesting than to investigate the 
arithmetic of such people; it would make one really understand 
that here there is no distinction between 20 and 21.) 


Could we also imagine, in contrast with the cardinal numbers, a 
kind of number consisting of a series like the cardinal numbers 
without the 5? Certainly; but this kind of number couldn’t be 
used for any of the things for which we use the cardinal numbers. 
The way in which these numbers are missing a five is not like the 
way in which an apple may have been taken out of a box of apples 
and can be put back again; it is of their essence to lack a 5; they 
do not now the 5 (in the way that the cardinal numbers do not 
know the number 4). So these numbers (if you want to call them 
that) would be used in cases where the cardinal numbers (with the 
5) couldn’t meaningfully be used. 

(Doesn’t the nonsensicality of the talk of the “basic intuition” 
show itself here ?) 


When the intuitionists speak of the “basic intuition” — is this a 
psychological process ? If so, how does it come into mathematics ? 
Isn’t what they mean only a primitive sign (in Frege’s sense); an 
element of a calculus ? 


Strange as it sounds, it is possible to know the prime numbers — 
let’s say — only up to 7 and thus to have a finite system of prime 
numbers. And what we call the discovery that there are infinitely 
many primes is in truth the discovery of a new system with no 
greater rights than the other. 


If you close your eyes and see countless glimmering spots of 
light coming and going, as we might say, it doesn’t make sense to 
speak of a ‘number’ of simultaneously seen dots. And you can’t 
say “there is always a definite number of spots of light there, we 


322 


just don’t know what it is’; that would correspond to a rule 
applied in a case where you can speak of checking the number. 


(It makes sense to say: I divide many among many. But the 
proposition “I couldn’t divide the many nuts among the many 
people” can’t mean that it was logically impossible. Also you can’t 
say “in some cases it is possible to divide many among many and in 
others not”; for in that case I ask: in which cases is this possible and 
in which impossible? And to that no further answer can be given 
in the many-system.) 


To say of a part of my visual field that it has no colour is non- 
sense; and of course it is equally nonsense to say that it has colour 
(or a colour). On the other hand it makes sense to say it has only one 
colour (is monochrome, or axiform in colour) or that it has at least 
two colours, only two colours, etc. 

So in the sentence “this square in my visual field has at least two 
colours” I cannot substitute ‘“‘one” for “two”. Or again: “the 
square has only one colour” does not mean — on the analogy of 
(ax). px. ~ (4x, y) 9x. ey — “the square has one colour but not 
two colours”’. 


I am speaking here of the case in which it is senseless to say “that 
part of space has no colour”. If I am counting the uniformly 
coloured (monochrome) patches in the square, it does incidentally 
make sense to say that there aren’t any there at all, if the colour of 
the square is continually changing. In that case of course it also 
makes sense to say that there are one or more uniformly coloured 
patches in the square and also that the square has one colour and 
not two. — But for the moment I am disregarding that use of the 
sentence “the square has no colour” and am speaking of a system 
in which it would be called a matter of course that an area of a 
surface had a colour, a system, therefore, in which strictly speaking 
there is no such proposition. If you call the proposition self-evi- 
dent you really mean something that is expressed by a grammatical 
tule giving the form of propositions about visual space, for 


323 


instance. If you now begin the series of statements giving the 
number of colours in the square with the proposition “there is one 
colour in the square”’, then of course that mustn’t be the propo- 
sition of grammar about the “colouredness” of space. 

What do you mean if you say “space is coloured” ? (And, a very 
interesting question: what kind of question is this ?) Well, perhaps 
you look around for confirmation and look at the different colours 
around you and feel the inclination to say: “wherever I look there 
is a colour”’, or “‘it’s all coloured, all as it were painted.” Here you 
are imagining colours in contrast to a kind of colourlessness, which 
on closer inspection turns into a colour itself. Incidentally, when 
you look around for confirmation you look first and foremost at 
static and monochromatic parts of space, rather than at unstable 
unclearly coloured parts (flowing water, shadows, etc.) If you then 
have to admit that you call just everything that you see colour, what 
you want to say is that being coloured is a property of space in 
itself, not of the parts of space. But that comes to the same as saying 
of chess that it is chess; and at best it can’t amount to more than a 
description of the game. So what we must do is describe spatial 

Propositions; but we can’t justify them, as if we had to bring them 
into agreement with an independent reality. 

In order to confirm the proposition “the visual field is coloured” 
one looks round and says “that there is black, and black is a 
colour; that is white, and white is a colour”, etc. And one regards 
“black is a colour” as like “iron is a metal” (or perhaps better, 
“gypsum is a sulphur compound”), 

If I make it senseless to say that a part of the visual field has a 
colour, then asking for the analysis of a statement assigning the 
number of colours in a part of the visual space becomes very like 
asking for the analysis of a statement of the number of parts of a 
rectangle that I divide up into parts by lines. 

Here too I can regard it as senseless to say that the rectangle 
“consists of no parts’. Hence, one cannot say that it consists of 
one or more parts, or that it has at least one part. Imagine the 
special case of a rectangle divided by parallel lines. It doesn’t 
matter that this is a very special case, since we don’t regard a game 
as less remarkable just because it has only a very limited applica- 


324 


tion. Here I can if I want count the parts in the usual manner, and 
then it is meaningless to say there are o parts. But I could also 
imagine a way of counting which so to say 
regards the first part as a matter of course 


o 1 2 : 
and doesn’t count it or counts it as o, and 

, counts only the parts which are added to 

this by division. Again, one could imagine 

E a custom according to which, say, soldiers 
| in rank and file were always counted by 


giving the number of soldiers in a line over 
and above the first soldier (perhaps because we wanted the number 
of possible combinations of the fugleman with another soldier 
of the rank.). But a custom might also exist of always giving the 
number of soldiers as 1 greater than the real one. Perhaps this 
happened originally in order to deceive a particular officer about 
the real number, and later came into general use asa way of counting 
soldiers. (The academic quarter)! The number of different colours 
on a surface might also be given by the number of their possible 
combinations in pairs and in that case the only numbers that would 
count would be numbers of the form 3(n— 1); it would be as 
senseless then to talk of the 2 or 4 colours of a surface as it now is to 
talk of the V2 or i colours. I want to say that it is not the case that 
the cardinal numbers are essentially primary and what we might 
call the combination numbers — 1, 2, 6, 10 etc. — are secondary. We 
might construct an arithmetic of the combination numbers and it 
would be as self-contained as the arithmetic of the cardinal num- 
bers. But equally of course there might be an arithmetic of the 
even numbers or of the numbers 1, 3, 4, 5,6, 7-.+ Of course the 
decimal system is ill-adapted for the writing of these kinds of 
number. 


Imagine a calculating machine that calculates not with beads 
but with colours on a strip of paper. Just as we now use our 
fingers, or the beads on an abacus, to count the colours on a strip 


1. This is an allusion to the German academic custom of announcing a lecture 
. . > 
for, say, 11.15 by scheduling it “11.00 c.t.’ (Trs.) 


325 


|

so then we would use the colours ona strip to count the beads ona 
bar or the fingers on our hand. But how would this colour-calcu- 
lating machine have to be made in order to work? We would 
need a sign for there being no bead on the bar. We must imagine 
the abacus as a practical tool and as an instrument in language. Just 
as we can now fepresent a number like 5 by the five fingers of a 
hand (imagine a gesture language) so we would then represent it 
by a sttip with five colours. But I need a sign for the 0, otherwise 
I do not have the necessary multiplicity. Well, I can either stipulate 
that a black surface is to denote the o (this is of course arbitrary and 
a monochromatic red surface would do just as well): or that any 
one-coloured surface is to denote zero, a two-coloured surface 1 
etc. It is immaterial which method of denotation I choose. Her 
we see how the multiplicity of the beads is projected onto the 
multiplicity of the colours on a sutface. 


It makes no sense to speak of a black two-sided figure in a white 


circle; this is analogous toits being senseless to say that the rectangle 


consists of o parts (no part). Here we have something like a lower 
limit of counting before we reach the number one.

Is counting parts in I the same as counting points in IV? What 
makes the difference? We may regard counting the parts in I as 
counting rectangles; but in that case one can also say: “in this row 
there is zo rectangle”; and then one isn’t counting parts. We are 
disturbed both by the analogy between counting the points and 
counting the parts, and by the breakdown of the analogy. 

There is something odd in counting the undivided surface as 
“one’’; on the other hand we find no difficulty in seeing the surface 
after a single division as a picture of 2. Here we would much 
prefer to count “o, 2, 3”, etc. And this corresponds to the series 
of propositions “the rectangle is undivided”, “the rectangle is 
divided into 2 parts”’, etc. 


If it’s a question of different colours, you can imagine a way of 
thinking in which you don’t say that here we have two colours, 
but that here we have a distinction between colours; a style of 
thought which does not see 3 at all in red, green and yellow; which 
does indeed recognise as a series a series like: red; blue, green; 
yellow, black, white; etc., but doesn’t connect it with the series 
3 [|5 || [5 ete., or not in such a way as to correlate | with the term 
red. 


From the point of view from which it is ‘odd’ to count the 
undivided surface as one, it is also natural to count the singly 
divided one as two. That is what one does if one regards it as two 
rectangles, and that would mean looking at it from the standpoint 
from which the undivided one might well be counted as one 
rectangle. But if one regards the first rectangle in 1 as the undivided 
surface, then the second appears as a whole with one division (one 
distinction) and division here does not necessarily mean dividing 
line. What I am paying attention to is the distinctions, and here 
there is a series of an increasing number of distinctions. In that 
case I will count the rectangles in I “‘o, 1, 2, etc.” 


This is all right where the colours ona strip border on each other, 


as in the schema oreen white 


327 


But it is different if the arrangement is eta 
PSE 


or|wig[w]rlg|r]. Of course I might also correlate 


each of these two schemata with the schema | w] g] r| 


the schema | w | g | r | bl] , etc. And that way of thinking though 


certainly unnatural is perfectly correct. 

The most natural thing is to conceive the series of schemata as 
A 
A B 
A BC 

A BCD 
etc. And here we may denote the first schema by ‘o’, the second by 
“1”, but the third say with ‘3’, if we think of all possible distinc- 
tions, and the fourth by ‘6’ Or we may call the third schema ‘2’ 
(if we are concerned simply with az arrangement) and the fourth ‘3’. 


and correlate schemata like 


We can describe the way a rectangle is divided by saying: it is 
divided into five parts, or: 4 parts have been cut off it, or: its 
division-schema is ABCDE, or: you can reach every part by 
crossing four boundaries or: the rectangle is divided (i.e. into 2 
parts), one part is divided again, and both 
parts of this part divided, etc. I want to exe 
show that there isn’t only ome method of 
describing the way it is divided. ax 


328 


But perhaps we might refrain altogether from using a number to 
denote the distinction and keep solely to the schemata A, AB, 
ABC, etc.; or we might describe it like this: 1, 12, 123 etc., or, what 
comes to the same, 0, o1, o12 etc. 

We may very well call these too numerals. 


The schemata A, AB, ABC etc., |, ||, |||, etc.; fia] : [1] , 


11] frit] etc.; 0, I, 2, 3, etc.; I, 2, 3, etcC.; I, 12, 121323, etc.,

etc., are all equally fundamental. 


We are surprised that the number-schema by which we count 
soldiers in a barracks isn’t supposed also to hold for the parts of a 
rectangle. But the schema for the soldiers in the barracks is 


en [- | [--] etc., the one for the parts of the rectangle is 

’ ’ ? 

oe fale] (TU etc. Neither is primary in comparison 
’ ’ ’ 


with the other. 

I can compare the series of division-schemata with the series 
I, 2, 3, etc. as well as with the series 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. 

If I count the parts, then there is no o in my number series 


because the series 
A 


A B 
A BC 
etc. begins with one letter whereas the series {| : L-] : [--] ; 


etc. does not begin with ove dot. On the other hand, I can represent 
any fact about the division by this series too, only in that case 
“Tm not counting the parts”. 


A way of expressing the problem which, though incorrect, is 
natural is: why can one say “there are 2 colours on this surface” but 
not “there is one colour on this surface ?”? Or: how must I express 
the grammatical rule so that it is obvious and so that [’m not any 
longer tempted to talk nonsense ? Where is the false thought, the 


329 


false analogy by which I am misled into misusing language? How 
must I set out the grammar so that this temptation ceases? I 
think that setting it out by means of the series 


ie a 


A B 
A BC and (-] 
and so on [--] 
and so on 


removes the unclarity. 

What matters is whether in order to count I use a number series 
that begins with o or one that begins with 1. 

It is the same if I am counting the lengths of sticks or the size of 
hats. 


If I counted with strokes, I might write them thus | ; V ; 


NYA Zz in order to show that what matters is the distinction 
3 ’ 


between the directions and that a simple stroke corresponds to 
o (i.e. is the beginning). 


Here incidentally there is a certain difficulty about the numerals 
(1), (2) + 1), etc.: beyond a certain length we cannot distinguish 
them any further without counting the strokes, and so without 
translating the signs into different ones. “|||{|||{||’? and “|{{[|{[||||’’ 
cannot be distinguished in the same sense as 10 and 11, and so 
they aren’t in the same sense distinct signs. The same thing could 
also happen incidentally in the decimal system (think of the 
numbers 1111111111 and 11111111111), and that is not without 
significance. 


Imagine someone giving us a sum to do ina stroke-notation, say 
HHLTLITLTL + THIET ||, amd, while we are calculating, amusing himself 
by removing and adding strokes without our noticing. He would 
keep on saying: “but the sum isn’t right”, and we would keep going 
through it again, fooled every time. — Indeed, strictly speaking, 
we wouldn’t have any concept of a criterion for the correctness of 
the calculation. 


330 


Here one might raise questions like: is it only very probable that 
464 + 272 = 736? And in that case isn’t 2+ 3 = 35 also only very 
probable? And where is the objective truth which this probability 
approaches? That is, how do we get a concept of 2 + 3’s really 
being a certain number, apart from what it seems to us to be? 


For if it were asked: what is the criterion in the stroke-notation 
for our having the same numeral in front of us twice ? — the answer 
might be: “if it looks the same both times”’ or “‘if it contains the 
same number of lines both times”. Or should it be: if a one-one 
correlation etc. is possible? 


How can I know that |||||||{|| amd {|||||||{| are the same sign? 
After all it is not enough that they look a/ke. For having roughly 
the same gestalt can’t be what is to constitute the identity of the 
signs, but just their being the same in number. 


(The problem of the distinction between 1+ 1+1+1+1+41 
+randr+1+i+1+1+1+1-41 is much more fundamental 
than appears at first sight. It is a matter of the distinction between 
physical and visual number.)

A cardinal number is an internal property of a list. Are num- 
bers essentially concerned with concepts? I believe this amounts 
to asking whether it makes sense to ascribe a number to objects 
that haven’t been brought under a concept. Does it, for example, 
make sense to say “a, b and c are three objects’’? — Admittedly 
we have a feeling: why talk about concepts, the number of 
course depends only on the extension of the concept, and once 
that has been determined the concept may drop out of the picture. 
The concept is only a method for determining an extension, but 
the extension is autonomous and, in its essence, independent of the 
concept; for it’s quite immaterial which concept we have used to 
determine the extension. That is the argument for the extensional 
viewpoint. The immediate objection to it is: if a concept is really 
only an expedient for aiming at an extension, then there is no place 
for concepts in arithmetic; in that case we must simply divorce a 
class completely from the concept which happens to be associated 
with it. But if it isn’t like that, then an extension independent of the 
concept is just a chimaera, and in that case it’s better not to speak of 
it at all, but only of the concept. 

The sign for the extension of a concept is a list. We might say, 
as an approximation, that a number is an external property of a 
concept and an internal property of its extension (the list of 
objects that fall under it). A number is a schema for the extension 
of a concept. That is, as Frege said, a statement of number is a 
statement about a concept (a predicate). It’s not about the extension 
of a concept, i.e. a list that may be something like the extension of a 
concept. But a number-statement about a concept has a similarity 
to a proposition saying that a determinate list is the extension of 
the concept. I use such a list when I say “‘a, b, c, d, fall under the 
concept F(x)’’: “a, b, c, d,”’ is the list. Of course this proposition 


332 


says the same as Fa.Fb.Fc.Fd; but the use of the list in writing 
the proposition shows its relationship to “(4x, y, z, u). Fx. Fy. Fz. 
Fu” which we can abbreviate as “(]|||x).F(x).” 

What arithmetic is concerned with is the schema |||]. - But 
does arithmetic talk about the lines that I draw with pencil on 
paper? — Arithmetic doesn’t talk about the lines, it operates with 
them. 


A statement of number doesn’t always contain a generalization 
or indeterminacy: “The line AB is divided into 2 (3, 4, etc.) equal 
parts.” 


If you want to know what 2 + 2 = 4 means, you have to ask how 
we work it out. That means that we consider the process of 
calculation as the essential thing; and that’s how we look at the 
matter in ordinary life, at least as far as concerns the numbers that 
we have to work out. We mustn’t feel ashamed of regarding 
numbers and sums in the same way as the everyday arithmetic 
of every trader. In everyday life we don’t work out 2+ 2 = 4 or 
any of the rules of the multiplication table; we take them for 
granted like axioms and ase them to calculate. But of course we 
could work out 2 + 2 = 4and children in fact do so by counting off.

333 


Does that prove the arithmetical proposition 2+ 3 = 5? Of 
course not. It does not even show that 
(e| |x). px.(e|||x).px.Ind.. > .(e|| + |||x).ex Vv yx is tautologous, 
because nothing was said in our definitions about a sum (|| + |||). 
(I will write the tautology in the abbreviated form “e{|.e|||.>. 
e|||||”’.) Suppose the question is, given a left hand side, to find what 
number of lines to the right of “>” makes the whole a tautology. 
We can find the number, we can indeed discover that in the case 
above it is || + |||; but we can equally well discover that it is 
}+|||| or | + {|| +], for it is all of these. We can also find an 
inductive proof that the algebraic expression 

en.em.2.en+m 
is tautologous. Then I have a right to regard a proposition like 
€17.€28. D.e(17 + 28) 

as a tautology. But does that give us the equation 17 + 28 = 45? 
Certainly not. I still have to work it out. In accordance with this 
general rule, it also makes sense to write 2.3. .e5 asa tautology 
if, as it were, I don’t yet know what 2 + 3 yields; for 2 + 3 only has 
sense in so far as it has still to be worked out. 

Hence the equation || + ||| =||||| only has a point if the sign 
“‘|||||?? can be recognised in the same way as the sign “5”, that is, 
independently of the equation. 


The difference between my point of view and that of contem- 
porary writers on the foundations of arithmetic is that I am not 
obliged to despise particular calculi like the decimal system. For 
me one calculus is as good as another. To look down ona particular 
calculus is like wanting to play chess without real pieces, because 
playing with pieces is too particularized and not abstract enough. 
If the pieces really don’t matter then one lot is just as good as 
another. And if the games are really distinct from each other, then 
one game is as good, i.e. as interesting, as the other. None of them 
is more sublime than any other. 


334 


Which proof of e||.|||. >-.||||| expresses our knowledge that 
this is a correct logical proposition ? 

Obviously, one that makes use of the fact that one can treat 
(4x)... as a logical sum. We may translate from a symbolism like 


(‘if there is a star in each square, then there are two 


in the whole rectangle’’) into the Russellian one. And it isn’t as if 
the tautologies in that notation expressed an idea that is confirmed 
by the proof after first of all appearing merely plausible; what 
appears plausible to us is that this expression is a tautology (a law 
of logic). 


The series of propositions 
(dx): aRx.xRb 
(dx, y):aRx.xRy.yRb 
(Ax, y,z):aRx.xRy.yRz.zRb, etc. 
may perfectly well be expressed as follows: 

“There is one term between a and b”. 

“There are two terms between a and b’’, etc., 
and may be written in some such way as: 

(dix).aRxRb, (d2x).aRxRb, etc. 

But it is clear that in order to understand this expression we need 
the explanation above, because otherwise by analogy with 
(2x). px .= .(4x, y).ex.gy you might believe that (Jzx).aRxRb 
was equivalent to the expression (4x, y).aRxRb.aRyRb. 

Of course I might also write ‘“(d2x, y).F(x, y)” instead of 
“(Ax, y). F(x, y)”’. But then the question would be: what am I to take 
*<(43x, y).F(x, y)” as meaning ? But here a rule can be given; and 
indeed we need one that takes us further in the number series as far 
as we want to go. E.g.: 

(43x, y). F(x, y). = .(4x, y, z): F(x, y). F(x, z). Fy, z) 

(44x, y). F(x, y). = .(4x, y, z, u): F(x, y). F(x,z).... 
followed by the combinations of two elements, and so on. But 
we might also give the following definition: 

(43x, y). F(x, y). = .(4x, y, z): F(x, y). F(y, x). F(x, z). 

F(z, x). F(y,z).F(x,y), andsoon. 


I 


335 


ca = crams pe rennememn aetna mi 


“(43 x, y). F(x, y)” would perhaps correspond to the propo- 
sition in word-language “F(x, y) is satisfied by 3 things”; and that 
proposition too would need an explanation if it was not to be 
ambiguous. 

Am I now to say that in these different cases the sign “3” has 
different meanings ? Isn’t it rather that the sign “3” expresses whatis 
common to the different interpretations ? Why else would I have 
chosen it ? Certainly, in each of these contexts, the same rules hold 
for the sign ‘3”’. It is replaceable by 2 + 1 as usual and so on. But 
at all events a proposition on the pattern of e||.¢|||. > .e||||| is no 
longer a tautology. Two men who live at peace with each other and 
three other men who live at peace with each other do not make five 
men who live at peace with each other. But that does not mean that 
2+ 3 ate no longer 5; it is just that addition cannot be applied 
in that way. For one might say: 2men who... and3 men who..., 
each of whom lives at peace with each of the first group, = 5 men 
who... 

In other words, the signs of the form (41x, y). F(x, y), (42x, y). 
F(x, y) etc. have the same multiplicity as the cardinal numbers, like 
the signs (41x). ox, (42x). x, etc. and also like the signs (e1x). 9x, 
(e2x). x, etc. 


“There are only 4 red things, but they don’t consist of 2 and 2, 
as there is no function under which they fall in pairs”. That would 
mean regarding the proposition 2 + 2 = 4 thus: if you can see 4 
circles on a surface, every two of them always have a particular 
property in common; say a sign inside the circle. (In that case of 
course every three of the circles too will have to have a sign in 

common etc.) If lam to make any assump- 
tion at all about reality, why not that? The 
‘axiom of reducibility’ is essentially the same 
kind of thing. In this sense one might say 
that 2 and 2 do always make 4, but 4 doesn’t 
always consist of 2 and 2. (It is only because 
of the utter vagueness and generality of the 
axiom of reducibility that we are seduced 


36 


w 


into believing that — if it is a significant sentence at all — it is more 
than an arbitrary assumption for which there is no ground. For 
this reason, in this and all similar cases, it is very illuminating to 
drop this generality, which doesn’t make the matter any more 
mathematical, and in its place to make very specific assumptions.) 


We feel like saying: 4 does not always have to consist of 2 and 2, 
but if it does consist of groups it can consist of 2 and 2, or of 3 and 
1 etc.; but not of 2 and 1 or 3 and 2, etc. In that way we get every- 
thing prepared in case 4 is actually divisible into groups. But in 
that case arithmetic doesn’t have anything to do with the actual 
division, but only with the possibility of division. The assertion 
might just as well be the assertion that any two of a group of 4 dots 
on paper are always joined by a line. 

Or that around every 2 such groups of 2 dots in the real world 
there is always a circle drawn. 


Add to this that a statement like “‘you can see two black circles 
in a white rectangle”’ doesn’t have the form “‘(x, y), etc.’’. For, if 
I give the circles names, the names refer to the precise location of 
the circles and I can’t say of them that they are either in this 
rectangle or in the other. I can indeed say “‘there are 4 circles in both 
rectangles taken together” but that doesn’t mean that I can say of 
each individual circle that it is in one rectangle or the other. For 
in the case supposed the sentence “‘this circle is in this rectangle”’ is 
senseless. 


But what does the proposition “there are 4 circles in the 2 
rectangles taken /ogether’” mean? How do I establish that? By 
adding the numbers in each? In that case the number of the circles 
in the two rectangles means the result of the addition of the two 
numbers. — Or is it something like the result of taking a count 
through both rectangles ? Or the number of lines I get if I correlate 
a line to a circle no matter whether it is in this rectangle or in the

other ? If “this circle” is individuated by its position, we can say 
“every line is correlated either to a circle in this rectangle or to a 
circle in the other rectangle” but not “this circle is either in this 


rectangle or in the other”. Tis can only be ere if “this” and “here” 
do not mean the same. By contrast ¢bis line can be correlated to a 
circle in this rectangle because it remains this line, even if it is 
correlated to a circle in the other rectangle. 


In these two circles together are there 9 dots or 7? As one nor- 
mally understands the question, 7. But must I understand it so? 
Why shouldn’t I count twice the points that are common to both 
circles ? 


It is a different matter if we ask “Show many dots are within the 
black lines ?”’ For here I can say: in the sense in which there are 5 
and 4 in the circles, there are 7. 


338 


Now we might say: by the sum of 4 and 5 I mean the number 
of the objects which fall under the concept ox v x, if it is the case 
that (E 4x)!.ox.(E 5x).yx.Ind. That doesn’t mean that the sum 
of 4 and 5 may only be used in the context of propositions like 
(4 4x). x; it means: if you want to construct the sum of n and m, 
insert the numbers on the left hand side of “>” in the form 
(Anx). px.(Imx).px, etc., and the sum of m and n will be the 
number which has to go on the right hand side in order to make the 
whole proposition a tautology. So that is a method of addition - 
a very long-winded one. 

Compare: “Hydrogen and oxygen yield water’’, “2 dots and 3 
dots yield 5 dots’’. 


So do e.g. 2 dots in my visual field, that I “‘see as 4” and not 
“as 2 and 2”, consist of 2 and 2? Well, what does that mean? Is it 
asking whether in some way they are divided into groups of 2 
dots each? Of course not (for in that case they would presumably 
have had to be divided in all other conceivable ways as well). 
Does it mean that they can be divided into groups of 2 and 2, i.e. 
that it makes sense to speak of such groups in the four ? - At any rate 
it does correspond to the sentence 2 + 2 = 4 that I can’t say that 
the group of 4 dots I saw consisted of separate groups of 2 and 3. 
Everyone will say: that’s impossible, because 3+2=5. (And 
“impossible” here means “‘nonsensical”’.) 


“Do 4 dots consist of 2 and 2?” may be a question about a 
physical or visual fact; for it isn’t the question in arithmetic. The 


1. For the explanation of this notation, see below, p. 343 f. 


339 


arithmetical question, however, certainly could be put in the form: 
“Cana group of 4 dots consist of separate groups of 2°?” 


“Suppose that I used to believe that there wasn’t anything at all 
except one function and the 4 objects that satisfy it. Later I realise 
that it is satisfied by a fifth thing too: does this make the sign ‘4’ 
become senseless 2?” — Well, if there is no 4 in the calculus then ‘4’ 
is senseless. 


If you say it would be possible when adding to make use of the 
tautology (E 2x).9x.(E 3x).0x. Ind. >.( E 5x).oxvdx ... A) 
this is how it would have to be understood: first it is possible to 
establish according to certain rules that(E x). 9x.(E x).x.Ind..>. 
(Ex, y): 9x v bx. py v vy. is tautological. (E x). ox is an abbrevia- 
tion for (4x).ox. ~ (4x, y).ox.ey. I will abbreviate further 
tautologies like A thus: (E).(E).>.(E) 

Therefore 

(Ex).(Ex). >.(Ex, y).(Ex, y).(Ex). 3 .(Ex, y, z). 
and other tautologies follow from the rules. I write ‘and other 
tautologies” and not “and so on ad inf.”’ since one doesn’t yet have 
to use that concept. 


1When the numbers were written out in the decimal system there 
were rules, namely the addition rules for every pair of numbers 
from o to 9, and, used appropriately, these sufficed for the addition 
of all numbers. Now which rule corresponds to these elementary 


1. In the manuscript this paragraph is preceded by the remark: I can work out 
17 + 28 according to the rules, I don’t need to give 17 + 28 = 45 (a) asa rule. 
So if ina proof there occurs the step from f(17 + 28) to f(45) I don’t need to say 
it took place according to (a); I can cite other rules of the addition table. 
But what is this like in the (((1) + 1) + 1) notation ? Can I say I could work 
out e.g. 2 + 3 in it? And according to which rules? It would go like this: 
{+ b+{(@+)0+p=)+5+)= 
{((@)+)+)4+1)4+1...¢ 


340 


rules ? It is obvious that ina calculation like o we don’t have to keep 
as many rules in mind as in 17 + 28. Indeed we need only one 
general rule. We don’t need any rules like 3 + 2; on the contrary, 
we now seem to be able to deduce, or work out, how many 3 + 2 
makes. 
We are given the sum 2 + 3 = ? and we write 
1, 2,354, 7,6, 7 
eee eee 
That is in fact how children calculate when they ‘“‘count off”. 
(And that calculus must be as good as any other.) 


It is clear incidentally that the problem whether 5 + (4 + 3) = 
(5 + 4) + 3 can be solved in shis way: 


5 4 3

for this construction has precisely the same multiplicity as every 
other proof of that proposition.

If I name each number after its last letter, that is a proof that 
(E+ D)+C=E+(D+Q=L 

This is a good form of proof, because it shows clearly that the 
result is really worked out and because from it you can read off the 
general proof as well. 


It may sound odd, but it is good advice at this point: don’t do 
philosophy here, do mathematics. 


341 


Our calculus doesn’t at all need to be acquainted with the 
construction of a series ‘(E x)’, ‘(E x, y)’, (Ex, y, z)’ ef¢.; we can 
simply introduce two or three such signs without the “‘eéc.”. We 
can then introduce a calculus with a finite series of signs by laying 
down a sequence of certain signs, say the letters of the alphabet, 
and writing: 

(Ea).(Ea). > .(Ea, b) 

(Ea, b).(Ea). >.(Ea, b, c) 
(Ea, b).(Ea, b). >.(Ea, b, c, d) 
etc. up to z. 

The right hand side (the side to the right of “‘3”’) can then be 

found from the left hand side by a calculus like: 
Gb <P od: ie Fo a8 
a b-- - 
--a be 
B) 
abede 
This calculus could be derived from the rules for the construction 
of tautologies as a simplification. - If I presuppose this law for 
constructing a fragment of the series out of two others, I can then 
introduce as a designation of that fragment the expression “sum 
of the two others’’, and thus give the definition: 


and so on up to z. 

If the rules for the calculus B had been explained by examples, we 
could regard those definitions too as particular cases of a general 
rule and then set problems like “abc + ab = 2”. It is now tempting 
to confuse the tautology 

a) (Ea, b).(Ea, b). >.(Ea, b, c, d) 
with the equation 
B) ab + ab = abcd 
But the latter is a replacement rule, the former isn’t a rule but just 
a tautology. The sign “>”? in « in no way corresponds to the “=” 
in B. 

We forget that the sign “3” in « doesn’t say that the two signs 

to the left and right of it yield a tautology. 


342 


On the other hand we might construct a calculus in which the 
equation € + n=» was obtained as a transformation of the equation 
y) (E&).(Ey). > .(E%) = Taut. 
So that las it were get € = € + nif I work out ¢ from the equation 
Y- 


In these discussions, how does the concept of sum make its 
entry ? — There is no mention of summation in the original calculus 
that lays down that the form 

3) (E£).(E 9). > (EX) 
is tautologous where £=xy, y=x and €=xyz.-Later we 
introduce into the calculus a number system (say the system 
a,b,c, d,...z), and finally we define the sum of two numbers as the 
number that solves the equation y. 


If we wrote “(E x).(E x). > .(Ex, y)’” instead of “(E x).(E x).>. 
(E x+x)” it would make no sense; unless the notation already 
went, not 

t) “(E x), etc.”’, “(E x, y) etc.”’, (Ex, y, z), etc.” 
but 

x) “(E.x), ete.”,(Ex+x) etc.”, “(Ex+x-+4), etc.” 

For why should we suddenly write 

“(Ex, y).(Ex).>.(Exy+x)” instead of 
“(Ex, y).(E x). >.(Ex, y, z)”? 

That would just confuse the notation. ~ Then we say: it will greatly 
simplify the writing of the tautologies if we can write in the right 
bracket simply the expressions in the two left brackets. But so far 
that notation hasn’t been explained: I don’t know what (E xy + x) 
means, or that (E xy + x) =(Ex, y, z). 

But if the notation already went “(E x)’, “(E x+x)”, 
“(Ex+x+x)” that would only give a sense to the expression 
“(Ex+x+x+x+4+x) and not to(E(x+x)+(x+x)). 

The notation x is in the same case as t. A quick way of calculating 
whether you get a tautology of the form 6 is to draw connecting 
lines, thus 


343 


This problem is connected with the fact that in an ostensive 
definition I do not state anything about the paradigm (sample); I 
only use it to make a statement. It belongs to the symbolism and is 
not one of the objects to which I apply the symbolism. 
For instance, suppose that “1 foot” were defined as the length of 
a particular rod in my room, so that instead of saying “‘this door is 
6 ft high”’ I would say “this door is six times as high as zhis length” 
(pointing to the unit rod). In that case we couldn’t say things like 
“the proposition ‘there is an object whose length is 1 ft” proves it- 
self, because I couldn’t express the proposition at all if there were 
no object of that length”. (That is, if I introduced the sign “‘this 
length” instead of “‘1 foot”, then the statement that the unit rod 
is 1 foot long would mean “this rod has this length” (where I point 
both times to the same rod).) Similarly one cannot say of a group of 
strokes serving as a paradigm of 3, that it consists of 3 strokes. 
“If the proposition isn’t true, then the proposition doesn’t 
exist” means: “if the proposition doesn’t exist, then it doesn’t 
exist”. And one proposition can never describe the paradigm in 
another, unless it ceases to be a paradigm. If the length of the unit 
rod can be described by assigning it the length “1 foot”, then it 
isn’t the paradigm of the unit of length; if it were, every statement 
of length would have to be made by means of it. 


If we can give any sense at all to a proposition of the form 
“(Jo):(E x). gx” it must be a proposition like: “there is no circle 
on this surface containing only one black speck” (I mean: it must 
have that sort of determined sense, and not remain vague as it did in 
Russellian logic and in my logic in the Tractatus). 

If it follows from the propositions 

e) ~(49):(E x). ox 
and 6) ~(49):(E x, y)- 9X. PY 
that 1 = 2, then here “1” and “2” don’t mean what we commonly 


3.46 


mean by them, because in word-language the propositions p and 6 
would be “there is no function that is satisfied by only one thing”’ 
and “there is no function that is satisfied by only two things.” And | 
according to the rules of our language these are propositions with | 
different senses. 


One is tempted to say: “In order to express ‘(4x, y). px. gy’ we 
need 2 signs ‘x’ and ‘y’.” But that has no meaning. What we need 
for it, is, perhaps, pen and paper; and the proposition means no 


CL. 92 


more than “to express ‘p’ we need ‘p’. 


If we ask: but what then does “‘5 + 7 = 12” mean — what kind of 
significance or point is left for this expression after the elimination 
of the tautologies, etc. from the arithmetical calculus ? — the answer 
is: this equation is a replacement rule which is based on certain 
general replacement rules, the rules of addition. The content of 
5 + 7 = 12 (supposing someone didn’t know it) is precisely what 
children find difficult when they are learning this proposition in 
arithmetic lessons. 


No investigation of concepts, only insight into the number- 
calculus can tell us that 3+ 2=5. That is what makes us rebel 
against the idea that 

“(E 3 x).9x.(E 2x). x.Ind.: >.(E 5 x).ox v yx”! 
could be the proposition 3 + 2= 5. For what enables us to tell 
that this expression is a tautology cannot itself be the result of an ji 
examination of concepts, but must be recognizable from the | 


calculus. For the grammar is a calculus. That is, nothing of what 
the tautology calculus contains apart from the number calculus 
serves to justify it and if it is number we are interested in the rest is 
mere decoration. 


Children learn in school that 2 x 2 = 4, but not that 2 = 2.

Statements of number within mathematics 


What distinguishes a statement of number about a concept from 
one about a variable ? The first is a proposition about the concept, 
the second a grammatical rule concerning the variable. 

But can’t I specify a variable by saying that its values are to be 
all objects satisfying a certain function? In that way I do not 
indeed specify the variable unless I kvow which objects satisfy the 
function, that is, if these objects are given me in another way (say 
by a list); and then giving the function becomes superfluous. If 
we do not know whether an object satisfies the function, then we 
do not know whether it is to be a value of the variable, and the 
grammar of the variable is in that case simply not expressed in this 
respect. 


Statements of number in mathematics (e.g. “The equation 
x? = 1 has 2 roots”) are therefore quite a different kind of thing 
from statements of number outside mathematics (“There are 2 
apples on the table’). 


If we say that A B admits of 2 permutations, it sounds as if we had 
made a general assertion, analogous to “There are 2 men in the 
toom” in which nothing further is said or need be known about 
the men. But this isn’t so in the A B case. I cannot give a more 
general description of A B, B A and so the proposition that no 
permutations are possible cannot say less than that the permutations 
AB, B Aare possible. To say that 6 permutations of 3 elements are 
possible cannot say less, i.e. anything more general, than is shown 
by the schema: 


AAWDWPp Pp

FT cicraneromennvi ST 


For it’s impossible to know the number of possible permutations 
without knowing which they are. And if this weren’t so, the theory 
of combinations wouldn’t be capable of arriving at its general 
formulae. The law which we see in the formulation of the permu- 
tations is represented by the equation p = n! In the same sense, I 
believe, as that in which a circle is given by its equation. — Of 
course I can correlate the number 2 with the permutations A B, 
B A just as I can 6 with the complete set of permutations of A, B, C, 
but that does not give me the theorem of combination theory. — 
What I see in A B; B A is an internal relation which therefore cannot 
be described. That is, what cannot be described is that which 
makes this class of permutations complete. -I can only count 
what is actually there, not possibilities. But I can e.g. work out 
how many rows a man must write if in each row he puts a permu- 
tation of 3 elements and goes on until he cannot go any further 
without repetition. And this means, he needs 6 rows to write 
down the permutations A BC, A CB, etc., since these just are “‘the 
permutations of A, B, C”. But it makes no sense to say that these 
are all permutations of A BC. 


We could imagine a combination computer exactly like the 
Russian abacus. 


It is clear that there is a mathematical question: “How many 
permutations of — say — 4 elements are there ?”’, a question of pre- 
cisely the same kind as “‘What is 25 x 18?”. For in both cases there 
is a general method of solution. 

But still it is only with respect to this method that this question 
exists. 


The proposition that there are 6 permutations of 3 elements is 
identical with the permutation schema and thus there isn’t here a 
proposition “There are 7 permutations of 3 elements’, for no such 
schema corresponds to it. 


349 


You could also conceive the number 6 in this case as another 
kind of number, the permutation-number of A, B, C. Permutation 
as another kind of counting. 


If you want to know what a proposition means, you can always 
ask “How do I know that >”? Do I know that there are 6 permuta- 
tions of 3 elements in the same way in which I know that there are 6 
people in this room? No. Therefore the first proposition is of a 
different 4nd from the second. 


You may also say that the proposition “There are 6 permutations 
of 3 elements” is related to the proposition “There are 6 people in 
this room” in precisely the same way as is “3 + 3 = 6”, which you 
could also cast in the form “There ate 6 units in 3 + 3”. And just 
as in the one case I can count the rows in the permutation schema, 
so in the other I can count the strokes in 


Just as I can prove that 4 x 3 = 12 by means of the schema 
o0 0 0 


° ° 
° ° 
° ° 


oo°o 


I canalso prove 3! = 6 by means of the permutation schema. 
The proposition “the relation R links two objects”, if it is to 


mean the same as “R is a two-place relation’, is a proposition of 
grammar.

Sameness of number and sameness of length 


How should we regard the propositions “these hats are of the 
same size”’, or “‘these rods have the same length” or “these patches 
have the same colour”? Should we write them in the form 
“(AL).La.Lb” ? But if that is intended in the usual way, and so is 
used with the usual rules, it would mean that it made sense to write 
“(AL). La”, i.e. “the patch has a colour’, “the rod has a length”. 
Of course I can write “(4L).La.Lb” for “a and b have the same 
length” provided that I know and bear in mind that ‘“(4L). La” is 
senseless; but then the notation becomes misleading and con- 
fusing (“to have a length”’, “‘to have a father’). - What we have 
here is something that we often express in ordinary language as 
follows: “If a has the length L, so does b”; but here the sentence 
“a has the length L” has no sense, or at least not as a statement 
about a; the proposition should be reworded “if we call the 
length of a ‘L’, then the length of b is L” and ‘L’ here is essentially 
a variable. The proposition incidentally has the form of an example, 
of a proposition that could serve as an example for the general 
sentence; we might go on: “for example, if the length of a is 5 
metres, then the length of b is 5 metres, etc.” — Saying “the rods 
a and b have the same length” says nothing about the length of 
each rod; for it doesn’t even say “that each of the two has a 
length”. So it is quite unlike “A and B have the same father’’ and 
“the name of the father of A and B is ‘N’”’, where I simply sub- 
stitute the proper name for the general description. It is not that 
there is a certain length of which we are at first only told that a and 
b both possess it, and of which ‘5m’ is the name. If the lengths are 
lengths in the visual field we can say the two lengths are the same, 
without in general being able to “name” them with a number. — 
The written form of the proposition “if L is the length of a, the 
length of b too is L” is derived from the form of an example. And 
we might express the general proposition by actually enumerating 


351 


y 
\ 


examples and adding “‘etc.”’. And If I say, ‘a and b are the same 
length; if the length of a is L, then the length of b is L; ifais 5m 
long then b is 5 m long, if a is 7 m long, then b is 7 m long, etc.”’, 
I am repeating the same proposition. The third formulation shows 
that the “and” in the proposition doesn’t stand between two 
forms, as it does in “(4x).ox.yx”, where one can also write 
“(4x). px” and “(4x). bx”. 

Let us take as an example the proposition “there are the same 
number of apples in each of the two boxes”. If we write this 
proposition in the form “there is a number that is the number of 
the apples in each of the boxes” here too we cannot construct the 
form “there is a number that is the number of apples in this 
box” or “the apples in this box have a number”. If I write: 
(Ax) .ox. ~ (4x, y). 9x. py. =.(4n 1X). 9x. = QI, etc. then we might 
write the proposition “the number of apples in both boxes is the 
same’’as “(4n).on.n’’. But “(4n). pn” would not bea proposition. 


If you want to write the proposition “the same number of 
objects fall under » and Y” in a perspicuous notation, the first 
temptation is to write it in the form “gn.yn’’. And that doesn’t 
feel as if it were a logical product of gn and yn, which would 
mean that it made sense to write pn. [5 ; it is essential that the same 
letter should follow as follows 9, and 9n.n is an abstraction 
from the logical products 94.4, 95.5, etc., rather than itself a 
logical product. (So pn doesn’t follow from on.yn. The relation 
of on-dn to a logical product is more like that of a differential 
quotient to a quotient.) It is no more a logical product than the 
photograph of a family group is a group of photographs. Therefore 
the form “on.n” can be misleading and perhaps we should 
prefer a notation of the form “on.dn.”; ot even “(Jn).en.yn”, 
provided that the grammar of this sign is fixed. We can then 
stipulate (4n).en = Taut., which is the same as (4n).on.p. = .p. 


352 


Therefore (3n).envqgn.=.Taut., (Jn).on. Dyn. =. Taut., 
(An). pn|yn. = Cont., etc. 
g1.¥1.(dn).on.dn =.¢1.(4n).on.gn 
p2.$2.(dn).en.dn. = .92.(4n).en.dn 
etc. ad inf. 
And in general the calculation rules for (4n)pn.gyn can be 
derived from the fact that we can write 
(dn).en.dn. = .go.Wo.v. pl. y1.v.92.42.¥. 03.03 
and so on ad inf. 

Itis clear that this is not a logical sum, because “‘and so on ad inf.” 
is not a sentence. The notation (An).gn.yn however is not proof 
against misunderstanding, because you might wonder why you 
shouldn’t be able to put ®n instead of gn.n though if you did 
(dan).®n should of course be meaningless. Of course we can clear 
that up by going back to the notation ~(4x) . ox for po, (Ax)px .~ 
(x,y). ox . ox for 91, etc., i.e. to (4, ox). x for po, (4,1x). px for 
gl respectively, and so on. For then we can distinguish between 

(4,1X).9x(4,1x).~x and (4,1x).x.px 

And if we go back to (Jn). @n.Wn, that means 
(An) :(4,nx).@x.(4,nx).x (which is not nonsensical) and not 
(An) :(4,0x).@x.x, which is nonsensical. 

The expressions ‘‘same number’’, “same length”, “same colour”’, 
etc. have grammars which are similar but not the same. In each 
case it is tempting to regard the proposition as an endless logical 
sum whose terms have the form gn.n. Moreover, each of these 
words has several different meanings, i.e. can itself be replaced by 
several words with different grammars. For “same number’’ does 
not mean the same when applied to lines simultaneously present 
in the visual field as in connection with the apples in two boxes; 
and “same length” applied in visual space is different from ‘“‘same 
length” in Euclidean space; and the meaning of “same colour” 
depends on the criterion we adopt for sameness of colour. 


If we are talking about patches in the visual field seen simul- 
taneously, the expression “same length” varies in meaning 


353 


depending on whether the lines are immediately adjacent or at a 
distance from each other. In word-language we often get out of the 
difficulty by using the expression “it looks”. 


Sameness of number, when it is a matter of a number of lines 
“that one can take in at a glance’’, is a different sameness from that 
which can only be established by counting the lines. 


A B 


Ze) 


fone) 
fo} 


Different criteria for sameness of number: in I and IJ the number 
that one immediately recognizes; in III the criterion of correlation; 
in IV we have to count both groups; in V we recognize the same 
pattern. (Of course these are not the only cases.) 


We want to say that equality of length in Euclidean space 
consists in both lines measuring the same number of cm, both 
5 cm, both 10 cm etc.; but where it is a case of two lines in visual 
space being equally long, there is no length L that both lines have. 


354 


One wants to say: two rods must always have either the same 
length or different lengths. But what does that mean? What it is, 
of course, is a rule about modes of expression. ‘There must either 
be the same number or a different number of apples in the two 
boxes.”” The method whereby I discover whether two lines are of 
the same length is supposed to be the laying of a ruler against each 
line: but do they have the same length when the rulers are not 
applied ? In that case we would say we don’t know whether during 
that time the two lines have the same or different lengths. But we 
might also say that during that time they have no length, or per- 
haps no numerical length. 


Something similar, if not exactly the same, holds of sameness 
between numbers. 


When we cannot immediately see the number of dots in a group, 
we can sometimes keep the group in view as a whole while we 
count, so that it makes sense to say it hasn’t altered during the 
counting. It is different when we have a group of bodies or patches 
that we cannot keep in a single view while we count them, so that 
we don’t have the same criterion for the group’s not changing 
while it is counted. 


Russell’s definition of sameness of number is unsatisfactory for 
various reasons. The truth is that in mathematics we don’t need 
any such definition of sameness of number. He puts the cart before 
the horse. 

What seduces us into accepting the Russellian or Fregean 
explanation is the thought that two classes of objects (apples in 
two boxes) have the same number if they can be correlated 1 to 1. 
We imagine correlation as a check of sameness of number. And 
here we do distinguish in thought between being correlated and 
being connected by a relation; and correlation becomes something 
that is related to connection as the “geometrical straight line”’ is 


355 


related to a real line, namely a kind of ideal connection that is as 
it were sketched in advance by Logic so that reality only has to 
trace it. It is possibility conceived as a shadowy actuality. This in 
turn is connected with the idea of (“‘Jx).px’’ as an expression of 
the possibility of px. 

“o and have the same number” (I will write this ‘‘S(@, Y)” or 
simply “S”’) is supposed to follow from “5.5”; but it doesn’t 
follow from 95.5 that » and ¢ are connected by a 1-1 relation R 
(this I will write “II(, Y)” or “TI’’). We get out of the difficulty by 
saying that in that case there is a relation like 

“x=a.y=b.v.x=c.y=d.v., etc.” 

But if so, then in the first place why don’t we define S without 
more ado as the holding of such a relation? And if you reply that 
this definition wouldn’t include sameness of number in the case of 
infinite numbers, we shall have to say that this only boils down toa 
question of “elegance”’, because for finite numbers in the end I 
have to take refuge in “extensional”’ relations. But these too get us 
nowhere; because saying that between » and y there holds a 
relation e.g. of the form x = a.y = b.v.x=c.y = d says only that 

(4x, y). ox. by. ~ (4x, y,z). ox. py. 92:(4x, y) bx. by. 

~ (Ax, y, 2).4x.dy.dz, 

(Which I write in the form 
(4, 2x). px.(4, 2X). bx.) 

And saying that between 9 and yp there holds one of the relations 
x=a.y=b; x=a.y=b.v.x=c.y=d; etc. etc. means only 
that there obtains one of the facts g1. 1; 92.2 etc. etc. Then we 
retreat into greater generality, saying that between » and ¢ there 
holds some 1-1 relation, forgetting that in order to specify this 
generality we have to make the rule that “some relation” includes 
also relations of the form x = a.y = b, etc. By saying more one does 


356 


not avoid saying the less that is supposed to be contained in the 
more. Logic cannot be duped. 

So in the sense of S in which S follows from 95.5, it is not 
defined by Russell’s definition. Instead, what we need is a series 
of definitions. 

go.S= go.po= to.§ 
gr.S=or.yr=1.S 7} +°°% 
etc. ad inf. 


On the other hand II is used as a criterion of sameness of num- 
ber and of course in another sense of S it can also be equated with S. 
(And then we can only say: if in a given notation S = II, then S 
means the same as II.) 

Though II does not follow from 95.5, 95.5 does from 
Il. 95. 

Tl. gs = Il. 95.5 =I. 
etc. 


We can therefore write: 
II.go=II.go.Yo=II.go0.8 
H.gt=W.gr.yr=Il.91.S B 
Il.g2=Il.p2.~2=II.92.8 
and so on ad inf. 
And we can express this by saying that the sameness of number 
follows from II. And we can also give the rule I1.S = I; it accords 
with the rules, or the rule, 8 and the rule «. 


We could perfectly well drop the rule “S follows from IT’’, that 
is, II.S = IT; the rule 8 does the same job. 

If we write S in the form 

o.Yo.V. or. 1.V¥.02.2.v...ad inf. 
we can easily derive II.S = II by grammatical rules that correspond 
to ordinary language. For 
(go. vo.v.o1.1.v etc.adinf.). I= go. po.I].v.g1.y1 
IL.v. etc. ad inf. = go. I.v.or. .v.o2. I.v.ete. ad inf. 
= II.(go v g1 V 92 Vetc. ad inf.) = II 
The proposition “go v gi V 92 V. etc. ad inf.” must be treated as 
a tautology. 


357 


We can regard the concept of sameness of number in such 
a way that it makes no sense to attribute sameness of 
number or its opposite to two groups of points except in 
the case of two series of which one is correlated 1-1 to at 


least a part of the other. Between such series all we can 
talk about is unilateral or mutual inclusion. 

This has really no more connection with particular numbers 
than equality or inequality of length in the visual field has with 
numerical measurement. We can, but need not, connect it with 
numbers. If we connect it with the number series, then the relation 
of mutual inclusion or equality of length between the rows 
becomes a relation of sameness of number. But then it isn’t only 
that {5 follows from II.5. Wealso have I following from 935.5. 
That means that here S = II.

V MATHEMATICAL PROOF 


22 
In other cases, if I am looking for something, then even before it is found I 
can describe what finding it is; not so, if | am looking for the solution of a 
mathematical problem. 
Mathematical Expeditions and Polar Expeditions 


How can there be conjectures in Mathematics ? Or better, what 
sort of thing is it that looks like a conjecture in mathematics ? 
Such as making a conjecture about the distribution of the primes. 

I might e.g. imagine that someone is writing primes in series 
in front of me without my knowing they are the primes — I might 
for instance believe he is writing numbers just as they occur to 
him — and I now try to detect a law in them. I might now actually 
form an hypothesis about this number sequence, just as I could 
about any sequence yielded by an experiment in physics. 

Now in what sense have I, by so doing, made an hypothesis 
about the distribution of the primes ? 


You might say that an hypothesis in mathematics has the value 
that it trains your thoughts on a particular object -I mean a 
particular region - and we might say “‘we shall surely discover 
something interesting about these things”’. 


The trouble is that our language uses each of the words 
“question”, “‘problem”’, “‘investigation”’, “discovery”’, to refer to 
such basically different things. It’s the same with “‘inference’’, 


22 &¢, 


“proposition”, “proof”. 


The question again arises, what kind of verification do I count 
as valid for my hypothesis? Or can I fante de mieux allow an 
empirical one to hold for the time being until I have a “strict 
proof”? No. Until there is such a proof, there is no connection at all 
between my hypothesis and the “concept”’ of a prime number. 


359 


Only the so-called proof establishes any connection between 
the hypothesis and the primes as such. And that is shown by the 
fact that — as I’ve said — until then the hypothesis can be construed 
as one belonging purely to physics. - On the other hand when we 
have supplied a proof, it doesn’t prove what was conjectured at 
all, since I can’t conjecture to infinity. I can only conjecture what 
can be confirmed, but experience can only confirm a finite number 
of conjectures, and you can’t conjecture the proof until you’ve 
got it, and not then either. 


Suppose that someone, without having proved Pythagoras’ 
theorem, has been led by measuring the sides and hypoteneuses of 
tight angled triangles to “conjecture” it. And suppose he later 
discovered the proof, and said that he had then proved what he had 
earlier conjectured. At least one remarkable question arises: at what 
point of the proof does what he had earlier confirmed by individual 
trials emerge ? For the proof is essentially different from the earlier 
method. — Where do these methods make contact, if the proof and 
the tests are only different aspects of the same thing (the same 
generalisation) if, as alleged, there is some sense in which they give 
the same result ? 

I have said: “from a single source only one stream flows”, and 
one might say that it would be odd if the same thing were to come 
from such different sources. The thought that the same thing can 
come from different sources is familiar from physics, i.e. from 
hypotheses. In that area we are always concluding from symptoms 
to illnesses and we know that the most different symptoms can be 
symptoms of the same thing. 


How could one guess from statistics the very thing the proof 
later showed ? 


How can the proof produce the same generalisation as the 
earlier trials made probable? 


I am assuming that I conjectured the generalisation without 
conjecturing the proof. Does the proof now prove exactly the 
generalisation that I conjectured ?! 


Suppose someone was investigating even numbers to see if they 
confirmed Goldbach’s conjecture. Suppose he expressed the 
conjecture — and it can be expressed — that if he continued with 
this investigation, he would never meet a counterexample as long 
as he lived. If a proof of the theorem is then discovered, will it 
also be a proof of the man’s conjecture ? How is that possible ? 


Nothing is more fatal to philosophical understanding than the 
notion of proof and experience as two different but comparable 
methods of verification. 


What kind of discovery did Sheffer make when he found that 
p vq and ~ p can be expressed by p|q? People had no method of 
looking for p|q, and if someone were to find one today, it wouldn’t 
make any difference. 

What was it we didn’t know before the discovery ? (It wasn’t any- 
thing that we didn’t know, it was something with which we weren’t 
acquainted.) 

You can see this very clearly if you imagine someone objecting 
that p|p isn’t at all the same as is said by ~ p. The reply of course is 
that it’s only a question of the system p|q, etc. having the necessary 
multiplicity. Thus Sheffer found a symbolic system with the 
necessary multiplicity. 

Does it count as looking for something, if I am unaware of 
Sheffer’s system and say I would like to construct a system with 
only one logical constant ? No! 

Systems are certainly not all in one space, so that I could say: 
there are systems with 3 and with 2 logical constants and now Iam 
trying to reduce the number of constants i the same way. There is 
no “same way” here. 


361 


Suppose prizes are offered for the solution — say — of Fermat’s 
problem. Someone might object to me: How can you say that this 
problem doesn’t exist? If prizes are offered for the solution, then 
surely the problem must exist. I would have to say: Certainly, 
but the people who talk about it don’t understand the grammar of 
the expression “mathematical problem” or of the word “solution’’. 
The prize is really offered for the solution of a scientific problem; 
for the exterior of the solution (hence also for instance we talk 
about a Riemannian hypothesis). The conditions of the problem are 
external conditions; and when the problem is solved, what 
happens corresponds to the setting of the problem in the way in 
which solutions correspond to problems in physics. 


If we set as a problem to find a construction for a regular 
pentagon, the way the construction is specified in the setting of 
the problem is by the physical attribute that it is to yield a pentagon 
that is shown by measurement to be regular. For we don’t get the 
concept of constructive division into five (or of a constructive pentagon) 
until we get it from the construction. 


Similarly in Fermat’s theorem we have an empirical structure 
that we interpret as a hypothesis, and not — of course ~ as the product 
of a construction. So in a certain sense what the problem asks for 
is not what the solution gives. 


Of course a proof of the contradictory of Fermat’s theorem (for 
instance) stands in the same relation to the problem as a proof of the 
proposition itself. (Proof of the impossibility of a construction.) 


We can represent the impossibility of the trisection of an angle 
as a physical impossibility, by saying things like “don’t try to 
divide the angle into 3 equal parts, itis hopeless !’’ But in so far as we 
can do that, it is not ¢his that the “proof of impossibility”’ proves. 
That it is hopeless to attempt the trisection is something connected 
with physical facts. 


362 


Imagine someone set himself the following problem. He is to 
discover a game played on a chessboard, in which each player 
is to have 8 pieces; the two white ones which are in the outermost 
files at the beginning of the game (the “‘consuls’’) are to be given 
some special status by the rules so that they have a greater freedom 
of movement than the other pieces; one of the black pieces (the 
“general’’) is to have a special status; a white piece takes a black 
one by being put in its place (and vice versa); the whole game is to 
have a certain analogy with the Punic wars. Those are the con- 
ditions that the game is to satisfy. - There is no doubt that that is a 
problem, a problem not at all like the problem of finding out how 
under certain conditions white can win in chess. — But now imagine 
the problem: “How can white win in 20 moves in the war-game 
whose rules we don’t yet know precisely ?”’ - That problem would 
be quite analogous to the problems of mathematics (other than 
problems of calculation). 


What is hidden must be capable of being found. (Hidden 
contradictions.) 


Also, what is hidden must be completely describable before it is 
found, no less than if it had already been found. 


It makes good sense to say that an object is so well hidden that 
it is impossible to find it; but of course the impossiblity here is not 
a logical one; ie. it makes sense to speak of finding an object to 
describe the finding; we are merely denying that it will happen. 


[We might put it like this: If I am looking for something, — I 
mean, the North Pole, or a house in London —I can completely 
describe what I am looking for before I have found it (or have 
found that it isn’t there) and either way this description will be 
logically acceptable. But when I’m “looking for” something in 
mathematics, unless I am doing so within a system, what I am look- 
ing for cannot be described, or can only apparently be described ; 
for if I could describe it in every particular, I would already 


363 


actually save it; and before it is completely described I can’t be sure 
whether what I am looking for is logically acceptable, and therefore 
describable at all. That is to say, the incomplete description leaves 
out just what is necessary for something to be capable of being 
looked for at all. So it is only an apparent description of what is 
being “looked for.”’]’ 

Here we are easily misled by the legitimacy of an incomplete 
description when we are looking for a real object, and here again 
there is an unclarity about the concepts “description” and “‘object’’. 
If someone says, I am going to the North Pole and I expect to find 
a flag there, that would mean, on Russell’s account, I expect to find 
something (an x) that is a flag — say of such and such a colour and 
size. In that case too it looks as if the expectation (the search) 
concerns only an indirect knowledge and not the object itself; 
as if that is something that I don’t really know (knowledge by 
acquaintance) untill have it in front of me (having previously been 
only indirectly acquainted with it). But that is nonsense. There 
whatever I can perceive — to the extent that it is a fulfilment of my 
expectation — I can also describe in advance. And here “describe” 
means not saying something or other aboutit, but rather expressing 
it. That is, if 1am looking for something I must be ab/e to describe 
it completely. 


The question is: can one say that at present mathematics is as it 
were jagged — or frayed — and for that reason we shall be able to 
round it off? I think you can’t say that, any more than you can say 
that reality is untidy, because there are 4 primary colours, seven 
notes in an octave, three dimensions in visual space, etc. 


You can’t round off mathematics any more than you can say 


“Jet’s round off the four primary colours to eight or ten” or “‘let’s 
round off the eight tones in an octave to ten”.

The comparison between a mathematical expedition and a polar 
expedition. There is a point in drawing this comparison and it is a 
very useful one. 


How strange it would be if a geographical expedition were 
uncertain whether it had a goal, and so whether it had any route 
whatsoever. We can’t imagine such a thing, it’s nonsense. But this 
is precisely what it is like in a mathematical expedition. And so 
perhaps it is a good idea to drop the comparison altogether. 


Could one say that arithmetical or geometrical problems can 
always look, or can falsely be conceived, as if they referred to 


objects in space whereas they refer to space itself? 


By “space” I mean what one can be certain of while searching.

Proof and the truth and falsehood of mathematical propositions 


A mathematical proposition that has been proved has a bias 
towards truth in its grammar. In order to understand the sense of 
25 x 25 = 625 I may ask: how is this proposition proved? But I 
can’t ask how its contradictory is or would be proved, because it 
makes no sense to speak of a proof of the contradictory of 25 x 25 = 
625. So if I want to raise a question which won’t depend on the 
truth of the proposition, I have to speak of checking its truth, not of 
proving or disproving it. The method of checking corresponds to 
what one may call the sense of the mathematical proposition. The 
description of this method is a general one and brings in a system 
of propositions, for instance of propositions of the forma x b= c. 


We can’t say “I will work out shat it is so”, we have to say 
“whether it is so’’, i.e., whether it is so or otherwise. 


The method of checking the truth corresponds to the sense of a 
mathematical proposition. If it’s impossible to speak of such a 
check, then the analogy between “mathematical proposition” and 
the other things we call propositions collapses. Thus there is a 
check for propositions of the form “(dk);,...”? and “~(dk)y...” 
which bring in intervals. 


Now consider the question “does the equation x? + ax + b=0” 
have a solution in the real numbers ?”’. Here again there is a check 
and the check decides between (J...), etc. and ~(4...), ete. 
But can I in the same sense also ask and check ‘“‘whether the equa- 
tion has a solution”? Not unless I include this case too in a 
system with others. 


(In reality the ‘proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra...” 
constructs a new kind of number.) 


366 


Equations are a kind of number. (That is, they can be treated 
similarly to the numbers.) 


A “proposition of mathematics” that is proved by an induction 
is not a “‘proposition” in the same sense as the answer to a mathe- 
matical question unless one can look for the induction in a system 
of checks. 

““Ryery equation G has a root.”’ And suppose it has no root? 
Could we describe that case as we can describe its not having 
arational solution ? What is the criterion for an equation not having 
a solution? For this criterion must be given if the mathematical 
question is to have a sense and if the apparent existence proposition 
is to be a “proposition” in the sense of an answer to a question. 

(What does the description of the contradictory consist of? 
What supports it? What are the examples that support it, and how 
are they related to particular cases of the proved contradictory? 
These questions are not side-issues, but absolutely essential.) 

(The philosophy of mathematics consists in an exact scrutiny of 
mathematical proofs — not in surrounding mathematics with a 
vapour.) 


In discussions of the provability of mathematical propositions 
it is sometimes said that there are substantial propositions of 
mathematics whose truth or falsehood must remain undecided. 
What the people who say that don’t realize is that such propositions, 
if we can use them and want to call them “propositions’’, are not 
at all the same as what are called “propositions” in other cases; 
because a proof alters the grammar of a proposition. You can 
certainly use one and the same piece of wood first as a weathervane 
and then as a signpost; but you can’t use it fixed as a weathervane 
and moving as a signpost. If some one wanted to say “There are 
also moving signposts”’ I would answer ‘“‘You really mean ‘There 
are also moving pieces of wood’. I don’t say that a moving piece of 
wood can’t possibly be used at all, but only that it can’t be used as 
a signpost”’.

The word “proposition”, if it is to have any meaning at all here, 
is equivalent to a calculus: to a calculus in which p v~p is a 
tautology (in which the “‘law of the excluded middle” holds). When 
it is supposed not to hold, we have altered the concept of proposi- 
tion. But that does not mean we have made a discovery (found 
something that is a proposition and yet doesn’t obey such and such 
a law); it means we have made a new stipulation, or set up a new 
game.

If you want to know what is proved, look at the proof 


Mathematicians only go astray, when they want to talk about 
calculi in general; they do so because they forget the particular 
stipulations that are the foundations of each particular calculus. 


The reason why all philosophers of mathematics miss their way 
is that in logic, unlike natural history, one cannot justify generali- 
zations by examples. Each particular case has maximum signifi- 
cance, but once you have it the story is complete, and you can’t 
draw from it any general conclusion (or any conclusion af a//). 


There is no such thing as a logical fiction and hence you can’t 
work with logical fictions; you have to work out each example 


fully. 


In mathematics there can only be mathematical troubles, there 
can’t be philosophical ones. 


The philosopher only marks what the mathematician casually 
throws off about his activities. 


The philosopher easily gets into the position of a ham-fisted 
director, who, instead of doing his own work and merely super- 
vising his employees to see they do their work well, takes over 
their jobs until one day he finds himself overburdened with other 
people’s work while his employees watch and criticize him. He is 
particularly inclined to saddle himself with the work of the 
mathematician. 


If you want to know what the expression “continuity of a func- 
tion’’ means, look at the proof of continuity ; that will show what it 
proves. Don’t look at the result as it is expressed in prose, or in the 
Russellian notation, which is simply a translation of the prose 
expression; but fix your attention on the calculation actually going 


369 


on in the proof. The verbal expression of the allegedly proved 
ptoposition is in most cases misleading, because it conceals the 
real purport of the proof, which can be seen with full clarity in the 
proof itself. 


“Ts the equation satisfied by any numbers ?”’; “It is satisfied by 
numbers”’ ; “It is satisfied by all (no) numbers.”’ Does your calculus 
have proofs ? And what proofs? It is only from them that we will 
be able to gather the sense of these proportions and questions. 


Tell me how you seek and I will tell you what you are seeking. 


We must first ask ourselves: is the mathematical proposition 
proved? If so, how? For the proof is part of the grammar of the 
proposition! — The fact that this is so often not understood arises 
from our thinking once again along the lines of a misleading ana- 
logy. As usual in these cases, it is an analogy from our thinking in 
natural sciences. We say, for example, “this man died two hours 
ago”’ and if someone asks us “how can you tell that ?” we can give 
a series of indications (symptoms). But we also leave open the 
possibility that medicine may discover hitherto unknown methods 
of ascertaining the time of death. That means that we can already 
describe such possible methods; it isn’t their description that is 
discovered. What is ascertained experimentally is whether the 
description corresponds to the facts. For example, I may say: one 
method consists in discovering the quantity of haemoglobin in 
the blood, because this diminishes according to such and such a 
law in proportion to the time after death. Of course that isn’t 
correct, but if it were correct, nothing in my imaginary description 
would change. If you call the medical discovery “the discovery of 
a proof that the man died two hours ago” you must go on to say 
that this discovery does not change anything in the grammar of 
the proposition “the man died two hours ago”. The discovery is 
the discovery that a particular hypothesis is true (or: agrees with 


37° 


the facts). We are so accustomed to these ways of thinking, that 
we take the discovery of a proof in mathematics, sight unseen, as 
being the same or similar. We are wrong to do so because, to put it 
concisely, the mathematical proof couldn’t be described before it is 
discovered. 

The “medical proof” didn’t incorporate the hypothesis it 
proved into any new calculus, so it didn’t give it any new sense; a 
mathematical proof incorporates the mathematical proposition 
into a new calculus, and alters its position in mathematics. The 
proposition with its proof doesn’t belong to the same category as 
the proposition without the proof. (Unproved mathematical 
propositions — signposts for mathematical investigation, stimuli 
to mathematical constructions.) 


Are all the variables in the following equations variables of the 
same kind? 
x+y? + 2xy=(xty)? 
x*+3x+2=0 
x*++ax+b=o 
x4+xy+z=0 ? 


That depends on the use of the equations. — But the distinction 
between no. 1 and no. 2 (as they are ordinarily used) is not a matter 
of the extension of the values satisfying them. How do you prove 
the proposition “No. 1 holds for all values of x and y” and how do 
you prove the proposition “there are values of x that satisfy No. 2°” 
There is no more and no less similarity between the senses of the 
two propositions than there is between the proofs. 


But can’t I say of an equation “I know it doesn’t hold for some 
substitutions — I’ve forgotten now which; but whether it doesn’t 
hold in general, I don’t know ?” But what do you mean when you 
say you know that? How do you know? Behind the words “I 
know...” there isn’t a certain state of mind to be the sense of 
those words. What can you do with that knowledge? That’s what 


371 


fede we ate ela 


will show what the knowledge consists in. Do you know a method 
for ascertaining that the equation doesn’t hold in general? Do you 
remember that the equation doesn’t hold for some values of x 
between o and 1000? Or did someone just show you the equation 
and say he had found values of x that didn’t satisfy the equation, 
so that perhaps you don’t yourself know how to establish it for a 
given value? etc. etc. 


“T have worked out that there is no number that...” - In what 
system of calculation does that calculation occur? — That will 
show us to which proposition-system the worked-out proposition 


belongs. (One also asks: “how does one work out something like 
that >””) 


“T have discovered that there is such a number.” 

“T have worked out that there is no such number.” 

In the first sentence I cannot substitute “no such” for “such a”. 
What if in the second I put “such a” for “‘no such”’? Let’s suppose 
the result of a calculation isn’t the proposition “~(dn)” but “(4n) 
etc.” Does it then make sense to say something like “Cheer up! 
Sooner or later you must come to such a number, if only you try 
long enough” ? That would only make sense if the result of the 
proof had not been “(dn) etc.” but something that sets limits to 
testing, and therefore a quite different result. That is, the contra- 
dictory of what we call an existence theorem, a theorem that tells us 
to look for a number, is not the proposition “(n) etc.” but a propo- 
sition that says in such and such an interval there is no number 
which... What is the contradictory of what is proved ? — For that 
you must look at the proof. We can say that the contradictory of a 
proved proposition is what would have been proved instead of it if 
a particular miscalculation had been made in the proof. If now, for 
instance, the proof that ~(4n) etc is the case is an induction that 
shows that however far I go such a number cannot occur, the 
contradictory of this proof (using this expression for the sake of 
argument) is not an existence proof in our sense. This case isn’t 
like a proof that one or none of the numbers a, b, c, d has the 


372 


property <; and that is the case that one always has before one’s 
mind as a paradigm. In that case I could make a mistake by be- 
lieving that c had the property and after I had seen the error I 
would know that sone of the numbers had the property. But at this 
point the analogy just collapses. 

(This is connected with the fact that I can’t eo ipso use the 
negations of equations in every calculus in which I use equations. 
For 2 x 3 #7 doesn’t mean that the equation 2 x 3 =7 isn’t to 
occur, like the equation 2 x 3 = sine; the negation is an exclusion 
within a predetermined system. I can’t negate a definition as I can 
negate an equation derived by rules.) 

If you say that in an existence proof the interval isn’t essential, 
because another interval might have done as well, of course that 
doesn’t mean that not specifying an interval would have done as 
well. — The relation of a proof of non-existence to a proof of 
existence is not the same as that of a proof of p to a proof of its 
contradictory. 

One should suppose that in a proof of the contradictory of 
“(An)” it must be possible for a negation to creep in which would 
enable “‘~ (dn)” to be proved erroneously. Let’s for once start at 
the other end with the proofs, and suppose we were shown them 
first and then asked: what do these calculations prove? Look at the 
proofs and shen decide what they prove. 


I don’t need to assert that it must be possible to construct the n 
roots of equations of the n-th degree; I merely say that the proposi- 
tion “this equation has n roots” hasn’t the same meaning if ve 
proved it by enumerating the constructed roots as if I’ve proved 
it in a different way. If 1 find a formula for the roots of an equation, 
I’ve constructed a new calculus; I haven’t filled in a gap in an old 
one. 


Hence it is nonsense to say that the proposition isn’t proved until 
such a construction is produced. For when we do that we construct 


373 


something new, and what we now mean by the fundamental 
theorem of algebra is what the present ‘proof’ shows us. 


“Every existence proof must contain a construction of what it 
proves the existence of.” You can only say “I won’t call anything 
an ‘existence proof’ unless it contains such a construction”. The 
mistake lies in pretending to possess a clear concept of existence. 

We think we can prove a something, existence, in such a way 
that we are then convinced of it independently of the proof. (The idea 
of proofs independent of each other - and so presumably inde- 
pendent of what is proved.) Really, existence is what is proved by 
the procedures we call “existence proofs”. When the intuitionists 
and others talk about this they say: ““This state of affairs, existence, 
can be proved only thus and not thus.” And they don’t see that by 
saying that they have simply defined what ¢hey call existence. For 
it isn’t at all like saying “that a man is in the room can only be 
proved by looking inside, not by listening at the door’’. 


We have no concept of existence independent of our concept of 
an existence proof. 


Why do I say that we don’t discover a proposition like the 
fundamental theorem of algebra, and that we merely construct 
it ? - Because in proving it we give it a new sense that it didn’t have 
before. Before the so-called proof there was only a rough pattern 
of that sense in the word-language. 


Suppose someone were to say: chess only had to be discovered, it 
was always there! Or: the pure game of chess was always there; we 


only made the material game alloyed with matter. 


If a calculus in mathematics is altered by discoveries, can’t we 
preserve the old calculus ? (That is, do we have to throw it away ?) 


374 


That is a very interesting way of looking at the matter. After the 
discovery of the North Pole we don’t have two earths, one with 
and one without the North pole. But after the discovery of the 
law of the distribution of the primes, we do have two kinds of 
primes. 


A mathematical question must be no less exact than a mathe- 
matical proposition. You can see the misleading way in which the 
mode of expression of word-language represents the sense of 
mathematical propositions if you call to mind the multiplicity of a 
mathematical proof and consider that the proof belongs to the 
sense of the proved proposition, i.e. determines that sense. It isn’t 
something that brings it about that we believe a particular proposi- 
tion, but something that shows us what we believe — if we can talk 
of believing here at all. In mathematics there ate concept words: 
cardinal number, prime number, etc. That is why it seems to 
make sense straight off if we ask “chow many prime numbers are 
there >” (Human beings believe, if only they hear words...) In 
reality this combination of words is so far nonsense; until it’s 
given a special syntax. Look at the proof “that there are infinitely 
many primes,” and then at the question that it appears to answer. 


- The result of an intricate proof can have a simple verbal expression 


only if the system of expressions to which this expression belongs 
has a multiplicity corresponding to a system of such proofs. 
Confusions in these matters are entirely the result of treating 
mathematics as a kind of natural science. And this is connected 
with the fact that mathematics has detached itself from natural 
science; for, as long as it is done in immediate connection with 
physics, it is clear that i# isn’t a natural science. (Similarly, you can’t 
mistake a broom for part of the furnishing of a room as long as 
you use it to clean the furniture). 


The main danger is surely that the prose expression of the 
result of a mathematical operation may give the illusion of a 
calculus that doesn’t exist, by bearing the outward appearance of 
belonging to a system that isn’t there at all. 


375 


A proof is a proof of a particular proposition if it goes by a rule 
correlating the proposition to the proof. That is, the proposition 
must belong to a system of propositions, and the proof to a system 
of proofs. And every proposition in mathematics must belong to 
a calculus of mathematics. (It cannot sit in solitary glory and refuse 
to mix with other propositions.) 

So even the proposition “every equation of nth degree has n 
roots” isn’t a proposition of mathematics unless it corresponds to 
a system of propositions and its proof corresponds to an appropriate 
system of proofs. For what good reason have I to correlate that 
chain of equations etc. (that we call the proof) to ¢his prose sen- 
tence? Must it not be clear— according to a rule — from the proof 
itself which proposition it is a proof of ? 


Now it is a part of the nature of what we call propositions that they 
must be capable of being negated. And the negation of what is 
proved also must be connected with the proof; we must, that is, 
be able to show in what different, contrasting, conditions it would 
have been the result.

Mathematical problems 
Kinds of problem 
Search 


“Projects” in mathematics 


Where you can ask you can look for an answer, and where you 
cannot look for an answer you cannot ask either. Nor can you find 
an answer. 


Where there is no method of looking for an answer, there the 
question too cannot have any sense. —- Only where there is a method 
of solution is there a question (of course that doesn’t mean: “‘only 
where the solution has been found is there a question’’). That is: 
where we can only expect the solution of the problem from some 
sort of revelation, there isn’t even a question. To a revelation no 
question corresponds. 


The supposition of undecidability presupposes that there is, so 
to speak, an underground connection between the two sides of 
an equation; that though the bridge cannot be built in symbols, it 
does exist, because otherwise the equation would lack sense. — 
But the connection only exists if we have made it by symbols; the 
transition isn’t produced by some dark speculation different in kind 
from what it connects (like a dark passage between two sunlit 
places). 


I cannot use the expression “the equation E yields the solution 
S” unambiguously until I have a method of solution; because 
“yields” refers to a structure that I cannot designate unless I am 
acquainted with it. For that would mean using the word “yields” 
without knowing its grammar. But I might also say: When I use 
the word “yields” in such a way as to bring in a method of solution, 
it doesn’t have the same meaning as when this isn’t the case. Here 
the word “yields” is like the word “win” (or “lose’”) when at 
one time the criterion for “winning” is a particular set of events in 
the game (in that case I must know the rules of the game in order 
to be able to say that someone has won) and at another by “win- 


377 


ning” I mean something that I could express roughly by 
“must pay”’. 

If we employ “yields” in the first meaning, then “the equation 
yield S’? means: if I transform the equation in accordance with 
certain rules, I get S. Just as the equation 25 x 25 = 620 says that 
I get 620 if I apply the rules for multiplication to 25 x 25. But in 
this case these rules must already be given to me before the word 
“yields” has a meaning, and before the question whether the 
equation yields S has a sense. 


It is not enough to say “‘p is provable”; we should say: provable 
according to a particular system. 

And indeed the proposition doesn’t assert that p is provable 
according to the system S, but according to its own system, the 
system that p belongs to. That p belongs to the system S cannot 
be asserted (that has to show itself). - We can’t say, p belongs to 
the system S; we can’t ask, to which system does p belong; we 
cannot search for p’s system. ““T’o understand p” means, to know its 
system. If p appears to cross over frora one system to another, it 
has in fact changed its sense. 


It is impossible to make discoveries of novel rules holding of a 
form already familiar to us (say the sine of an angle). If they are 
new rules, then it is not the old form. 


If I know the rules of elementary trigonometry, I can check the 
proposition sin 2x = 2 sin x.cos x, but not the proposition sin x = 
x—%)+%-—... but that means that the sine function of elementary 
trigonometry and that of higher trigonometry are different 
concepts. 

The two propositions stand as it were on two different planes. 
However far I travel on the first plane I will never come to the 
proposition on the higher plane. 

A schoolboy, equipped with the armoury of elementary trigo- 
nometry and asked to test the equation sin x= x— x. simply 
wouldn’t find what he needs to tackle the problem. He not merely 


couldn’t answer the question, he couldn’t even understand it. 


378 


(It would be like the task the prince set the smith in the fairy tale: 
fetch me a ‘Fiddle-de-dee’. Busch, o/ksmarchen). 


We call ita problem, when weareasked “how many are 25 x 16”, 
but also when we are asked: what is § sin? x dx. We regard the first 
as much easier than the second, but we don’t see that they are 
“problems” in different senses. Of course the distinction is not a 
psychological one; it isn’t a question of whether the pupil can solve 
the problem, but whether the calculus can solve it, or which 
calculus can solve it. 


The distinctions to which I can draw attention are ones that 
are familiar to every schoolboy. Later on we look down on those 
distinctions, as we do on the Russian abacus (and geometrical 
proofs using diagrams); we regard them as inessential, instead of 
seeing them as essential and fundamental. 


Whether a pupil Avows a rule for ensuring a solution to fsin?x.dx is 
of no interest; what does interest us is whether the calculus we 
have before us (and that he happens to be using) contains such a 
rule. 

What interests us is not whether the pupil can do it, but whether 
the calculus can do it, and how it does it. 


In the case of 25 x 16 = 370 the calculus we use prescribes every 
step for the checking of the equation. 


“I succeeded in proving this” is a remarkable expression. (That is 
something no one would say in the case of 25 x 16 = 400). 


One could lay down: “whatever one can tackle is a problem. — 
Only where there can be a problem, can something be asserted.”

Wouldn’t all this lead to the paradox that there are no difficult 
problems in mathematics, since if anything is difficult it isn’t a 
problem? What follows is, that the “difficult mathematical 
problems”, i.e. the problems for mathematical research, aren’t in 
the same relationship to the problem “25 x 25 = 2” as a feat of 
acrobatics is to a simple somersault. They aren’t related, that is, 


just as very easy to very difficult; they are ‘problems’ in different 
meanings of the word. 


“You say ‘where there is a question, there is also a way to 
answer it’, but in mathematics there are questions that we do not 
see any way to answer.” Quite right, and all that follows from 
that is that in this case we are not using the word ‘question’ in 
the same sense as above. And perhaps I should have said “here 
there are two different forms and I want to use the word ‘question’ 
only for the first’. But this latter point is a side-issue. What is 
important is that we are here concerned with two different forms. 
(And if you want to say they are just two different kinds of question 
you do not know your way about the grammar of the word “kind”’.) 


“I know that there is a solution for this problem, although I 
don’t yet know what kind of solution” —- In what symbolism do 
you know it? 


“I know that here there must be a law.””! Is this knowledge an 
amorphous feeling accompanying the utterance of the sentence ?

joins in this wall without interruption, omission or repetition. Cf. Remarks on

That does not interest us. And if it is a symbolic process — well, 
then the problem is to represent it in a visible symbolism. 


What does it mean to be/ieve Goldbach’s theorem? What does 
this belief consist in? In a feeling of certainty as we state or hear 
the theorem? That does not interest us. I don’t even know how 
far this feeling may be caused by the proposition itself. How does 
the belief connect with this proposition ? Let us look and see what 
are the consequences of this belief, where it takes us. “It makes me 
search for a proof of the proposition.” — Very well; and now let us 
look and see what your searching really consists in. Then we shall 
know what belief in the proposition amounts to. 


We may not overlook a difference between forms - as we may 
overlook a difference between suits, if it is very slight. 

For us — that is, in grammar - there are in a certain sense no 
‘fine distinctions’. And altogether the word distinction doesn’t 
mean at all the same as it does when it is a question of a distinction 
between two things. 


A philosopher feels changes in the style of a derivation which a 
contemporary mathematician passes over calmly with a blank face. 
What will distinguish the mathematicians of the future from those 
of today will really be a greater sensitivity, and shat will —as it 
were — prune mathematics; since people will then be more intent 
on absolute clarity than on the discovery of new games. 


Philosophical clarity will have the same effect on the growth of 
mathematics as sunlight has on the growth of potato shoots. (In a 
dark cellar they grow yards long.) 


A mathematician is bound to be horrified by my mathematical 
comments, since he has always been trained to avoid indulging in 


thoughts and doubts of the kind I develop. He has learned to 
regard them as something contemptible and, to use an analogy 
from psycho-analysis (this paragraph is reminiscent of Freud), he 
has acquited a revulsion from them as infantile. That is to say, I 
trot out all the problems that a child learning arithmetic, etc., finds 
difficult, the problems that education represses without solving. 
I say to those repressed doubts: you are quite correct, go on asking, 
demand clarification!

Exler’s proof 


From the inequality 
t+$t+4+ i+... # 
(+44 H+ Rt...) G4+44+8H+...) 
can we derivea number which is still missing from the combinations 
on the right hand side ? Euler’s proof that there are infinitely many 
prime numbers is meant to be an existence proof, but how is such 
a proof possible without a construction ? 


~r+h44+...=(+44+Ht---)-Gt+4+H +...) 
The argument goes like this: The product on the right is a series of 
fractions 1/n in whose denominators all multiples of the form 
2” 3" occur; if there were no numbers besides these, then this series 
would necessarily be the same as the series 1+ 4+4+...andin 
that case the sums also would necessarily be the same. But the left 
hand side is « and the right hand side only a finite number 2/1. 
3/2 = 3, so there are infinitely many fractions missing in the right- 
hand series, that is, there are on the left hand side fractions that do 
not occur on the right.’ And now the question is: is this argument 
correct ? If it were a question of finite series, everything would be 
perspicuous. For then the method of summation would enable us 
to find out which terms occurring in the left hand series were 
missing from the right hand series. Now we might ask: how does it 
come about that the left hand series gives o ? What must it contain 
in addition to the terms on the right to make it infinite ? Indeed the 
question arises: does an equation, like 1+4+4...=3 above 
have any sense at all? I certainly can’t find out from it which are the 
extra terms on the left. How do we know that all the terms on the 
right hand side also occur on the left? In the case of finite series 
I can’t say that until I have ascertained it term by term; — and if I 
do so I see at the same time which are the extra ones. ~ Here there 
is no connection between the result of the sum and the terms, and 
only such a connection could furnish a proof. Everything becomes 
clearest if we imagine the business done with a finite equation: 
1. Here and at one point further down, I have corrected a confusion 


in Wittgenstein’s typescript between “left” and “right” (Tr.). 
g yp P

TEZFE+SE+E HEATH A+ H=1t+h+4+h 

Here again we have that remarkable phenomenon that we might 
call proof by circumstantial evidence in mathematics — something 
that is absolutely never permitted. It might also be called a proof by 
symptoms. The result of the summation is (or is regarded as) a 
symptom that there are terms on the left that are missing on the 
right. The connection between the symptom and what we would 
like to have proved is a /oose connection. That is, no bridge has 
been built, but we rest content with seeing the other bank. 

All the terms on the right hand side occur on the left, but the 
sum on the left hand side is « and the sum of the right hand side is 
only a finite number, so there must... but in mathematics nothing 
must be except what és. 

The bridge has to be built. 

In mathematics there are no symptoms: it is only in a psychologi- 
cal sense that there can be symptoms for mathematicians. 

We might also put it like this: in mathematics nothing can 
be inferred unless it can be seen. 


That reasoning with all its looseness no doubt rests on the 
confusion between a sum and the limiting value of a sum. 

We do see clearly that however far we continue the right-hand 
series we can always continue the left hand one far enough to 
contain all the terms of the right hand one. (And that leaves it open 
whether it then contains other terms as well). 


We might also put the question thus: if you had only this proof, 
what would you bet on it? If we discovered the primes up to N, 
could we later go on for ever looking for a further prime number — 
since the proof guarantees that we will find one? — Surely that is 
nonsense. For “if we only search long enough” has no meaning. 
(That goes for existence proofs in general). 


Could I add further prime numbers to the left hand side in this 


proof? Certainly not, because I don’t know how to discover any, 
and that means that I have no concept of prime number; the proof 


384 


hasn’t given me one. I could only add arbitrary numbers (or series). 


(Mathematics is dressed up in false interpretations). 


(“Such a number Aas ¢o turn up” has no meaning in mathematics. 
That is closely connected with the fact that “in logic nothing is 
mote general or more particular than anything else’’). 


If the numbers were all multiples of 2 and 3 then 


( lim = 3) . ( lim = 3) would have to yield lim = & 
but it does not... What follows from that? (The law excluded 
middle). Nothing follows, except that the limiting values of the 
sums are different; that is, nothing. But now we might investigate 
how this comes about. And in so doing we may hit on numbers that 
ate not representable as 2”-3“. Thus we shall hit on larger prime 
numbers, but we will never see that zo number of such original 
numbers will suffice for the formulation of all numbers. 


rt+4444... 41444448 

However many terms of the form 1/2” I take they never add up to 
more than 2, whereas the first four terms of the left-hand series 
already add up to more than 2. (So ¢his must already contain the 
proof.) This also gives us at the same time the construction of a 
number that is not a power of 2, for the rule now says: find a 
segment of the series that adds up to more than 2: this must 
contain a number that is not a power of 2. 


(Vtt+aet+...).+4+3 Sed oui dees 1. )=n 

If I extend the sum 1+4+4+... until it is greater than n, 
this part must contain a term that doesn’t occur in the right hand

The trisection of an angle, ete. 


We might say: in Euclidean plane geometry we can’t look for 
the trisection of an angle, because there is no such thing, and 
we can’t look for the bisection of an angle, because there is such a 


thing. 


In the world of Euclid’s Elements I can no more ask for the 
trisection of an angle than I can search for it. It just isn’t mentioned. 


(I can locate the problem of the trisection of an angle within a 
larger system but can’t ask within the system of Euclidean geometry 
whether it’s soluble. In what /anguage should I ask this? In the 
Euclidean? — But neither can I ask in Euclidean language about 
the possibility of bisecting an angle within the Euclidean system. 
For in that language that would boil down to a question about 
absolute possibility, which is always nonsense.) 


Incidentally, here we must make a distinction between different 
sorts of question, a distinction which will show once again that 
what we call a “question” in mathematics is not the same as what 
we call by that name in everyday life. We must distinguish between 
the question “chow does one divide an angle into two equal parts ?”’ 
and the question “ is hs construction the bisection of an angle?” 
A question makes sense only in a calculus which gives us a method 
for its solution; and a calculus may well give us a method for 
answering the one question without giving us a method for answer- 
ing the other. For instance, Euclid doesn’t shew us how to look 
for the solutions to his problems; he gives them to us and then 
proves that they are solutions. And this isn’t a psychological or 
pedagogical matter, but a mathematical one. That is, the calculus 


(the one he gives us) doesn’t enable us to look for the construction. 


A calculus which does enable us to do that is a different one. 


387 


(Compare methods of integration with methods of differentiation, 
etc.) 


In mathematics there are very different things that all get called 
proofs, and the differences between them are /ogica/ differences. 
The things called ‘proofs’ have no more internal connection with 
each other than the things called ‘numbers’. 


What kind of proposition is “It is impossible to trisect an angle 
with ruler and compass” ? The same kind, no doubt, as “There is no 
F(3) in the series of angle-divisions F(n), just as there is no 4 in 


n.(n—1) 


the series of combination-numbers > But what kind of 


proposition is shat? The same kind as “there is no 4 in the series 
of cardinal numbers’’. That is obviously a (superfluous) rule of the 
game, something like: in draughts there is no piece that is called 
“the queen”’. The question whether trisection is possible is then the 
question whether there is such a thing in the game as trisection, 
whether there is a piece in draughts called “the queen’”’ that has some 
kind of a role like that of the queen in chess. Of course this question 
could be answered simply by a stipulation; but it wouldn’t set any 
problem or task of calculation, and so it wouldn’t have the same 
sense as a question whose answer was: I will work out whether 
there is such a thing. (Something like: I will work out whether 
any of the numbers 5, 7, 18, 25 is divisible by 3). Now is the 
question about the possibility of trisecting an angle that sort of 
question? It is if you have a general system in the calculus for 
calculating the possibility of division into n equal parts. 

Now why does one call ¢his proof the proof of this proposition? 
A proposition isn’t a name; as a proposition it belongs to a system 
of language. If I can say “there is no such thing as trisection” then 
it makes sense to say “there is no such thing as quadrisection”’, 
etc., etc. And if this is a proof of the first proposition (a part of its 
syntax), then there must be corresponding proofs (or disproofs) 
for the other propositions of the proposition-system, otherwise 
they don’t belong to the same system. 


I can’t ask whether 4 occurs among the combination-numbers 


388 


if that is my number-system. And I can’t ask whether 4 occurs in 
the cardinal numbers, or show that it isn’t one of them, unless by 
“cardinal numbers” I mean part of a system that contains 4 as well. 
(Equally I can’t either say or prove that 3 is one of the cardinal 
numbers.) The question really means something like this: “If you 
divide 1/2 do you get whole numbers ?”’, and that can only be 
asked in a system in which divisibility and indivisibility is familiar. 
(The working out must make sense.) 

If we don’t mean by “cardinal numbers” a subset of the rational 
numbers, then we can’t work out whether 81/3 is a cardinal 
number, but only whether the division 81/3 comes out or not. 


Instead of the problem of trisecting an angle with straightedge 
and compass we might investigate a parallel, and much more 
perspicuous problem. There is nothing to prevent us restricting 
the possibilities of construction with straightedge and compass 
still further. We might for instance lay down the condition that 
the angle of the compass may not be changed. And we might lay 
down that the only construction we know - or better: that our 
calculus knows - is the one used to bisect a line AB, namely 


(That might actually be the primitive geometry of a tribe. I said 
above that the number series “1, 2, 3, 4, 5, many” has equal rights 
with the series of cardinal numbers! and that would go for this 
geometry too. In general it is a good dodge in our investigations 
to imagine the arithmetic or geometry of a primitive people.)

I will call this geometry the system « and ask: “in the system « 
is it possible to trisect a line ?” 

What kind of trisection is meant in this question? — that’s 
obviously what the sense of the question depends on. For instance, 
is what is meant physical trisection — trisection, that is, by trial and 
error and measurement? In that case the answer is perhaps yes. 
Or optical trisection —trisection, that is, which yields three 
parts which look the same length ? It is quite easily imaginable that 
the parts a, b, and c might look the same length if, for instance, we 
were looking through some distorting medium. 


We might represent the results of division in the system « by 
the numbers 2, 27, 23, etc. in accordance with the number of the 
segments produced; and the question whether trisection is 
possible might mean: does any of the numbers in this series = 3 ? Of 
course that question can only be asked if 2, 22, 23, etc. are 
imbedded in another system (say the cardinal number system); it 
can’t be asked if these numbers are themselves our number system 
for in that case we, or our system, are not acquainted with the 
number 3. But if our question is: is one of the numbers 2, 22, etc. 
equal to 3, then here nothing is really said about a frisection of the 
line. None the less, we might look in this manner at the question 
about the possibility of trisection. — We get a different view, if we 
adjoin to the system « a system in which lines are divided in the 
manner of this figure. It can then be asked: is a division into 180 


39° 


sections a division of type «? And this question might again

boil down to: is 108 a power of 2? But it might also indicate a 
different decision procedure (have a different sense) if we connected 
the systems « and 8 to a system of geometrical constructions in 
such a way that it could be proved in the system that the two 
constructions “must yield” the same division points B, C, D. 


Suppose that someone, having divided a line AB into 8 sections 
in the system «, groups these into the lines a, b, c, and asks: is that 
a trisection into 3 equal sections ? (We could make the case more 
easily imaginable if we took a larger number of original sections, 
which would make it possible to form groups of sections which 


A B 


os Sa a 


a b c

looked the same length). The answer to that question would be a 
ptoof that 23 is not divisible by 3 ; or an indication that the sections 
are in the ratio 1:3:4. And now you might ask: but surely I do 
have a concept of trisection in the system, a concept of a division 
which yields the parts a, b, c, in the ratio 1:1:1? Certainly, I have 
now introduced a new concept of ‘trisection of a line’; we might 
well say that by dividing the line AB into eight parts we have 
divided the line CB into 3 equal parts, if that is just 40 mean we have 
produced a line that consists of 3 equal parts. 


A C | | B 

The perplexity in which we found ourselves in relation to the 
problem of trisection was roughly this: if the trisection of an angle 
is impossible - logically impossible -how can we ask questions 
aboutit at all ? How can we describe what is logically impossible and 
significantly raise the question of its possibility ? That is, how can 
one put together /ogical/y ill-assorted concepts (in violation of 
grammar, and therefore nonsensically) and significantly ask about 
the possibility of the combination ? — But the same paradox would 
arise if we asked “is 25 x 25 =620?”; for after all it’s /ogically 
impossible that that equation should be correct; I certainly can’t 
describe what it would be like if ...— Well, a doubt whether 
25 X 25 = 620 (or whether it = 625) has no more and no less sense 
than the method of checking gives it. Itis quite correct that we don’t 
here imagine, or describe, what it is like for 25 x 25 to be 620; what 
that means is that we are dealing with a type of question that is 
(logically) different from “‘is this street 620 or 625 metres long”? ? 


(We talk about a “division of a circle into 7 segments” and also of a 
division of a cake into 7 segments).

Searching and trying 


If you say to someone who has never tried “try to move your 
ears’’, he will first move some part of his body near his ears that he 
has moved before, and either his ears will move at once or they 
won't. You might say of this process: he is trying to move his ears. 
But if it can be called trying, it isn’t trying in at all the same sense as 
trying to move your ears (or your hands) in a case where you 
already “know how to do it” but someone is holding them so that 
you can move them only with difficulty or not at all. It is the first 
sense of trying that corresponds to trying “to solve a mathematical 
problem” when there is no method for its solution. One can always 
ponder on the apparent problem. If someone says to me “try by 
sheer will power to move that jug at the other end of the room” I 
will look at it and perhaps make some strange movements with my 
face muscles; so that even in that case there seems to be sucha thing 


as trying. 


Think of what it means to search for something in one’s memory. 
Here there is certainly something like a search in the strict sense. 


But trying to produce a phenomenon is not the same as searching 
for it. 

Suppose I am feeling for a painful place with my hand. I am 
searching in touch-space not in pain-space. That means: what I 
find, if I find it, is really a place and not the pain. That means that 
even if experience shows that pressing produces a pain, pressing 
isn’t searching for a pain, any more than turning the handle of a 
generator is searching for a spark. 


393 


Can one try to beat the wrong time to a melody ? How does such 
an attempt compare with trying to lift a weight that is too heavy? 


It is highly significant that one can see the group | | | | | in 
different ways (in different groupings); but what is still more note- 
worthy is that one can do it at will. That is, that there is a quite 
definite process of producing a particular “view” at will; and cor- 
respondingly a quite definite process of unsuccessfully attempting 
to do so. Similarly, you can to order see the figure below in such a 
way that first one and then the other vertical line is the nose, and first 
one and then the other line becomes the mouth; in certain citcum- 
stances you can try in vain to do the one or the other. 


The essential thing here is that this attempt is the same kind of 
thing as trying to lift a weight with the hand; is isn’t like the sort of 
trying where one does different things, tries out different means, 
in order (e.g.) to lift a weight. In the two cases the word “attempt” 
has quite different meanings. (An extremely significant grammati- 
cal fact.)

VI INDUCTIVE PROOFS AND PERIODICITY 


a 
How far is a proof by induction a proof of a proposition? 


If a proof by induction is a proof of a+(b+c)=(a+b)+¢, 
we must be able to say: the calculation gives the result that a + (b + c) 
=(a+b)+c(and no other result). 


In that case the general method of calculating it must already be 
known, and we must be able to work out a+ (b + c) straight off in 
the way we can work out 25 x 16. So first there is a general 
rule taught for working out all such problems, and later the 
particular cases are worked out. — But what is the general method 
of working out here? It must be based on general rules for signs 
(- say, the associative law -). 


If I negate a+ (b+ c) =(a+ b) + cit only makes sense if I mean 
to say something like: a +(b + c)isn’t(a + b) +c, but(a + 2b) +c. 
For the question is: In what space do I negate the proposition? 
If I mark it off and exclude it, what do I exclude it from? 

To check 25 x 25 = 625 I work out 25 x 25 until I get the right 
hand side; — can I work out a+(b+c)=(a+b) +c, and get the 
result (a+b)+c? Whether it is provable or not depends on 
whether we treat it as calculable or not. For if the proposition is a 
rule, a paradigm, which every calculation has to follow, then it 
makes no more sense to talk of working out the equation, than to 
talk of working out a definition. 


What makes the calculation possible is the system to which the 
proposition belongs; and that also determines what miscalcula- 
tions can be made in the working out. E.g.(a + b)? is a? + 2ab + b? 
and not a2+ab+b?; but (a+b)? =—4 is not a possible mis- 
calculation in this system. 


I might also say very roughly (see other remarks): “25 x 64 
= 160, 64 x 25 = 160; that proves that a x b=b x a”’ (this way of 
speaking need not be absurd or incorrect; you only have to inter- 
pret it correctly). The conclusion can be correctly drawn from 
that; so in one sense “a.b = b.a” can be proved. 

And I want to say: It is o#/y in the sense in which you can call 
working out such an example a proof of the algebraic proposition 
that the proof by induction is a proof of the proposition. Only to 
that extent is ita check of the algebraic proposition. (It is a check of 
its structure, not its generality). 


(Philosophy does not examine the calculi of mathematics, but 
only what mathematicians say about these calculi.)

Recursive proof and the concept of proposition. Is the proof a proof that 
a proposition is true and its contradictory false? 


Is the recursive proof of 
at+(b+c)=(at+b)+c...A 
an answer to a question? If so, what question? Is it a proof that an 
assertion is true and its contradictory false ? 


What Skolem! calls a recursive proof of A can be written thus; 


a+(b+1)=(a+b)+1 
a+(b+(c+1))=a+((b+ce)+1)=(at+(b+o))+1 B 
(a+b)+(c+1)=((a+b)+e)4+1 


In this proof the proposition proved obviously doesn’t occur at 
all. - What we have to do is to make a general stipulation per- 
mitting the step to it. This stipulation could be expressed thus 


Beer Fla) : 
c+ 1) = F(o(c 2% 
1 wet )=FYO)) #O- #0 


If three equations of the from «, 8, y are proved, we say “the 
equation A is proved for all cardinal numbers’’. This is a definition 
of this latter form of expression in terms of the first. It shows that 
we aten’t using the word “prove” in the second case in the same 
way as in the first. In any case it is misleading to say that we have 
proved the equation A or A. Perhaps it is better to say that we have 
proved its generality, though that too is misleading in other 
respects. 

Now has the proof B answered a question, or proved an asser- 
tion true? And which is the proof B? Is it the group of three 
equations of the form «, 8, y or the class of proofs of these equa- 
tions? These equations do assert something (they don’t prove 
anything in the sense in which /hey are proved). But the proofs

Vid.-Selsk i Kristiana 1923. I Mat.-nat. K. No. 6. p. ; Translated in van

397 


of a, 8, y answer the question whether these three equations are 
correct and prove true the assertion that they are correct. All I can 
do is to explain: the question whether A holds for all cardinal 
numbers is to mean: “for the functions 


e(E) =a+(b+&), VE)=@+by+é 


are the equations «, 8, y valid ?”’ And then that question is answered 
by the recursive proof of A, if what that means is the proofs of 
a, 8, y (or the laying down of « and the use of it to prove B and y). 
So I can say that the recursive proof shows that the equation 
A satisfies a certain condition; but it isn’t the kind of condition that 
the equation (a + b)? = a? + 2b + b? has to fulfil in order to be 
called “‘correct’’. If I call A “correct”? because equations of the 
form «, B, y can be proved for it, I am no longer using the word 
“correct” in the same way as in the case of the equations «, 8, y 
or (a+b)? =a? + 2ab + b?. 
What does “1/3 = 0-3”? mean? Does it mean the same as “1/3 
I 
= 03”? —Or is that division the proof of the first proposition ? 
That is, does it have the same relationship to it as a calculation has 
to what is proved ? 
“1/3 = 0°3” is not the same kind of thing as 
“tfz= 05”; 
what ‘1/2 = 0-5” corresponds to is “1/3 = 0-3” not

Instead of the notation “1/4= 0-25” I will adopt for this 
occasion the following “‘1/4 = 0-25” So, for example, 3/8 = 0-375. 
) S) 
Then I can say, what corresponds to this proposition is not 


1. The dash underneath emphasizes that the remainder is equal to the divi- 
dend. So the expression becomes the symbol for periodic division. (Ed.) 


398 


1/3 =0°3, but e.g. “1/3 = 0-333” .o-3 is not a result of division 
I 

(quotient) in the same sense as 0-375. For we were acquainted with 
the numeral “‘o-375”’ before the division 3/8; but what does 
“9-3”? mean when detached from the periodic division? — The 
assertion that the division a:b giveso.éas quotient is the same as 
the assertion that the first place of the quotient is c and the first 
remainder is the same as the dividend. 

The relation of B to the assertion that A holds for all cardinal 
numbers is the same as that of 1/3 = 0-3 to 1/3 = 0%3 

I 


The contradictory of the assertion “A holds for all cardinal 
numbers” is: one of the equations «, 8, y is false. And the corres- 
ponding question isn’t asking for a decision between a (x). fx and 
a (d4x).~f. 


The construction of the induction is not 2 proof, but a certain 
atrangement of proofs (a pattern in the sense of an ornament). And 
one can’t exactly say either: if I prove three equations, then I 
prove one. Just as the movements of a suite don’t amount to a 
single movement. 


We can also say: we have a rule for constructing, in a certain 
game, decimal fractions consisting only of 3’s; but if you regard 
this rule as a kind of number, it can’t be the result of a division; 
the only result would be what we may call periodic division which 
has the form a/d = c.

Induction. (x).¢x and (Ax).ox. Does the induction prove the generat 
proposition true and an existential proposition false? 


3X2=54+1 
3x(at1)=3+(3 xa)=(5+b)+3=5+(b+3) 

Why do you call this induction the proof that (n):in>2.>. 
3 x n #5?! Well, don’t you see that if the proposition holds for 
n= 2, it also holds for n= 3, and then also for n= 4, and thatit 
goes on like that for ever? (What am I explaining when I explain 
the way a proof by induction works?) So you call it a proof of 
“f(2).£(3).£(4), etc.” but isn’t it rather the form of the proofs of 
“f(2)” and “f(3)”? and “‘f(4)”, etc.? Or does that come ¢o the same 
thing? Well, if I call the induction the proof of ove proposition, I 
can do so only if that is supposed to mean no more than that it 
proves every proposition of a certain form. (And my expression 
relies on the analogy with the relationship between the propo- 
sition “all acids turn litmus paper red” and the proposition 
“sulphuric acid turns litmus paper red’’). 

Suppose someone says “let us check whether f(n) holds for all 
n’” and begins to write the series 

3X2=54+1 
XG H = GX) >see r+ 3H 5 Hts) 

3X (2+ 2)=(3 x (2 +1) +3=(5 +1 +3))+3=5+( 43) +3) 
and then he breaks off and says “I see it holds for all n’”’ — So he has 
seen an induction! But was he /ooking for an induction? He didn’t 
have any method for looking for one. And if he hadn’t discovered 
one, would he ipso facto have found a number which does not 
satisfy the condition? — The rule for checking can’t be: let’s see 
whether there is an induction or a case for which the law does not 
hold. - If the law of excluded middle doesn’t hold, that can only 
mean that our expression isn’t comparable to a proposition. 

When we say that the induction proves the general proposition, 
we think: it proves that this proposition and not its contradictory 


400 


is true. But what would be the contradictory of the proposition 
proved? Well, that (dn). ~ fn is the case. Here we combine two 
concepts: one derived from my current concept of the proof of 
(n).fn, and another taken from the analogy with (4x). ox. (Of 
course we have to remember that “(n).fn” isn’t a proposition until 
Thave a criterion for its truth; and then it only has the sense that the 
criterion gives it. Although, before getting the criterion, I could 
look out for something like an analogy to (x).fx!). What is the 
opposite of what the induction proves? The proof of (a +b)? 
=a? + 2ab + b? works out this equation in contrast to something 
like (a + b)? = a? + 3ab + b?. What does the inductive proof work 
out? The equations: 3x 2=5+1, 3x(at1)=(3 xa)+3, 
(5 +b)+ 3=5+(b+ 3) as opposed to things like 3 x 2=5 +6, 
3 x (a+1)=(4 x a) + 2, etc. But this opposite does not correspond 
to the proposition (4x). 9x — Further, what does conflict with the in- 
duction is every proposition of the form ~ f(n), i.e. the propo- 
sitions “~ f(z)’, “~£(3)”, etc.; that is to say, the induction is she 
common element in the working out of f(z), £(3), etc.; but it isn’t the 
working out of “all propositions of the form f(n)’’, since of course 
no class of propositions occurs in the proof that I call “all propo- 
sitions of the form f(n)’’. Each one of these calculations is a checking 
of a proposition of the form f(n). I was able to investigate the 
correctness of this proposition and employ a method to check it; 
all the induction did was to bring this into a simple form. But if I 
call the induction “the proof of a general proposition”, I can’t ask 
whether that proposition is correct (any more than whether the 
form of the cardinal numbers is correct). Because the things I call 
inductive proofs give me no method of checking whether the general 
proposition is correct or incorrect; instead, the method has to 
show me how to work out (check) whether or not an induction 
can be constructed for a particular case within a system of propo- 
sitions. (If I may so put it, what is checked in this way is whether 
all n have this or that property; not whether all of them have it, or 
whether there are some that don’t have it. For example, we work 


I. ? (x).ox. (Ed.) 


401 


out that the equation x? + 3x +1=0 has no rational roots (that 
there is no rational number that...), and the equation x? + 2x 
+ 1/2 =o has none, but the equation x? + 2x + 1 = 0 does, etc.) 


Hence we find it odd if we are told that the induction is a proof of 
the general proposition; for we feel rightly that in the language of 
the induction we couldn’t have posed the general question at all. 
It wasn’t that we began with an alternative between which we 
had to decide. (We only seemed to, so long as we had in mind a 
calculus with finite classes). 

Prior to the proof asking about the general proposition made no 
sense at all, and so wasn’t even a question, because the question 
would only have made sense if a general method of decision had 
been known before the particular proof was discovered. 

The proof by induction isn’t something that settles a disputed 
question. 


If you say: “the proposition ‘(n).fn’ follows from the induction”’ 
only means that every proposition of the form f(n) follows from 
the induction and “the proposition (Jn). ~ fn contradicts the 
induction” only means “every proposition of the form ~ f(n) is 
disproved by the induction”, then we may agree; but we shall ask: 
what is the correct way for us to use the expression “the propo- 
sition (n).f(n)’?? What is its grammar? (For from the fact that I 
use it in certain contexts it doesn’t follow that I use it everywhere 
in the same way as the expression “‘the proposition (x). px.’’) 


Suppose that people argued whether the quotient of the div- 
ision 1/3 must contain only threes, but had no method of deciding 


it. Suppose one of them noticed the inductive property of 1.0/3 
I 


= 0.3 and said: now I know that there must be only threes in the 
quotient. The others had not thought of shat kind of decision. I 
suppose that they had vaguely imagined some kind of decision by 
checking each step, though of course they could never have 
reached a decision in this way. If they hold on to their extensional 


402 


viewpoint, the induction does produce a decision because in the 

case of each extension of the quotient it shows that it consists of 

nothing but threes. But if they drop their extensional viewpoint 

the induction decides nothing, or nothing that is not decided by 

working out 1.0/3 = 0-3, namely that the remainder is the same 
I 


as the dividend. But nothing else. Certainly, there is a valid ques- 
tion that may arise, namely, is the remainder left after this division 
the same as the dividend ? This question now takes the place of the 
old extensional question, and of course I can keep the old wording, 
but it is now extremely misleading since it always makes it look as 
if having the induction were only a vehicle —a vehicle that can 
take us into infinity. (This is also connected with the fact that the 
sign “‘etc.”’ refers to an internal property of the bit of the series 
that precedes it, and not to its extension.) 


Of course the question “is there a rational number that is a root 
of x? x 3x +1=0°?” is decided by an induction; but in this case 
I have actually constructed a method of forming inductions; and 
the question is only so phrased because it is a matter of constructing 
inductions. That is, a question is settled by an induction, if I can 
look for the induction in advance; if everything in its sign is 
settled in advance bar my acceptance or rejection of it in such a way 
that I can decide yes or no by calculating; as I can decide, for in- 
stance, whether in 5/7 the remainder is equal to the dividend or not. 
(The employment in these cases of the expressions “all...” and 
“there is. ..’’ has a certain similarity with the employment of the 
word “infinite” in the sentence “today I bought a straightedge 
with an infinite radius of curvature’’). 


The periodicity of 1/3 = 0-3 decides nothing that had been left 


I 


open. Suppose someone had been looking in vain, before the 
discovery of the periodicity, for a 4 in the development of 1/3, he 


403 


still couldn’t significantly have put the question “‘is there a 4 in the 
development of 1/3?”. That is, independently of the fact that he 
didn’t actually discover any 4s, we can convince him that he 
doesn’t have a method of deciding his question. Or we might say: 
quite apart from the result of his activity we could instruct him 
about the grammar of his question and the nature of his search (as 
we might instruct a contemporary mathematician about analogous 
problems). “But as a result of discovering the periodicity he does 
stop looking for a 4! So it does convince him that he will never 
find one.” — No. The discovery of the periodicity will cure him of 
looking if he makes the appropriate adjustment. We might ask 
him: “Well, how about it, do you still want to look for a 4?” (Or 
has the periodicity so to say, changed your mind ?) 

The discovery of the periodicity is really the construction of a 
new symbol and a new calculus. For it is misleading to say that it 
consists in our having realised that the first remainder is the same as 
the dividend. For if we had asked someone unacquainted with 
periodic division whether the first remainder in this division was 
the same as the dividend, of course he would have answered “yes”’; 
and so he did realise. But that doesn’t mean he must have realised 
the periodicity; that is, it wouldn’t mean he had discovered the 
calculus with the sign a/b = c.

Isn’t what I am saying what Kant meant, by saying that 5 + 7 
= 12 is not analytic but synthetic a priori? 


404 


32 
Is there a further step from writing the recursive proof to the generaliza- 
tion? Doesn't the recursion schema already say all that is to be said? 


We commonly say that the recursive proofs show that the alge- 
braic equations hold for all cardinal numbers; for the time being 
it doesn’t matter whether this expression is well or ill chosen, the 
point is whether it has the same clearly defined meaning in all 
cases. 


And isn’t it clear that the recursive proofs in fact show the same 
for all “proved” equations ? 


And doesn’t that mean that between the recursive proof and 
the proposition it proves there is always the same (internal) 
relation? 


Anyway it is quite clear that there must be a recursive, or better, 
iterative “proof” of this kind (A proof conveying the insight that 
“that’s the way it must be with all the numbers”’.) 

I.e. it seems clear ¢o me; and it seems that by a process of iteration 
I could make the correctness of these theorems for the cardinal 
numbers intelligible to someone else. 


But how do I know that 28+(45 +17) =(28+45)+17 
without having proved it? How can a general proof give me a 
particular proof? I might after all go through the particular proof, 
and how would the two proofs meet in it? What happens if they 
do not agree? 


In other words: suppose I wanted to show someone that the 
associative law is really part of the nature of number, and isn’t 
something that only accidentally holds in this particular case; 
wouldn’t I use a process of iteration to try to show that the law 
holds and must go on holding ? Well — that shows us what we mean 
here by saying that a law must hold for all numbers. 


405 


And what is to prevent us calling this process a proof of the 
law? 


This concept of ‘‘making something comprehensible”’ is a boon 
in a case like this. 

For we might say: the criterion of whether something is a 
proof of a proposition is whether it could be used for making it 
comprehensible. (Of course here again all that is involved is an 
extension of our grammatical investigation of the word “proof” 
and not any psychological interest in the process of making things 
comprehensible.) 


“This proposition is proved for all numbers by the recursive 
procedure.” That is the expression that is so very misleading. It 
sounds as if here a proposition saying that such and such holds for 
all cardinal numbers is proved true by a particular route, and as if 
this route was a route through a space of conceivable routes. 

But really the recursion shows nothing but itself, just as perio- 
dicity too shows nothing but itself. 


We are not saying that when f(1) holds and when f(c+ 1) 
follows from f(c), the proposition f(x) is therefore true of all 
cardinal numbers; but: “the proposition f(x) holds for all cardinal 
numbers” means “it holds for x=1, and f(c+1) follows from 
f(c)”. 

Here the connection with generality in finite domains is quite 
clear, for in a finite domain that would certainly be a proof that 
f(x) holds for all values of x, and shat is the reason why we say in the 
arithmetical case that f(x) holds for all numbers. 


At least I have to say that any objection that holds against the 
proof B! holds also e.g. against the formula (a + b)* = etc. 


Here too, I would have to say, am merely assuming an algebraic 
rule that agrees with the inductions of arithmetic. 


1. Above, p. 397. 


406 


f(n) x (a+ b) =f(n 4+ 1) 
f(1)=a+b 
therefore f(1) x (a+ b) =(a +b)? = f(2) 
therefore f(z) x (a+ b) =(a + b)? = f(3), etc. 


So far all is clear. But then: “therefore (a +b)" =f(n)”! 


Is a further inference drawn here? Is there still something to be 
established ? 


But if someone shows me the formula (a + b)" = f(n) I could ask: 
how have we got there? And the answer would be the group 


f(n) x (a + b) = f(n + 1) 
f(x1)=a+b 


So isn’t it a proof of the algebraic proposition ? — Or is it rather an 
answer to the question “what does the algebraic proposition 
mean??? 


I want to say: once you’ve got the induction, it’s all over. 


The proposition that A holds for all cardinal numbers is really 
the complex B plus its proof, the proof of 8 and y. But that shows 
that this proposition is not a proposition in the same sense as an 
equation, and this proof is not in the same sense a proof of a 
proposition. 

Don’t forget that it isn’t that we first of all have the concept of 
proposition, and then come to know that equations are mathe- 
matical propositions, and later realise that there are also other kinds 
of mathematical propositions. 


407

How far does a recursive proof deserve the name of “proof”? How far is 


a step in accordance with the paradigm A justified by the proof of B? 


(Editor’s note: What follows between the square brackets we have taken 
from one of the manuscript books that Wittgenstein used for this chapter; 
although it is not in the typescript—“‘A”’ and “B”’ are given above, on p. 397.)

(A step by step investigation of this proof would be very 
instructive.) The first step inI,a +(b+(c+1))=a+((b+0)+1), 
if it is made in accordance with R, shows that the variables in R 
afte not meant in the same way as those in the equations of I; since 
R would otherwise allow only the replacement of a + (b + 1) by 
(a +b) + 1, and not the replacement of b + (c+ 1) by(b+¢)+1.!

The same appears in the other steps in the proof. 

If I said that the proof of the two lines of the proof justifies me 
in inferring the rule a+ (b+) =(a+b)+c, that wouldn’t mean 
anything, unless I had deduced that in accordance with a pre- 
viously established rule. But this rule could only be 


F(t) = FA(1), Fie + 1) = f{F.@)} 
F,(x + 1) = f{F,(x)} F(x) = F(x)... (@)- 


But this rule is vague in respect of F,, F, and f.] 
We cannot appoint a calculation to be a proof of a proposition. 


I would like to say: Do we have ¢o call the recursive calculation 
the proof of proposition I? That is, won’t another relationship do ? 


(What is infinitely difficult is to “see all round” the calculus.) 


In the one case ““The step is justified’? means that it can be 
carried out in accordance with definite forms that have been given. 
In the other case the justification might be that the step is taken in 
accordance with paradigms that themselves satisfy a certain 
condition. 


Suppose that fora certain board game rules are given containing 
only words with no “tr” in them, and that I call a rule justified, if it 
contains no “r’’, Suppose someone then said, he had laid down only 
one tule for a certain game, namely, that its moves must obey rules 
containing no “r”’s, Is that a rule of the game (in the first sense) ? 
Isn’t the game played in accordance with the class of rules all of 


which have only to satisfy the first rule? 


Someone shows me the construction of B and then says that A 
has been proved. I ask “How? All I see is that you have used a[p] 
to build a construction around A”. Then he says “But when that is 


409 


possible, I say that A is proved”. To that I answer: “That only 


> 99 


shows me the new sense you attach to the word ‘prove’. 


In one sense it means that you have used «[e] to construct the 
paradigm in such and such a way, in another, it means as before 
that an equation is in accordance with the paradigm. 


If we ask “‘is that a proof or not?” we are keeping to the word- 
language. 


Of course there can be no objection if someone says: if the terms 
of a step in a construction are of such and such a kind, I say that 
the legitimacy of the step is proved. 


What is it in me that resists the idea of B as a proof of A? In the 
first place I observe that in my calculation I now here use the 
proposition about “all cardinal numbers”. I used 9 to construct the 
complex B and then I took the step to the equation A; in all that 
there was no mention of “all cardinal numbers”. (This proposition 
is a bit of word-language accompanying the calculation, and can 
only mislead me.) But it isn’t only that this general proposition 
completely drops out, it is that no other takes it place. 


So the proposition asserting the generalisation drops out; 
“nothing is proved”’, “nothing follows”. 

“But the equation A follows, it is that that takes the place of the 
general proposition.” Well, to what extent does it follow? Ob- 
viously, I’m here using “follows” in a sense quite different from 
the normal one, because what A follows from isn’t a proposition. 
And that is why we feel that the word “follows” isn’t being 
correctly applied. 


If you say “it follows from the complex B that a+(b+c)= 


(a+b)+c”, we feel giddy. We feel that somehow or other you’ve 
said something nonsensical although outwardly it sounds correct. 


410 


That an equation follows, already has a meaning (has its own 
definite grammar). 


If I am told “A follows from B”’, I want to ask: “what follows ?” 
That a+(b +c) is equal to (a+b) +c, is something postulated, 
if it doesn’t follow in the normal way from an equation. 


We can’t fit our concept of following from to A and B; it 
doesn’t fit. 


“I will prove to you that a+(b+n)=(a+b)+n.” No one 
then expects to see the complex B. You expect to hear another rule 
for a, b, and n permitting the passage from one side to the other. 
If instead of that I am given B with the schema p! I can’t call it a 
ptoof, because I mean something else by “proof”. 

I shall very likely say something like “oh, so that’s what you 
call a ‘proof’, I had imagined . . .” 


The proof of 17+(18+5)=(17+18)+ 5 is certainly carried 
out in accordance with the schema B, and this numerical propo- 
sition is of the form A. Or again: B is a proof of the numerical 
proposition: but for that very reason, it isn’t a proof of A. 


“I will derive Aj, Ay, Ayy from a single proposition.”? ~ This 


1. “The schema 9” — or: the group of equations «, 8 and yon p. 397. A little 
further on Wittgenstein refers to the same group as “R”, p. 414 below. Later 
on p. 433, he speaks again of “the rule R” as here on p. 408, where it is: 
a+(b+1)=(a+ b) + 1. (Ed.) 

2. This, probably, refers to those equations on p. 408 to the right of the 
brackets, that is: a+(b+c)=(at+b)+c,a+1=1+a,a+b=b+a. By, 
By, By . . . will then be the complexes of equations left of the brackets. On the 
meaning of the brackets, see below (Ed.) 


411 


of course makes one think of a derivation that makes use of these 
propositions — We think we shall be given smaller links of some 
kind to replace all these large ones in the chain. 

Here we have a definite picture; and we are offered something 
quite different. 

The inductive proof puts the equation together as it were 
ctossways instead of lengthways. 


If we work out the derivation, we finally come to the point at 
which the construction of B is completed. But at this point we say 
“therefore this equation holds”! But these words now don’t mean 
the same as they do when we elsewhere deduce an equation from 
equations. The words “The equation follows from it” already have 
a meaning. And although an equation is constructed here, it is by 
a different principle. 


If I say “the equation follows from the complex”, then here an 
equation is ‘following’ from something that is not an equation. 


We can’t say: if the equation follows from B, then it does follow 
from a proposition, namely from «.8.y; for what matters is Low 
I get A from that proposition; whether I do so in accordance with 
a tule of inference; and what the relationship is between the 
equation and the proposition «.8.y. (The rule leading to A in this 
case makes a kind of cross-section through «.8.y; it doesn’t view 
the proposition in the same way as a tule of inference does.) 


If we have been promised a derivation of A from «and now see 
the step from B to A, we feel like saying “‘oh, that isn’t what was 
meant”. It is as if someone had promised to give me something and 
then says: see, I’m giving you my trust. 


The fact that the step from B to A is not an inference indicates 
also what I meant when I said that the logical product «.8.y does 
not express the generalization. 


412 


I say that A,, A,, etc. are used in proving (a + b)? = etc. because 
the steps from (a+ b)? toa? + 2ab + b? are all of the form A, or A,,, 
etc. In this sense the step in III from (b+ 1) +a to(b+a)+1 is 
also made in accordance with A,, but the step froma+nton+a 
isn’t! 


The fact that we say “the correctness of the equation is proved” 
shows that not every construction of the equation is a proof. 


Someone shows me the complexes B and I say “they are not 
proofs of the equations A’’. Then he says: “‘You still haven’t seen 
the system on which the complexes are constructed”’, and points it 
out to me. How could that make the Bs into proofs? 


This insight makes me ascend to another, a higher, level; 
whereas a proof would have to be carried out on the lower level. 


Nothing except a definite transition to an equation from other 
equations is a proof of that equation. Here there is no such thing, 
and nothing else can do anything to make B into a proof of A. 


But can’t I say that if I have proved this about A, I have there- 
by proved A? Wherever did I get the illusion that by doing this I 
had proved it ? There must surely be some deep reason for this. 


Well, if it is an illusion, at all events it arose from our expression 
in word-language “this proposition holds for a// numbers’; for 
on this view the algebraic proposition is only another way of 
writing the proposition of word-language. And that form of 
expression caused us to confuse the case of a// the numbers with 
the case of ‘all the people in this room’. (What we do to distin- 
guish the cases is to ask: how does one verify the one and the other ?) 


413 


If I suppose the functions ¢, , F exactly defined and then write 
the schema for the inductive proof: 


R 
% (1) = (1) A 
BB op(c+N=FeO}}.-- n= yn 
y ¥e+D=FYO} 


Even then I can’t say that the step from gr to r is taken on the 
basis of ¢ (if the step in «, 8, ~ was made in accordance with p ~ in 
particular cases 9 = «). It is still the equation A it is made in 
accordance with, and I can only say that it corresponds to the 
complex B if I regard that as another sign in place of the equation 
A. 


For of course the schema for the step had to include «, 8 and y. 


In fact R isn’t the schema for the inductive proof By; that is 
much more complicated, since it has to include the schema B,. 


The only time it is inadvisable to call something a ‘proof? is 
when the ordinary grammar of the word ‘proof’ doesn’t accord 
with the grammar of the object under consideration. 


What causes the profound uneasiness is in the last analysis a 
tiny but obvious feature of the traditional expression. 


What does it mean, that R justifies a step of the form A? No 
doubt it means that I have decided to allow in my calculus only 
steps in accordance with a schema B in which the propositions 
a, 8, y are derivable in accordance with p. (And of course that 
would only mean that I allowed only the steps A,, A,, etc., and 
that those had schemata B corresponding to them). 

It would be better to write “and those schemata had the form 
R corresponding to them”. The sentence added in brackets was 
intended to say that the appearance of generality -I mean the 
generality of the concept of the inductive method — is unnecessary, 


414 


for in the end it only amounts to the fact that the particular con- 
structions B,, B,,, etc. are constructed flanking the equations A,, 
A,,, etc. Or that in that case itis superfluous to pick out the common 
feature of the constructions; all that is relevant are the construc- 
tions themselves, for there is nothing there except these proofs, 
and the concept under which the proofs fall is superfluous, 
because we never made any use of it. Just as if I only want to say — 
pointing to three objects — “put that and that and that in my room”, 
the concept chair is superfluous even though the three objects are 
chairs. (And if they aren’t suitable furniture for sitting on, that 
won’t be changed by someone’s drawing attention to a similarity 
between them.) But that only means, that the individual proof 
needs our acceptance of it as such (if ‘proof’ is to mean what it 
means); and if it doesn’t have it no discovery of an analogy with 
other such constructions can give it to it. The reason why it looks 
like a proof is that «, 8, y and A are equations, and that a general 
tule can be given, according to which we can construct (and in that 
sense derive) A from B. 

After the event we may become awate of this general rule. (But 
does that make us aware that the Bs are really proofs of A?) What 
we become aware of is a rule we might have started with and 
which in conjunction with « would have enabled us to construct 
A,, A,;, etc. But no one would have called it a proof in this game. 


Whence this conflict: “That isn’t a proof!” “That surely is a 
proof.” ? 


We might say that it is doubtless true, that in proving B by « 
Tuse « to trace the contours of the equation A, but not in the way I 
call “proving A by «”. 


The difficulty that needs to be overcome in these discussions is 
the difficulty of looking at the proof by induction as something 
new, naively as it were. 


415 


So when we said above we could begin with R, this beginning 
with R is in a way a piece of humbug. It isn’t like beginning a 
calculation by working out 526 x 718. For in the latter case setting 
out the problem is the first step on the journey to the solution. 
But in the former case I immediately drop the R and have to begin 
again somewhere else. And when it turns out that I construct a 
complex of the form R, it is again immaterial whether I explicitly 


set it out earlier, since setting it out hasn’t helped me at all 
mathematically, i.e. in the calculus. So what is left is just the fact 
that I now have a complex of the form R in front of me. 


We might imagine we were acquainted only with the proof B, 
and could then say: all we have is this construction ~ no mention 
of an analogy between this and other constructions, or of a general 
principle in carrying out the constructions. — If I then see B and A 
like this I’m bound to ask: but why do you call that a proof of A 
precisely ? —(I am not asking: why do you call it a proof of A)! 
What has this complex to do with A, ? Any reply will have to make 
me awate of the relation between A and B which is expressed in 
Vi! 


Someone shows us B, and explains to us the relationship with 
A,, that is, that the right side of A was obtained in such and such 
a manner etc. etc. We understand him; and he asks us: is that a 
proof of A? We would answer: certainly xot! 


1. “V” denotes a definition which will be given below, p. 441. In the manu- 
script that passage comes somewhat earlier than the remark above. The pas- 
sage runs: “‘And if we now settle by definition: 

fa+(b+ D2 (a+b)+1] & [at+(b+(ct+ 1) £at+(b+o)) + 1] & 
&[(a+b)+(c+1)% 
=((a+b)+c)+1.2%a+(b+c).¥.(at+b)+c...U) 

and in general: [f,(1) = £,(1)] & [f,(¢ + 1) ££,(c) +1} & 

& [B(c + 1) = (ce) + 1] .°8 (£0). 3-£(0) -.. V)” 

“¥” is mentioned in the context below. V here is a definition of 3). (Ed.) 


416 


Had we understood everything there was to understand about 
the proof? Had we seen the general form of the connection between 
A and B? Yes! 

We might also infer from that that in this way we can construct 
a B from every A and sherefore conversely an A from every B as well. 


The proof is constructed on a definite plan (a plan used to 
construct other proofs as well). But this plan cannot make the 
proof a proof. For all we have here is one of the embodiments of 
the plan, and we can altogether disregard the plan as a general 
concept. The proof has to speak for itself and the plan is only 
embodied in it, it isn’t itself a constituent part of the proof. (That 
is what I’ve been wanting to say all the time). Hence it’s no use to 
me if someone draws my attention to the similarity between 
proofs in order to convince me that they are proofs. 


Isn’t our principle: not to use a concept-word where one isn’t 
necessaty ? — That means, in cases where the concept word really 
stands for an enumeration, to say so. 


When I said earlier “that isn’t a proof”? I meant ‘proof’ in an 
already established sense according to which it can be gathered 
from A and B by themselves. In this sense I can say: I understand 
perfectly well what B does and what relationship it has to A; all 
further information is superfluous and what is there isn’t a proof. 
In this sense Iam concerned only with A and B; I don’t see anything 
beyond them, and nothing else concerns me. 

If I do this, I can see clearly enough the relationship in accor- 
dance with the rule V, but it doesn’t enter my head to use it as an 
expedient in construction. If someone told me while I was con- 
sidering B and A that there is a rule according to which we could 
have constructed B from A (or conversely), I could only say to 
him “don’t bother me with irrelevant trivialities.”” Because of 
course it’s something that’s obvious, and I see immediately that it 
doesn’t make B a proof of A. For the general rule couldn’t shew 
that B is a proof of A and not of some other proposition, unless it were 


417 


a proof in the first place. That means, that the fact that the con- 
nection between B and A is in accordance with a rule can’t show 
that B is a proof of A. Any and every such connection could be 
used as a construction of B from A (and conversely). 


So when I said “R certainly isn’t used for the construction, so 
we have no concern with it” I should have said: I am only con- 
cerned with A and B. It is enough if I confront A and B with each 
other and ask: “‘is B a proof of A>” So I don’t need to construct A 
from B according to a previously established rule; it is sufficient 
for me to place the particular As — however many there are — in 
confrontation with particular Bs. I don’t need a previously es- 
tablished construction rule (a rule needed to obtain the As). 


What I mean is: in Skolem’s calculus we don’t need any such 
concept, the list és sufficient. 

Nothing is lost if instead of saying “we have proved the funda- 
mental laws A in this fashion” we merely show that we can co- 


ordinate with them constructions that resemble them in certain 
respects. 


The concept of generality (and of recursion) used in these proofs 


has no greater generality than can be read immediately from the 
proofs. 


The bracket } in R, which unites «, B, and y! can’t mean any more 
than that we regard the step in A (ora step of the form A) as justified 


1. The schema R above, p. 414. In the manuscript shortly after this schema 
there follows the remark: 


“T have put a bracket } between a, 8, y and A, as if it was self-evident what this 
bracket meant. 


One might conjecture that the bracket meant the same as an equals sign. 
Such a bracket, incidentally, might be put between “1.0/0.3” and “1:3 = 0.3”. 


418 


if the terms (sides) of the steps are related to each other in the ways 
characterized by the schema B. B then takes the place of A. And 
just as before we said: the step is permitted in my calculus if it 
corresponds to one of the As, so we now say: it is permitted if it 
corresponds to one of the Bs. 

But that wouldn’t mean we had gained any simplification or 
reduction. 


We are given the calculus of equations. In that calculus “proof” 
has a fixed meaning. If I now call the inductive calculation a proof, 
it isn’t a proof that saves me checking whether the steps in the chain 
of equations have been taken in accordance with these particular 
rules (or paradigms). If they have been, I say that the last equation 
of the chain is proved, or that the chain of equations is correct. 


Suppose that we were using the first method to check the cal- 
culation(a + b)? =... and at the first step someone said: “yes, that 
step was certainly taken in accordance with a(b+c)=a.b+a.c, 
but is ¢hat right >” And then we showed him the inductive deriva- 
tion of that equation. — 


The question “‘Is the equation G right ?!”’ means in one meaning: 
can it be derived in accordance with the paradigms ? — In the other 
case it means: can the equations a, 8, y be derived in accordance 
with the paradigm (or the paradigms?) — And here we have put 
the two meanings of the question (or of the word “proof’’) on the 
same level (expressed them in a single system) and can now com- 
pare them (and see that they are not the same). 


And indeed the new proof doesn’t give you what you might 
expect: it doesn’t base the calculus on a smaller foundation — as 
happens if we replace pvq and ~p by p|q, or reduce the number of 
axioms, or something similar. For if we now say that all the basic 
equations A have been derived from ¢ alone, the word “derived” 
here means something quite different. (After this promise we expect 


1. Earlier version: .. . the question “is that too right ?” 


419 


the big links in the chain to be replaced by smaller ones, not by two 
half links.!) And in one sense these derivations leave everything as 
it was. For in the new calculus the links of the old one essentially 
continue to exist as links. The old structure is zo¢ taken to pieces. 
So that we have to say the proof goes on in the same way as before. 
And in the o/d sense the irreducibility remains. 


So we can’t say that Skolem has put the algebraic system on to a 
smaller foundation, for he hasn’t ‘given it foundations’ in the 
same sense as is used in algebra. 


In the inductive proof doesn’t « show a connection between the 
As? And doesn’t this show that we are here concerned with proofs ? 
— The connection shown is not the one that breaking up the A 


_ Steps into p steps would establish. And ome connection between the 


As is already visible before any proof. 


I can write the rule R like shés 


at(1+1) = (at+1)4+1 
at+(E+1) (a+&4+1 S 
at((E+1)+1) (a+(€4+1))4+1 


or like this: 
a+(b+1)=(a+b)+1 


if I take R or S as a definition or substitute for that form’. 


1. See below, p. 426. 

2. Compare the form of the rule R on p. 433 below. In the manuscript Wittgen- 
stein introduced this formulation thus: “Perhaps the matter will become 
clearer, if we give the following rule for addition instead of the recursive rule 
‘at(b+1=@t+b+r 

at(1+1)=(a+1)41 
at(+1)4+1)=(a+1)4+1)4+1 
at(at+y)+)+)=(@tit++)4+1 
--- €tc.... 


420 


If I then say that the steps in accordance with the rule R are 
justified thus: 


aw a+(b+1)=(a+b)+1 
B at(b+(c+1))=at(b+o+1)=@tbt+o)+1}) B 
y (atb)+(c+1)=(@tb)+o+1 


you can reply: “If that’s what you call a justification, then you have 
justified the steps. But you haven’t told us any more than if you had 
just drawn our attention to the rule R and its formal relationship 
to «(or to «, 8, and y).”’ 

So I might also have said: I take the rule R in such and such 
a way as a paradigm for my steps. 

Suppose now that Skolem, following his proof of the associative 
law, takes the step to: 

ati=i1+a 
a+(b+1)=(a+b)+1 
(b+1)+a=b4+(1+a)=b+(at+1)=(b+a)41 


If he says the first and third steps in the third line are justified 
according to the already proved associative law, that tells us no 
more than if he said the steps were taken in accordance with the 
paradigm a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c (ie. they correspond to the 
paradigm) and a schema «, 8, y was derived by steps according to 
the paradigm «.- “But does B justify these steps, or not?” — 
“What do you mean by the word ‘justify’? — “Well, the step is 


We write this rule in the form, |1,& G+ 1| thus 
at(at+1)=(at+1)+1 


at(E+1) @+&4+1 R 
at+(Etn+n(@+h)+nyt+1 
In the application of the rule R . . . a ranges over the series |1, &, § + 1.” 


He then says of #his rule that it can be written also in the form S or in the form 
a+(b+1)=(a+b)+1. 


421 


justified if a theorem really has been proved that holds for all 
numbers” — But in what case would that have happened? What 
do you call a proof that a theorem holds for all cardinal numbers ? 
How do you know whether a theorem is really valid for all cardinal 
numbers, since you can’t test it? Your only criterion is the proof 
itself. So you stipulate a form and call it the form of the proof that 
a proposition holds for all cardinal numbers. In that case we really 
gain nothing by being first shown the general form of these proofs; 
for that doesn’t show that the individual proof really gives us 
what we want from it; because, I mean, it doesn’t justify the proof 
or demonstrate that it is a proof of a theorem for all cardinal 
numbers. Instead, the recursive proof has to be its own justifica- 
tion. If we really want to justify our proof procedure as a proof of 
a generalisation of this kind, we do something different: we give a 
series of examples and then we are satisfied by the examples and the 
law we recognize in them, and we say: yes our proof really gives 
us what we want. But we must remember that by giving this series 
of examples we have only translated the notations B and C into a 
different notation. (For the series of examples is not an incomplete 
application of the general form, but another expression of the law.) 
An explanation in word-language of the proof (of what it proves) 
only translates the proof into another form of expression: because 
of this we can drop the explanation altogether. And if we do so, the 
mathematical relationships become much clearer, no longer 
obscured by the equivocal expressions of word-language. For 
example, if I put B right beside A, without interposing any ex- 
pression of word-language like “for all cardinal numbers, etc.” 
then the misleading appearance of a proof of A by B cannot arise. 
We then see quite soberly how far the relationships between B 
and A and a+ b=b-+a extend and where they stop. Only thus 
do we learn the real structure and important features of that 
telationship, and escape the confusion caused by the form of 
word-language, which makes everything uniform. 

Here we see first and foremost that we are interested in the tree 


Ona a tette eSS EBTaT 


of the structures B, C, etc., and that in it is visible on all sides, like 
a particular kind of branching, the following form 


o(1) = Y(2) 
p(n + 1) = F(pn) 
(n+ 1) = F(pn) 


These forms turn up in different arrangements and combinations 
but they are not elements of the construction in the same sense as 
the paradigms in the proof of (a + (b+ (c+ 1))) =(a+(b+o))+1 
or(a +b)? =a? + 2ab + b?. The aim of the “‘recursive proofs” is of 
course to connect the algebraic calculus with the calculus of num- 
bers. And the tree of the recursive proofs doesn’t “justify” the 
algebraic calculus unless that is supposed to mean that it connects 
it with the arithmetical one. It doesn’t justify it in the sense in 
which the list of paradigms justifies the algebraic calculus, i.e. the 
steps in it. 

So tabulating the paradigms for the steps makes sense in the 
cases where we are interested in showing that such and such 
transformations are all made by means of those transition forms, 
arbitrarily chosen as they are. But it doesn’t make sense where the 
calculation is to be justified in another sense, where mere looking 
at the calculation — independently of any comparison with a table 
of previously established norms — must shew us whether we are 
to allow it or not. Skolem did not have to promise us any proof of 
the associative and commutative laws; he could simply have said 
he would show us a connection between the paradigms of algebra 
and the calculation rules of arithmetic. But isn’t this hair-splitting ? 
Hasn’t he reduced the number of paradigms? Hasn’t he, for 
instance, replaced very pair of laws with a single one, namely, 
a+(b+1)=(a+b)+ 1? No. When we prove e.g. (a + b)* = ete. 
(k) we can while doing so make use of the previously proved 
proposition (a + b)? = etc. (1). But in that case the steps in k which 
are justified by | can also be justified by the rules used to prove 1. 
And then the relation of | to those first rules is the same as that of a 
sign introduced by definition to the primary signs used to define 
it: we can always eliminate the definitions and go back to the 
primary signs. But when we take a step in C that is justified by B, 


423

we can’t take the same step with a+(b+1)=(a+b)+1 alone. 
What is called proof here doesn’t break a step in to smaller steps 
but does something quite different.

The recursive proof does not reduce the number of fundamental laws 


So here we don’t have a case where a group of fundamental laws 
is proved by a smaller set while everything else in the proofs 
remains the same. (Similarly in a system of fundamental concepts 
nothing is altered in the later development if we use definitions to 
reduce the number of fundamental concepts.) 

(Incidentally, how very dubious is the analogy between “funda- 
mental laws” and “fundamental concepts”’!) 


It is something like this: all that the proof of a ci-devant fanda- 
mental proposition does is to continue the system of proofs 
backwards. But the recursive proofs don’t continue backwards 
the system of algebraic proofs (with the old fundamental laws); they 
are a new system, that seems only to run parallel with the first one. 


It is a strange observation that in the inductive proofs the irre- 
ducibility (independence) of the fundamental rules must show 
itself after the proof no less than before. Suppose we said the same 
thing about the case of normal proofs (or definitions), where 
fundamental rules ave further reduced, and a new relationship 
between them is discovered (or constructed). 


If I am right that the independence remains intact after the 
recursive proof, that sums up everything I have to say against the 
concept of recursive “proof”. 


The inductive proof doesn’t break up the step in A. Isn’t it that 
that makes me baulk at calling it a proof? It’s that that tempts me 
to say that whatever it does — even if it is constructed by R and a 
— it can’t do more than show something about the step. 


425 


If we imagine a mechanism constructed from cogwheels made 
simply out of uniform wedges held together by a ring, it is still 
the cogwheels that remain in a certain sense the units of the 
mechanism. 


It is like this: if the barrel is made of hoops and wattles, it is 
these, combined as they are (as a complex) that hold the liquid 
and form new units as containers. 


Imagine a chain consisting of links which can each be replaced 
by two smaller ones. Anything which is anchored by the chain can 
also be anchored entirely by the small links instead of by the large 
ones. But we might also imagine every link in the chain being made 
of two parts, each perhaps shaped like half a ring, which together 
formed a link, but could not individually be used as links. 

Then it wouldn’t mean at all the same to say, on the one hand: 
the anchoring done by the large links can be done entirely by small 
links — and on the other hand: the anchoring can be done entirely 
by half large links. What is the difference ? 


One proof replaces a chain with large links by a chain with small 
links, the other shows how one can put together the old large 
links from several parts. 


The similarity as well as the difference between the two cases is 
obvious. 


Of course the comparison between the proof and the chain is a 


logical comparison and therefore a completely exact expression 
of what it illustrates.

Recurring decimals 


1/3 = 0% 


We regard the periodicity of a fraction, e.g. of 1/3 as consisting 
in the fact that something called the extension of the infinite 
decimal contains only threes; we regard the fact that in this 
division the remainder is the same as the dividend as a mere symp- 
tom of this property of the infinite extension. Or else we correct 
this view by saying that it isn’t an infinite extension that has this 
property, but an infinite series of finite extensions; and it is of this 
that the property of the division is a symptom. We may then say: 
the extension taken to one term is 0°3, to two terms 0°33, to three 
terms 0-333 and so on. That is a ra/e and the “‘and so on’”’ refers to 
the regularity; the rule might also be written” [o-3, o&, o0°E3|” 
But what is proved by the division 1/3 = 0-3 is /Aés regularity in 

I 
contrast to another, not regularity in contrast to irregularity. The 
periodic division 1/3 =0-3 (in contrast to 1/3 = 0-3) proves a 
I I 
periodicity in the quotient, that is it determines the rule (the repe- 
tend), it lays it down; it isn’t a symptom that a regularity is “al- 
ready there”. Where is it already? In things like the particular 
expansions that I have written on this paper. But they aren’t 
“the expansions”. (Here we are misled by the idea of unwritten 
ideal extensions, which are a phantasm like those ideal, undrawn, 
geometric straight lines of which the actual lines we draw are 
mere tracings.) When I said “‘the ‘and so on’ refers to the regularity” 
I was distinguishing it from the ‘and so on’ in “‘he read all the 
letters of the alphabet: a, b, c and so on”. When I say “‘the exten- 
sions of 1/3 ate 0-3, 0°33, 0-333 and so on’’ I give three three ex- 


427 


tensions and —a rule. That is the only thing that is infinite, and 
only in the same way as the division 1 /3 = 0°3 
I 


One can say of the sign 0-3 that it is not an abbreviation. 


And the sign “‘|o-3.0-8, 0-€3|” isn’t a substitute for an exten- 
sion, but the undevalued sign itself; and “‘o-3” does just as well. 
It should give us food for thought, that a sign like ‘“‘o-3” is enough 
to do what we need. It isn’t a mere substitute in the calculus there 
are no substitutes. 

If you think that the peculiar property of the division 1/3 = 0°3 

i 

is a symptom of the periodicity of the infinite decimal fraction, 
ot the decimal fractions of the expansion, it is indeed a sign that 
something zs regular, but what? The extensions that I have con- 
structed ? But there aren’t any others. It would be a most absurd 
manner of speaking to say: the property of the division is an 
indication that the result has the form “‘o-a, o-&, o-€a|”; that is 
like wanting to say that a division was an indication that the result 
was a number. The sign “o-3” does not express its meaning from 
any greater distance than “‘o-333...”, because this sign gives an 
extension of three terms and a rule; the extension 0-333 is in- 
essential for our purposes and so there remains only the rule, 
which is given just as well by “‘|o-3, 0-8, 0-&3|”. The proposition 
“After the first place the division is periodic” just means “The first 
remainder is the same as the dividend”’. Or again: the proposition 
“After the first place the division will yield the same number to 
infinity’’, means “The first remainder is the same as the dividend”, 
just as the proposition “This straightedge has an infinite radius” 
meanis it is straight. 

We might now say: the places of a quotient of 1/3 are necessarily 


428 


all 3s, and all that could mean would be again that the first re- 
mainder is like the dividend and the first place of the quotient is 3. 
The negation of the first proposition is therefore equivalent to the 
negation of the second. So the opposite of “‘necessarily all” isn’t 
what one might call ‘accidentally all”’ ; “‘necessarily all’ is as it were 
one word. I only have to ask: what is the criterion of the necessary 
generalization, and what would be the criterion of the accidental 
generalization (the criterion for all numbers accidentally having the 


property ¢)? 


429

The recursive proof as a series of proofs 


A “recursive proof” is the general term of a series of proofs. 
So it is a law for the construction of proofs. To the question how 
this general form can save me the proof ofa particular proposition, 
e.g. 7+(8+9)=(7+8)+9, the answer is that it merely gets 
everything ready for the proof of the proposition, it doesn’t 
prove it (indeed the proposition doesn’t occur in it). The proof 
consists rather of the general form plus the proposition. 


Our normal mode of expression carries the seeds of confusion 
tight into its foundations, because it uses the word “series” both 
in the sense of “extension’’, and in the sense of “law’’. The 
relationship of the two can be illustrated by a machine for making 
coiled springs, in which a wire is pushed through a helically shaped 


passage to make as many coils as are desired. What is called an 
infinite helix need not be anything like a finite piece of wire, or 
something that that approaches the longer it becomes; it is the 
law of the helix, as it is embodied in the short passage. Hence the 
expression “‘infinite helix” or “‘infinite series”’ is misleading. 


So we can always write out the recursive proof as a limited 
series with “and so on” without its losing any of its rigour. At the 
same time this notation shows more clearly its relation to the 
equation A. For then the recursive proof no longer looks at all like 
a justification of A in the sense of an algebraic proof —like the proof 


430 


TERA EAN PURGE AF NE LT 


of (a + b)? = a? + zab + b?. That proof with algebraic calculation 
rules is quite like calculation with numbers. 


s+(4t3)=54+4424+))=54+(4424+)=

=(554(4+0D4+1)+1=(5+44+))+)N+1= 
=((+4)+0+1)t1=(54+4)+2)+1=(65 +4) +3)---C) 


That is a proof of 5 +(4+ 3) =(5 +4) + 3, but we can also let 
it count, i.e. use it, as a proof of 5( + (4+ 4) =(5 + 4) + 4, ete. 

If I say that L is the proof of the proposition a + (b + c) = (a+ b) 
+c, the oddness of the step from the proof to the proposition 
becomes much more obvious. 


Definitions merely introduce practical abbreviations; we could 
get along without them. But is that true of recursive definitions ? 


Two different things might be called applications of the rule 
a+(b+1)=(a+b)+1: in one sense 4+(2+1)=(4+2)+1 
is an application, in another sense 4+(2+1)=((44+1)+0) +1 
=(4+2)+11s. 


The recursive definition is a rule for constructing replacement 
rules, or else the general term of a series of definitions. It is a 
signpost that shows the same way to all expressions of a certain 
form. 


As we said, we might write the inductive proof without using 
letters at all (with no loss of rigour). Then the recursive definition 
a+(b+1)=(a+b)+1 would have to be written as a series of 
definitions. As things are, this series is concealed in the explanation 
of its use. Of course we can keep the letters in the definition for the 
sake of convenience, but in that case in the explanation we have to 
bring in a sign like “1, (1)+1, ((1)+1)+1 and so on”, or, 
what boils down to the same thing, “|1, &, + 1|”. But here we 
mustn’t believe that this sign should really be “(&).|1, & € + 1|”! 


431 


The point of our formulation is of course that the concept “all 
numbers”’ is given only by a structure like “|1, &, €+1|”. The 
generality is set ov¢ in the symbolism by this structure and cannot be 
described by an (x). fx. 

Of course the so-called “recursive definition” isn’t a definition 
in the customary sense of the word, because it isn’t an equation, 
since the equation “a+(b+1)=(a+b)+1” is only a part of it. 
Nor is it a logical product of equations. Instead, it is a law for the 
construction of equations; just as |1, €, € + 1| isn’t a number but a 
law etc. (The bewildering thing about the proof of a+(b+c) 
=(a+b)+c is of course that it’s supposed to come out of the 
definition alone. But « isn’t a definition, but a general rule for 
addition). 

On the other hand the generality of this rule is no different from 
that of the periodic division 1/3 = 0-3. That means, there isn’t 
i 
anything that the rule leaves open or in need of completion or the 

like. 

Let us not forget: the sign “|1, , + 1|”...N interests us not 
as a striking expression for the general term of the series of cardinal 
numbers, but only in so far as it is contrasted with signs of similar 
construction. N as opposed to something like |2, & & + 3|; in short, 
as a sign, or an instrument, in a calculus. And of course the same 
holds for 1/3 = 0-3. (The only thing left open in the rule is its 

I 
application.)

432 


We might write the rule “a + (b + 1) =(a+ b) + 1”, thus.! 


at+(i+31)=(a+1)4+1 

{ Y 

a+(E+1) (at+&)+1 R 
at(Etp+1) (@+8 +1) +1 


In the application of the rule R (and the description of the 
application is of course an inherent part of the sign for the rule), a 
ranges over the series |1, &, € + 1|; and of course that might be 
expressly stated by an additional sign, say “aN”. (We might call 
the second and third lines of the rule R taken together the operation, 
like the second and third term of the sign N.) Thus too the explana- 
tion of the use of the recursive definition “a +(b +1) =(a +b) 
+1” is a part of that rule itself; or if you like a repetition of the 
rule in another form; just as “1, 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 1 and so on” means 
the same as (i.e. is translatable into) “|1, &, £ + 1|”. The translation 
into word-language casts light on the calculus with the new signs, 
because we have already mastered the calculus with the signs 
of word-language. 

The sign of a rule, like any other sign, is a sign belonging toa 
calculus; its job isn’t to hypnotize people into accepting an applica- 
tion, but to be used in the calculus in accordance with a system. 
Hence the exterior form is no more essential than that of an arrow 
—>; what is essential is the system in which the sign for the rule is 
employed. The system of contraries — so to speak ~ from which the 
sign is distinguished etc. 

What I am here calling the description of the application is itself 
of course something that contains an ‘“‘and so on”, and so it can 
itself be no more than a supplement to or substitute for the rule- 
sign. 


What is the contradictory of a general proposition like a+(b + 
(1+ 1))=a+((b+1) +1)? What is the system of propositions 
within which this proposition is negated ? Or again, how, and in 
what form, can this proposition come into contradiction with 
others ? What question does it answer? Certainly not the question 


1. Cf, footnote, p. 420. 


433 


whether (n).fn or (dn). ~ fn is the case, because it is the rule R that 
contributes to the generality of the proposition. The generality of 
a tule is ¢o ipso incapable of being brought into question. 

Now imagine the general rule written as a series 


Pi1> Piz, Pi3--- 
P21» Paz, Pa3--- 
P31. P32> P33 --- 


and then negated. If we regard it as (x). fx, then we are treating it 
as a logical product and its opposite is the logical sum of the 
denials of p,,, p,2 etc. This disjunction can be combined with any 
random product py,-P21-P22 +++ Pma- (Certainly if you compare 
the proposition with a logical product, it becomes infinitely 
significant and its opposite void of significance). (But remember 
that the “and so on”’ in the proposition comes after a comma, not 
after an “and” (“.”) The “and so on” is not a sign of incomplete- 
neSS.) 

Is the rule R infinitely significant? Like an enormously long 
logical product ? 

That one can run the number series though the rule is a form 
that is given; nothing is affirmed about it and nothing can be denied 
about it. 

Running the stream of numbers through is not something which 
I can say I can prove. I can only prove something about the form, 
or pattern, through which I run the numbers. 

But can’t we say that the general number rule a+ (b+) = 
(a+b)+c...A)has the same generality asa+(1+1)=(a+1)+1 
(in that the latter holds for every cardinal number and the former 
for every triple of cardinal numbers) and that the inductive 
proof of A justifies the rule AP Can we say that we can give the 
tule A, since the proof shows that it is always right ? Does 1/3 = 0°3 

I 
justify the rule . 

1/3 = 0°3, 1/3 = 0°333, 1)3 = 0.333 and so on?”’.. .P) 

A is a completely intelligible rule; just like the replacement rule P. 
But I can’t give such a rule, for the reason that I can already cal- 


434 


reve ay 


culate the particular instances of A by another rule; just as | cannot 
give Pasa rule if I have givena rule whereby I can calculate 1 } 3=0%3 
etc. 


How would it be if someone wanted to lay down “‘25 x 25 =625” 
as a rule in addition to the multiplication rules. (1 don’t say 
“25 x 25 = 6247!) — 25 xX 25 = 625 only makes sense if the kind of 
calculation to which the equation belongs is already known, and 
it only makes sense in connection with that calculation. A only 
makes sense in connection with A’s own kind of calculation. 
For the first question here would be: is that a stipulation, or a 
derived proposition? If 25 x 25 = 625 is a stipulation, then the 
multiplication sign does not mean the same as it does, e.g. in 
reality (that is, we are dealing with a different kind of calculation). 
And if A is a stipulation, it doesn’t define addition in the same way 
as if it is a derived proposition. For in that case the stipulation is of 
course a definition of the addition sign, and the rules of calculation 
that allow A to be worked out are a different definition of the same 
sign. Here I mustn’t forget that «, 8, y isn’t the proof of A, but only 
the form of the proof, or of what is proved; so «, 8, y is a definition 
of A. 

Hence I can only say “25 x 25 = 625 is proved” if the method of 
proof is fixed independently of the specific proof. For it is this 
method that settles the meaning of “€ x y”’ and so settles what is 


proved. So to that extent the form a.b = c belongs to the method 
a 
of proof that explains the sense of c. Whether I have calculated 
correctly is another question. And similarly «, 8, y belong to the 
method of proof that defines the sense of the proposition A. 
Arithmetic is complete without a rule like A; without it it 
doesn’t lack anything. The proposition A is introduced into 
arithmetic with the discovery of a periodicity, with the construc- 
tion of a zew calculus. Before this discovery or construction a 
question about the correctness of that proposition would have as 
little sense as a question about the correctness of “1/3 = 0°3, 
1/3 = 0°33... ad inf.” 


435 


The stipulation of P is not the same thing as the proposition 
“1/3 = 0-3”? and in that sense “a + (b+ €) =(a +b) + 6) is different 
from a rule (stipulation) such as A. The two belong to different 
calculi. The proof of «, 8, y is a proof or justification of a rule like 
A only in so far as it is the general form of the proof of arithmetical 
propositions of the form A. 


Periodicity is not a sign (symptom) of a decimal’s recurring; the 
expression “it goes on like that for ever” is only a translation of the 
sign for periodicity into another form of expression. (If there was 
something other than the periodic sign of which periodicity was 
only a symptom, that something would have to have a specific 
expression, which could be nothing less than the complete ex- 
pression of that something.)

Earlier I spoke of the use of connection lines, underlining etc. 
to bring out the corresponding, homologous, parts of the equa- 
tions of a recursion proof. In the proof

that « corresponds to; and B does not correspond to & but & 
corresponds to § and « to and 8 to y and ¥ to u, not to 8, and so on. 


What about a calculation like 
(Sa) (eB) AE 8) a5 Ae 3) 96 3) = 
=SSTS-RSSHZZ= SH +2-5.5 437..-R) 
from which we can also read a general rule for the squaring of a 
binomial ? 
We can as it were look at this calculation arithmetically or alge- 
braically. 


437 


This difference between the two ways of looking at it would 
have been brought out e.g. if the example had been written 


a 8 
(5 +2)? = 52 42.2.5 +22 


In the algebraic way of looking at it we would have to distinguish 
the 2 in the position marked « from the 2s in the positions marked B 
but in the arithmetical one they would not need to be distinguished. 
We are — I believe — using a different calculus in each case. 


According to one but not the other way of looking at it the 
calculation above, for instance, would be a proof of (7 + 8)? = 
82 +. 2.7.8 + 82. 


We might work out an example to make sure that (a + b)? is 
equal to a? + b? + 2ab, not to a? + b? + 3ab — if we had forgotten 
it for instance; but we couldn’t check in that sense whether the 
formula holds generally. But of course there is that sort of check 
too, and in the calculation 


eo) ee red nO ae 
I might check whether the 2 in the second summand is a general 


feature of the equation or something that depends on the particular 
numbers occurring in the example. 


Iturn(5 + 2)? = 5? + 2.2.5 into another sign, if I write 
ae = B - 
G+ 3)? = 57+ 2.2.5 + 22 
and thus “indicate which features of the right hand side originate 
from the particular numbers on the left’’ etc. 


(Now I realize the importance of this process of coordination. 
It expresses a new way of looking at the calculation and therefore 
a way of looking at a new calculation.) 


‘In order to prove A’ — we could say — I first of all have to draw 
attention to quite definite features of B. (As in the division 
10/3 = 0°3). 

I

(And « had no suspicion, so to speak, of what I see if I do.) 
Here the relationship between generality and proof of generality 
is like the relationship between existence and proof of existence. 


When «, 8, y are proved, the general calculus has still to be 
discovered. 


Writing “a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c” in the induction series 
seems to us a matter of course, because we don’t see that by doing 
so we are starting a totally new calculus. (A child just learning to 
do sums would see clearer than we do in this connection.) 


Certain features are brought out by the schema R; they could be 
specially marked thus:! 


f, (2) f, (1) 
at(b+1)=(a+b)+1 
f, (c+1) fe (a 


a+(b+(c+1)) =|a+(b+c)|+1 
f, (c + 1) f, (c) +1 
~—eF—e— ——— 
(at+b)+(ct+1) =l@+b)+e]+1 
Of course it would also have been enough (i.e. it would have been 
a symbol of the same multiplicity) if we had written B and added 
fE=at+(b+ &), f,E=@+b)+é 


(Here we must also remember that every symbol - however 
explicit — can be misunderstood.) 


The first person to draw attention to the fact that B can be seen 
in that way introduces a new sign whether or not he goes on to 
attach special marks to B or to write the schema R beside it. In 


1. The schema R as above on p. 414. Cf B on p. 397. (Ed.) 


439 


the latter case R itself is the new sign, or, if you prefer, B plus R. 
It is the way in which he draws attention to it that produces the 
new sign. 


We might perhaps say that here the lower equation is used as 
a+b=b +4; or similarly that here B is used as A, by being as it 
were read sideways, Or: B was used as A, but the new proposition 
was built up from «.8.-y, in such a way that though A is now read 
out of B, «.8.y don’t appear in the sort of abbreviation in which 
the premisses turn up in the conclusion. 


What does it mean to say: “I am drawing your attention to the 
fact that the same sign occurs here in both function signs (perhaps 
you didn’t notice it)” ? Does that mean that he didn’t understand 
the proposition ? — After all, what he didn’t notice was something 
which belonged essentially to the proposition; it wasn’t as if it 
was some external property of the proposition he hadn’t noticed 
(Here again we see what kind of thing is called “‘understanding a 
proposition’’.) 


Of course the picture of reading a sign lengthways and sideways 
is once again a /ogical picture, and for that reason it is a perfectly 
exact expression of a grammatical relation. We mustn’t say of it 
“it’s a mere metaphor, who knows what the facts are really like?” 


When I said that the new sign with the marks of emphasis must 
have been derived from the old one without the marks, that was 
meaningless, because of course I can consider the sign with the 
marks without regard to its origin. In that case it presents itself 
to me as three equations [Frege]', that is as the shape of three 
equations with certain underlinings, etc. 


1. Cf. perhaps: Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, Tl, p. 114, 115 §§ 107, 108. Wais- 
mann cited excerpts from these §§. (Witigenstein und der Wiener Kreis, 
pp. 150-151). Cfhere Wittgenstein’s remarks on them (ibid. pp. 151-157). (Ed.) 


440 


It is certainly significant that this shape is quite similar to the 
three equations without the underlinings; it is also significant that 
the cardinal number 1 and the rational number 1 are governed by 
similar rules; but that does not prevent what we have here from 
being a new sign. What I am now doing with this sign is something 
quite new. 


Isn’t this like the supposition I once made that people might 
have operated the Frege-Russell calculus of truth-functions with 
the signs “‘~”’ and “‘.”? combined into ““~p. ~ q’’ without anyone 
noticing, and that Sheffer, instead of giving a new definition, 
had merely drawn attention to a property of the signs already in 
use. 


We might have gone on dividing without ever becoming aware 
of recurring decimals. When we have seen them, we have seen 
something new. 


But couldn’t we extend that and say “I might have multiplied 
numbers together without ever noticing the special case in which I 
multiply a number by itself; and that means x? is not simply x.x”’ ? 
We might call the invention of the sign ‘x?’ the expression of our 
having become aware of that special case. Or, we might have gone 
on multiplying a by b and dividing it by c without noticing that we 


“ec ?> 


. 


could write 


as ‘“‘a. (b|c)”’ or that the latter is similartoa.b. Or 


again, this is like a savage who doesn’t yet see the analogy between 


[|||| and |||I[|, or between || and |||]. 


fat(b+1)£(a+b)+1] & fat (b+(c+ )) £t(b+o)41] 
& [(a+b)+(c+1)4((at+b)+0)41].2.at+(b4+0).9. 
(a+b)+c...U) 

and in general: 
[F,(x) © £(1)] & [F,(e + 1) 2 £,(c) + 1] & [(c +1) = 
= f,(c) + 1].22.£,(c).3.£,(c)...V) 


You might see the definition U, without knowing why I use 
that abbreviation. 

You might see the definition without understanding its point. -— 
But its point is something new, not something already contained 
in it as a specific replacement rule. 


Of course, “‘3”’ isn’t an equals-sign in the same sense as the ones 
occurring in «, B, y. 

But we can easily show that “3” has certain formal properties 
in common with =. 


It would be incorrect — according to the postulated rules — to use 
the equals-sign like this: 


A... |(a+b)=a.(a+b)+b.a+b)=...= 
=a? + 2ab + b?|. = .|(a+ b)? =a? + 2ab + b?| 


if that is supposed to mean that the left hand side is the proof of the 
right. 

But mightn’t we imagine this equation regarded as a definition ? 
For instance, if it had always been the custom to write out the whole 
chain instead of the right hand side, and we introduced the 
abbreviation. 


Of course A can be regarded as a definition! Because the sign on 
the left hand side is in fact used, and there’s no reason why we 
shouldn’t abbreviate it according to this convention. Only in 
that case either the sign on the right or the sign on the left is used 
in a way different from the one now usual. 


It can never be sufficiently emphasized that sotally different kinds 
of sign-rules get written in the form of an equation. 


The ‘definition’ x.x = x? might be regarded as merely allowing 
us to replace the sign “‘x.x”’ by the sign “x?,” like the definition 
“7 +1 = 2”; but it can also be regarded (and in fact is regarded) as 
allowing us to put a? instead of a.a, and (a+b)? instead of 
(a+b).(a+b) and in such a way that any arbitrary number can 
be substituted for the x. 


442 


A person who discovers that a proposition p follows from one 
of the form q > p.gq constructs a new sign, the sign for that rule. 
(Lam assuming that a calculus with p, q, >, has already been in use, 
and that this rule is now added to make it a new calculus.) 


It is true that the notation “x?” takes away the possibility of 
replacing one of the factors x by another number. Indeed, we could 
imagine two stages in the discovery (or construction) of x?. At 
first, people might have written “x=” instead of ‘“x?”, before it 
occurred to them that there was a system x.x, x.x.x, etc.; later, 
they might have hit upon that too. Similar things have occurred 
in mathematics countless times. (In Liebig’s sign for an oxide 
oxygen did not appear as an element in the same way as what was 
oxidized. Odd as it sounds, we might even today, with all the 
data available to us, give oxygen a similarly privileged position — 
only, of course, in the form of representation—by adopting an 
incredibly artificial interpretation, i.e. grammatical construction.) 


The definitions x.x = x?, x.x.x = x don’t bring anything into 
the world except the signs “x?” and “x?” (and thus so far it isn’t 
necessary to write numbers as exponents). 


| The process of generalization creates a new sign-system. | 


Of course Sheffer’s discovery is not the discovery of the defi- 
nition ~ p.~ q = p|q. Russell might well have given that definition 
without being in possession of Sheffer’s system, and on the other 
hand Sheffer might have built up his system without the definition. 
His system is contained in the use of the signs “~p.~p” for 
“~p” and “~(~p.~q).~(~p.~q)” for “p vq’ andall “p|q’’ doesisto 
permit an abbreviation. Indeed, we can say that someone could 
well have been acquainted with the use of the sign “~(~p.~q). 
~(~p.~q)” for “p v q’’ without recognizing the system p|q.|-p|q 
in it. 


443 


It makes matters clearer if we adopt Frege’s two primitive signs 
“~” and “.”. The discovery isn’t lost if the definitions are written 
~p.~p=~p and ~(~p.~p).~(~q.~q)=p.q. Here apparently 
nothing at all has been altered in the original signs. 


But we might also imagine someone’s having written the whole 
Fregean or Russellian logic in this system, and yet, like Frege, 
calling ““~’’ and “‘.”’ his primitive signs, because he did not see the 
other system in his proposition. 


It is clear that the discovery of Sheffer’s system in ~.p.~p=~p 
and ~(~p.~p).~(~q.~q) = p.q corresponds to the discovery that 
x? + ax + a? is a specific instance of a? + 2ab + b?. 

4 


We don’t see that something can be looked at in a certain way 
until it is so looked at. 
We don’t see that an aspect is possible until it is there. 


That sounds as if Sheffer’s discovery wasn’t capable of being 
represented in signs at all. (Periodic division.) But that is because 
we can’t smuggle the ase of the sign into its introduction (the rule is 
and remains a sign, separated from its application). 


Of course I can only apply the general rule for the induction 
proof when I discover the substitution that makes it applicable. So 
it would be possible for someone to see the equations 


(at+1)+1=(a+1)4+1 
1+(a+1)=(1+a)+1 


without hitting on the substitution 
a= xX, F.Q=x+ 1, F(x+1)=(k+)4+1, 


Foa+1)=14+(x4+1), F,~)=14+x 
i <<a ae, 


444 


Moreover, if I say that I understand the equations as particular 
cases of the rule, my understanding has to be the understanding 
that shows itself in the explanations of the relations between the 
rule and the equations, i.e. what we express by the substitutions. 
If I don’t regard that as an expression of what I understand, then 
nothing is an expression of it; but in that case it makes no sense 
either to speak of understanding or to say that I understand some- 
thing definite. For it only makes sense to speak of understanding 
in cases where we understand ove thing as opposed to another. And 
it is this contrast that signs express. 

Indeed, seeing the internal relation must in its turn be seeing 
something that can be described, something of which one can 
say: “I see that such and such is the case”; it has to be really 
something of the same kind as the correlation-signs (like connec- 
ting lines, brackets, substitutions, etc.). Everything else has to be 
contained in the application of the sign of the general rule in a 
particular case. 


It is as if we had a number of material objects and discovered 
they had surfaces which enabled them to be placed in a continuous 
row. Or rather, as if we discovered that such and such surfaces, 
which we had seen before, enabled them to be placed in a contin- 
uous row. That is the way many games and puzzles are solved. 


The person who discovers periodicity invents a new calculus. 
The question is, how does the calculus with periodic division differ 


from the calculus in which periodicity is unknown? 


(We might have operated a calculus with cubes without having 
had the idea of putting them together to make prisms.) 


445 


Appendix! 
(On: The process of generalization creates a new sign-system) 


It is a very important observation that the c in A is not the same 
variable as the c in 8 and y. So the way I wrote out the proof was 
not quite correct in a respect which is very important for us. In A 
we could substitute n for c, whereas the cs in 8 and y are identical. 

But another question arises: can I derive from A that i+ (k +c) 
=(i+ k)+c?Ifso, why can’t I derive it in the same way from B? 
Does that mean that a and b in A are not identical with a and b in 
a, Band y? 


We see clearly that the variable c in B isn’t identical with the 
cin A if we put a number instead of it. Then B is something like 


a 4+(5 +1) =(4+5)+1 
B44+(5+(64+))=(44+646)+1} ...W 
y 44+5)+(6+131)=(445)+6)+1 


but that doesn’t have corresponding to it an equation like Ay: 
4t+(5+6)=(4+5) +6! 


What makes the induction proof different from a proof of A is 
expressed in the fact that the c in B is not identical with the one in 
A, so that we could use different letters in the two places. 


All that is meant by what I’ve written above is that the reason 
it looks like an algebraic proof of A is that we think we meet the 
same variables a, b, c in the equations A as in a, 8, y and so we 


1. Remarks taken from the Manuscript volume. We must not forget that 
Wittgenstein omitted them. Even in the MS they are not set out together as 
they are here. (Ed.) 


446 


regard A as the result of a transformation of those equations. 
(Whereas of course in reality I regard the signs «, 8, y in quite a 
different way, which means that the c in 8 and y isn’t used as a 
vatiable in the same way as a and b. Hence one can express this 
new view of B, by saying that the c does not occur in A.) 


What I said about the new way of regarding «, 8, y might be 
put like this: « is used to build up 6 and y in exactly the same way 
as the fundamental algebraic equations are used to build up an 
equation like (a + b)? = a? + 2ab + b?. But if that is the way they 
are derived, we are regarding the complex « 8 y in a new way 
when we give the variable c a function which differs from that of 
a and b (c becomes the hole through which the stream of numbers 
has to flow). 


38 
Proof by induction, arithmetic and algebra 


Why do we need the commutative law? Not so as to be able to 
write the equation 4+ 6 =6 + 4, because that equation is justified 
by its own particular proof. Certainly the proof of the commutative 
law can also be used to prove it, but in that case it becomes just a 
particular arithmetical proof. So the reason I need the law, is to 
apply it when using letters. 

And it is this justification that the inductive proof cannot give 
me. 


However, one thing is clear: if the recursive proof gives us the 
right to calculate algebraically, then so does the arithmetical proof 
T. 

Again: the recursive proof is — of course — essentially concerned 
with numbers. But what use are numbers to me when I want to 
operate purely algebraically ? Or again, the recursion proof is only 
of use to me when I want to use it to justify a step in a number- 
calculation. 


But someone might ask: do we need both the inductive proof 
and the associative law, since the latter cannot provide a foundation 
for calculation with numbers, and the former cannot provide one 
for transformations in algebra ? 


Well, before Skolem’s proof was the associative law, for ex- 
ample, just accepted without anyone’s being able to work out the 
corresponding step in a numerical calculation? That is, were we 
previously unable to work out 5 + (4 + 3) =(5 + 4) + 3, and did we 
treat it as an axiom ? 


If I say that the periodic calculation proves the proposition that 


justifies me in those steps, what would the proposition have been 


1. Above, p. 431. 


448 


like if it had been assumed as an axiom instead of being proved? 


What would a proposition be like that permitted one to put 
5 +(7+9)=(5 +7) +9) without being able to prove it? It is 
obvious that there never has been such a proposition. 

But couldn’t we also say that the associative law isn’t used at all 
in arithmetic and that we work only with particular number 
calculations ? 

Even when algebra uses arithmetical notation, it is a totally 
different calculus, and cannot be derived from the arithmetical one. 


To the question “is 5x 4= 207? one might answer: “‘let’s 
check whether it is in accord with the basic rules of arithmetic” 
and similarly I might say: let’s check whether A is in accord with 
the basic rules. But with which rules ? Presumably with «. 


But before we can bring « and A together we need to stipulate 
what we want to call “agreement” here. 


That means that « and A are separated by the gulf between 
arithmetic and algebra,! and if B is to count as a proof of A, this 
gulf has to be bridged over by a stipulation. 


It is quite clear that we do use an idea of this kind of agreement 
when, for instance, we quickly work out a numerical example to 
check the correctness of an algebraic proposition. 

And in this sense I might e.g. calculate 

25 X 16 16 X 25 


25 32 
150 80 
400 400 


1. To repeat,a is:at+(b+1)=(a+b)+1 
Ais:a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c. (Ed.) 


449 


and say: “yes, it’s right, a.b is equal to b.a” — if I imagine that I 
have forgotten. 


Considered as a rule for algebraic calculation, A cannot be 
proved recursively. We would see that especially clearly if we 
wrote down the “recursive proof” as a series of arithmetical 
expressions. Imagine them written down (i.e. a fragment of the 
series plus “and so on”) without any intention of “proving” 
anything, and then suppose someone asks: “does that prove 
a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c?”. We would ask in astonishment “How 
can it prove anything of the kind? The series contains only num- 
bers, it doesn’t contain any letters”. ~ But no doubt we might say: 
if I introduce A as a rule for calculation with letters, that brings 
this calculus in a certain sense into unison with the calculus of the 
catdinal numbers, the calculus I established by the law for the 
rules of addition (the recursive definition a + (b + 1) =(a +b) + I).

VII INFINITY IN MATHEMATICS 
THE EXTENSIONAL VIEWPOINT 


39 
Generality in arithmetic 


“What is the sense of such a proposition as ‘(dn).3 + m= 77?” 
Here we ate in an odd difficulty: on the one hand we feel it to be a 
problem that the proposition has the choice between infinitely 
many values of n, and on the other hand the sense of the proposition 
seems guaranteed in itself and only needing further research on 
our part, because after all we “know ‘what (4x) x’ means”’. If 
someone said he didn’t know what was the sense of “(dn).3+n=7’’, 
he would be answered “‘but you do know what this proposition 
says: 3 +}O=7.V.3+1=7.¥.3 +2=7 and so on!” But to that 
one can reply “Quite correct - so the proposition isn’t a logical 
sum, because a logical sum doesn’t end with ‘and so on’, What I 
am not clear about is this propositional form ‘¢(o) v ¢(1) V ¢ (2) Vv 
and so on’ — and all you have done is to substitute a second unintel- 
ligible kind of proposition for the first one, while pretending to give 
me something familiar, namely a disjunction.” 

That is, if we believe that we do understand “‘(dn) etc.” in some 
absolute sense, we have in mind as a justification other uses of the 


notation “(4...)...”, or of the ordinary-language expression 
“There is... ”’ But to that one can only say: So you are comparing 
the proposition “(An) . . .’? with the proposition “There is a house 


in this city which...” or “There are two foreign words on this 
page’’. But the occurrence of the words “there is” in those sentences 
doesn’t suffice to determine the grammar of this generalization, all 
it does is to indicate a certain analogy in the rules. And so we can 
still investigate the grammar of the generalisation “(dn) etc.” 
with an open mind, that is, without letting the meaning of 
“(4...)... in other cases get in our way. 


“Perhaps all numbers have the property «”. Again the question is: 


what is the grammar of this general proposition? Our being 
acquainted with the use of the expression “all...” in other gram- 
matical systems is not enough. If we say “you do know what it 
means: it means¢(o).e(1).e(2) andso on’’, again nothing is explained 
except that the proposition is zot a logical product. In order to 
understand the grammar of the proposition we ask: how is the 
proposition used? What is regarded as the criterion of its truth? 
What is its verification? —If there is no method provided for 
deciding whether the proposition is true or false, then it is pointless, 
and that means senseless. But then we delude ourselves that there 
is indeed a method of verification, a method which cannot be 
employed, but only because of human weakness. This verification 
consists in checking all the (infinitely many) terms of the product 
e(o).e(1).e(2)... Here there is confusion between physical 
impossibility and what is called ‘logical impossibility’? For we 
think we have given sense to the expression “checking of the 
infinite product” because we take the expression “infinitely many” 
for the designation of an enormously large number. And when we 
hear of “the impossibility of checking the infinite number of propo- 
sitions”’ there comes before our mind the impossibility of checking 
a very large number of propositions, say when we don’t have 
sufficient time. 

Remember that in the sense in which it is impossible to check an 
infinite number of propositions it is also impossible to try to do so. — 
If we are using the words “‘But you do know what ‘all’ means” to 
appeal to the cases in which this mode of speech is used, we cannot 
regard it as a matter of indifference if we observe a distinction 
between these cases and the case for which the use of the words is 
to be explained. — Of course we know what is meant by “checking 
a number of propositions for correctness’, and it is this understand- 
ing that we are appealing to when we claim that one should under- 
stand also the expression “.. . infinitely many propositions’’. But 
doesn’t the sense of the first expression depend on the specific 
experiences that correspond to it? And these experiences are 
lacking in the employment (the calculus) of the second expression; 
if any experiences at all are correlated to it they are fundamentally 
different ones.

Ramsey once proposed to express the proposition that infinitely 
many objects satisfied a function f(£) by the denial of all propositions 


like 


~(Ax) .fx 

(3x) .fx.~(x, y).fx.fy 

(Ax, y).fx.fy.~(4x, y, z).fx.fy.fz 
and so on. 


But this denial would yield the series 


(Ax). fx 
(dx, y).fx.fy 
(AX, ¥-2) cs, CC, etc. 


But this series too is quite superfluous: for in the first place the 
last proposition at any point surely contains all the previous 
ones, and secondly even it is of no use to us, because it isn’t about 
an infinite number of objects. So in reality the series boils down 
to the proposition: 


“(3x, y,z...ad inf.).fx.fy.fz...ad inf.” 


and we can’t make anything of that sign unless we know its gram- 
mar. But one thing is clear: what we are dealing with isn’t a sign of 
the form “(Jx, y, z).fx.fy.fz” but a sign whose similarity to that 
looks purposely deceptive. 


Ican certainly define “m>n” as (4x):m — n= x, but by doing so 
I haven’t in any way analysed it. You think, that by using the 
symbolism “(4...)...” you establish a connection between 
“m>n” and other propositions of the form “there is... i 
what you forget is that that can’t do more than stress a certain 
analogy, because the sign “(3...)...” is used in countlessly 
many different ‘games’. (Just as there is a ‘king’ in chess and 
draughts.) So we have to know the rules governing its use here; 
and as soon as we do that it immediately becomes clear that 


these rules are connected with the rules for subtraction. For if 


453 


we ask the usual question “how do I know — i.e. where do I get it 
from — that there is a number x that satisfies the condition m — n — 
x?” itis the rules for subtraction that provide the answer. And then 
we see that we haven’t gained very much by our definition. Indeed 
we might just as well have given as an explanation of ‘m > n’ the 
tules for checking a proposition of that kind — e.g. (32 > 17’. 


If I say: “given any n there is a § for which the function is less 


‘ ; 
than n”, Iam ipso facto referring to a general arithmetical criterion 
that indicates when F(8) <n. 


If in the nature of the case I cannot write down a number 
independently of a number system, that must be reflected in the 
general treatment of number. A number system is not something 
inferior — like a Russian abacus — that is only of interest to elemen- 


tary schools while a more lofty general discussion can afford to 
disregard it. 


Again, I don’t lose anything of the generality of my account if I 
give the rules that determine the correctness and incorrectness 
(and thus the sense) of ‘m>n’ for a particular system like the 
decimal system. After all I need 2 system, and the generality is 


preserved by giving the rules according to which one system can 
be translated into another. 


A ptoof in mathematics is general if it is generally applicable, 
You can’t demand some other kind of generality in the name of 
rigout. Every proof rests on particular signs, produced on a par- 
ticular occasion. All that can happen is that one type of generality 
may appear more elegant than another. (Cf. the employment of 
the decimal system in proofs concerning § and y)).

AP TORE ET AEE SE EPSP 


“We may imagine a mathematical proposition as a creature which 
itself knows whether it is true or false (in contrast with proposi- 
tions of experience). 

A mathematical proposition itself knows that it is true or that it 
is false. Ifit is about all numbers, it must also survey all the numbers. 
“Its truth or falsity must be contained in it as is its sense.” 


“Tt’s as though the generality of a proposition like ‘(n).«(n)’ 
were only a pointer to the genuine, actual, mathematical generality, 
and not the generality itself. As if the proposition formed a sign 
only in a purely external way and you still needed to give the sign 
a sense from within.” 


“We feel the generality possessed by the mathematical assertion 
to be different from the generality of the proposition proved.” 


“We could say: a mathematical proposition is an allusion to a 
proof.””! 


What would it be like if a proposition itself did not quite grasp 
its sense? As if it were, so to speak, too grand for itself? That is 


really what logicians suppose. 


A proposition that deals with all numbers cannot be thought of 
as verified by an endless striding, for, if the striding is endless, it 
does not lead to any goal. 

Imagine an infinitely long row of trees, and, so that we can 
inspect them, a path beside them. All right, the path must be 
endless. But if it is endless, then that means precisely that you can’t 
walk to the end of it. That is, it does zo¢ put me in a position to 
survey the row. That is to say, the endless path does not have an 
end ‘infinitely far away’, it has no end. 


Nor can you say: “A proposition cannot deal with all the 
numbers one by one, so it has to deal with them by means of the 
concept of number” as if this were a prs aller: “Because we can’t 
do it like #his, we have to do it another way.” But it is indeed 
possible to deal with the numbers one by one, only that does t 


1. Philosophical Remarks, 122, pp. 143-145. 
455 


! 


lead to the totality. That doesn’t lie on the path on which we go 
step by step, not even at the infinitely distant end of that path. 
(This all only means that “e(o). (1). ¢(2) and so on” is not the sign 
for a logical product.) 


“Tt cannot be a contingent matter that all numbers possess a 
property; if they do so it must be essential to them.” — The propo- 
sition “men who have red noses are good-natured” does not have 
the same sense as the proposition “men who drink wine are good- 
natured” even if the men who have red noses are the same as the 
men who drink wine. On the other hand, if the numbers m, n, 0 are 
the extension of a mathematical concept, so that is the case that 
fm .fn.fo, then the proposition that the numbers that satisfy f have 
the property ¢ has the same sense as “e(m).<(n)e.(o)”. This is 
because the propositions “f(m).f(n).f(o)” and “e(m).(n).e(o)” 
can be transformed into each other without leaving the realm of 
grammar. 

Now consider the proposition: “all the n numbers that satisfy 
the condition F(&) happen by chance to have the property e”. Here 
what matters is whether the condition F(é) is a mathematical one. 
If it is, then I can indeed derive e(x) from F(x), if only via the 
disjunction of the n values of F(é). (For what we have in this case is 
in fact a disjunction). So I won’t call this chance. - On the other 
hand if the condition is a non-mathematical one, we can speak of 
chance. For example, if I say: all the numbers I saw today on buses 
happened to prime numbers. (But, of course, we can’t say: the 
numbers 17, 3, 5, 31 happen to be prime numbers” any more than 
“the number 3 happens to be a prime number”), “By chance”’ is 
indeed the opposite of “in accordance with a general rule’’, but 
however odd it sounds one can say that the proposition “17, 3, 5, 31 
are prime numbers”’ is derivable by a general rule just like the 
proposition 2+ 3 = 5. 


456 


If we now return to the first proposition, we may ask again: 
How is the proposition “all numbers have the property «” 
supposed to be meant ? How is one supposed to be able to know? 
For to settle its sense you must settle that too! The expression “by 
chance”’ indicates a verification by successive tests, and that is 
contradicted by the fact that we are not speaking of a finite series 
of numbers. 


In mathematics description and object are equivalent. “The 
fifth number of the number series has these properties” says she 
same as ““s has these properties”. The properties of a house do not 
Jollow from its position in a row of houses; but the properties of a 
number are the properties of a position. 


You might say that the properties of a particular number cannot 
be foreseen. You can only see them when you’ve got there. 

What is general is the repetition of an operation. Each stage of 
the repetition has its own individuality. But it isn’t as if I use the 
operation to move from one individual to another so that the 
operation would be the means for getting from one to the other - 
like a vehicle stopping at every number which we can then study: 
no, applying the operation +1 three times yields and és the number 
3. 

(In the calculus process and result are equivalent to each other.) 

But before deciding to speak of “all these individualities” or 
“the totality of these individualities” I had to consider carefully 
what stipulations I wanted to make here for the use of the 
expressions “‘all” and “totality”. 


It is difficult to extricate yourself completely from the extensional 
viewpoint: You keep thinking “Yes, but there must still be an 
internal relation between x? + y? and z} since at least extensions 
of these expressions if I only knew them would have to show the 
result of such a relation’’. Or perhaps: “It must surely be either 
essential to all nambets to have the property or not, even if I can’t 
know it.” 


457 


“Tf I run through the number series, I either eventually come to 
a number with the property < or I never do.” The expression “to 
run through the number series’ is nonsense; unless a sense is 
given to it which removes the suggested analogy with “running 
through the numbers from 1 to 100”, 


When Brouwer attacks the application of the law of excluded 
middle in mathematics, he is right in so far as he is directing his 
attack against a process analogous to the proof of empirical 
propositions. In mathematics you can never prove something like 
this: 1 saw two apples lying on the table, and now there is only ene 
there, so A has eaten an apple. That is, you can’t by excluding 
certain possibilities prove a new one which isn’t already contained 
in the exclusion because of the rules we have laid down. To that 
extent there are no genuine alternatives in mathematics. If mathe- 
matics was the investigation of empirically given aggregates, one 
could use the exclusion of a part to describe what was not excluded, 
and in that case the non-excluded part would not be equivalent to 
the exclusion of the others. 


The whole approach that if a proposition is valid for one region 
of mathematics it need not necessarily be valid for a second region 
as well, is quite out of place in mathematics, completely contrary 
to its essence. Although many authors hold just this approach to 
be particularly subtle and to combat prejudice. 


It is only if you investigate the relevant propositions and their 
proofs that you can recognize the nature of the generality of the 
propositions of mathematics that treat not of “all cardinal numbers” 
but e.g. of “all real numbers”. 


How a proposition is verified is what it says. Compare generality 
in arithmetic with the generality of non-arithmetical propositions. 


458 


It is differently verified and so is of a different kind. The verification 
is not a mere token of the truth, but determines the sense of the 
proposition. (Einstein: how a magnitude is measured is what it is.)

On set theory 


A misleading picture: “The rational points lie close together 
on the number-line.”’ 


Is a space thinkable that contains all rational points, but not 
the irrational ones? Would this structure be too coarse for our 
space, since it would mean that we could only reach the irrational 
points approximately? Would it mean that our net was not fine 
enough? No. What we would lack would be the laws, not 
the extensions. 


Is a space thinkable that contains all rational points but not the 
irrational ones ? 

That only means: don’t the rational numbers set a precedent for 
the irrational numbers ? 

No more than draughts sets a precedent for chess. 

There isn’t any gap left open by the rational numbers that is 
filled up by the irrationals. 


We are surprised to find that “between the everywhere dense 
rational points”, there is still room for the irrationals. (What 
balderdash!) What does a construction like that for /2 show? 
Does it show how there is yet room for this point in between all 
the rational points? It shows that the point yze/ded by the con- 
struction, yielded by ¢bis construction, is not rational. - And what 
corresponds to this construction in arithmetic? A sort of number 
which manages after a//to squeeze in between the rational numbers ? 
A law that is not a law of the nature of a rational number. 


The explanation of the Dedekind cut pretends to be clear when it 
says: there are 3 cases: either the class R has a first member and L 
no last member, etc. In fact two of these 3 cases cannot be imagined, 
unless the words “class”, “first member’’, “last member”, al- 
together change the everyday meanings thay are supposed to have 
retained.

That is, if someone is dumbfounded by our talk of a class of 
points that lie to the right of a given point and have no beginning, 
and says: give us an example of such a class — we trot out the class 
of rational numbers; but that isn’t a class of points in the original 
sense. 


The point of intersection of two curves isn’t the common mem- 
ber of two classes of points, it’s the meeting of two laws. Unless, 


very misleadingly, we use the second form of expression to define 
the first. 


After all I have already said, it may sound trivial if I now say 
that the mistake in the set-theoretical approach consists time and 
again in treating laws and enumerations (lists) as essentially the 
same kind of thing and arranging them in parallel series so that one 
fills in gaps left by another. 


The symbol for a class is a list. 


Here again, the difficulty arises from the formation of mathemati- 
cal pseudo-concepts. For instance, when we say that we can arrange 
the cardinal numbers, but not the rational numbers, in a series 
according to their size, we are unconsciously presupposing that the 
concept of an ordering by size does have a sense for rational num- 
bers, and that it turned out on investigation that the ordering was 
impossible (which presupposes that the attempt is thinkable). — 
Thus one thinks that it is possible to attempt to arrange she real 
numbers (as if that were a concept of the same kind as ‘apple on this 
table’) in a series, and now it turned out to be impracticable. 


For its form of expression the calculus of sets relies as far as 
possible on the form of expression of the calculus of cardinal 
numbers. In some ways that is instructive, since it indicates certain 
formal similarities, but it is also misleading, like calling something 
a knife that has neither blade nor handle. (Lichtenberg.)

(The only point there can be to elegance in a mathematical proof 
is to reveal certain analogies in a particularly striking manner, 
when that is what is wanted; otherwise it is a product of stupidity 
and its only effect is to obscure what ought to be clear and manifest. 
The stupid pursuit of elegance is a principal cause of the mathe- 
maticians’ failure to understand their own operations; or perhaps 
the lack of understanding and the pursuit of elegance have a 
common origin.) 


Human beings are entangled all unknowing in the net of 
language. 


“There is a point where the two curves intersect.”” How do you 
know that? If you tell me, I will know what sort of sense the 
proposition “there is...” has. 


If you want to know what the expression “the maximum of a 
curve” means, ask yourself: how does one find it? — If something 
is found in a different way it is a different thing. We define the 
maximum as the point on the curve higher than all the others, and 
from that we get the idea that it is only our human weakness that 
prevents us from sifting through the points of the curve one by 
one and selecting the highest of them. And this leads to the idea 
that the highest point among a finite number of points is essentially 
the same as the highest point of a curve, and that we are simply 
finding out the same thing by two different methods, just as we 
find out in two different ways that there is no one in the next room; 
one way if the door is shut and we aren’t strong enough to open it, 
and another way if we can get inside. But, as I said, it isn’t human 
weakness that’s in question where the alleged description of the 
action “that we cannot perform” is senseless. Of course it does no 
harm, indeed it’s very interesting, to see the analogy between the 
maximum of a curve and the maximum (in another sense) of a class 
of points, provided that the analogy doesn’t instil the prejudice 
that in each case we have fundamentally the same thing. 


462 


It’s the same defect in our syntax which presents the geometrical 
proposition “a length may be divided by a point into two parts” 
as a proposition of the same form as “‘a length may be divided for 
ever’’; so that it looks as if in both cases we can say “Let’s suppose 
the possible division to have been carried out”. “Divisible into 
two parts” and “infinitely divisible”’ have quite different grammars. 
We mistakenly treat the word “‘infinite’’ as if it were a number 
word, because in everyday speech both are given as answers to the 
questfon “Show many?” 


“But after all the maximum is higher than any other arbitrary 
points of the curve.” But the curve is not composed of points, it is 
a law that points obey, or again, a law according to which points 
can be constructed. If you now ask: “which points?” I can only 
say, “well, for instance, the points P, Q, R, etc.”’ On the one hand 
we can’t give a number of points and say that they are all the points 
that lie on the curve, and on the other hand we can’t speak of a 
totality of points as something describable which although we 
humans cannot count them might be called the totality of all the 
points of the curve — a totality too big for us human beings. On the 
one hand there is a law, and on the other points on the curve; — but 
not “‘a// the points of the curve”. The maximum is higher than any 
point of the curve that happens to be constructed, but it isn’t 
higher than a totality of points, unless the criterion for that, and 
thus the sense of the assertion, is once again simply construction 
according to the law of the curve. 


Of course the web of errors in this region is a very complicated 
one. There is also e.g. the confusion between two different mean- 
ings of the word “kind’”’. We admit, that is, that the infinite num- 
bers are a different ind of number from the finite ones, but then we 
misunderstand what the difference between different kinds amounts 
to in this case. We don’t realise, that is, that it’s not a matter of 
distinguishing between objects by their properties in the way we 
distinguish between red and yellow apples, but a matter of differ- 
ent logical forms. —- Thus Dedekind tried to describe an infinite class 


463 


by saying that it is a class which is similar to a proper subclass of 
itself. Here it looks as if he has given a property that a class must 
have in order to fall under the concept “‘infinite class’’ (Frege).! 
Now let us consider how this definition is applied. I am to investi- 
gate in a particular case whether a class is finite or not, whether a 
certain row of trees, say, is finite or infinite. So, in accordance with 
the definition, I take a subclass of the row of trees and investigate 
whether it is similar (i.e. can be co-ordinated one-to-one) to the 
whole class! (Here already the whole thing has become laughable.) 
It hasn’t any meaning; for, if I take a “finite class’’ as a sub-class, the 
attempt to coordinate it one-to-one with the whole class must eo ¢pso 
fail: and if I make the attempt with an infinite class — but already that 
is a piece of nonsense, for if it is infinite, I cannot make an attempt 
to co-ordinate it. — What we call ‘correlation of all the members of 
a class with others’ in the case of a finite class is something quite 
different from what we, e.g., call a correlation of all cardinal 
numbers with all rational numbers. The two correlations, or what 
one means by these words in the two cases, belong to different 
logical types. An infinite class is not a class which contains more 
members than a finite one, in the ordinary sense of the word 
“more”. If we say that an infinite number is greater than a finite 
one, that doesn’t make the two comparable, because in that 
statement the word “greater”’ hasn’t the same meaning as it has say in 
the proposition 5 > 4! 


That is to say, the definition pretends that whether a class is 
finite or infinite follows from the success or failure of the attempt 
to correlate a proper subclass with the whole class; whereas there 
just isn’t any such decision procedure. — ‘Infinite class’ and “finite 
class’ are different logical categories; what can be significantly 


1. Cf. The Foundations of Arithmetic, §84. (Ed.) 


464 


asserted of the one category cannot be significantly asserted of the 
other. 


With regard to finite classes the proposition that a class is not 
similar to its sub-classes is not a truth but a tautology. It is the 
grammatical rules for the generality of the general implication in 
the proposition “‘k is a subclass of K” that contain what is said by 
the proposition that K is an infinite class. 


A proposition like “there is no last cardinal number” is offensive 
to naive — and correct —- common sense. If I ask ““Who was the last 
person in the procession ?’’ and am told ‘“There wasn’t a last 
person” I don’t know what to think; what does “There wasn’t a 
last person’”’ mean? Of course, if the question had been “Who was 
the standard bearer ?”’ I would have understood the answer “There 
wasn’t a standard bearer’’; and of course the bewildering answer is 
modelled on an answer of that kind. That is, we feel, correctly, that 
where we can speak at all of a last one, there can’t be ‘‘No last one’’. 
But of course that means: The proposition “There isn’t a last one”’ 
should rather be: it makes no sense to speak of a “last cardinal 
number”’, that expression is ill-formed. 


“Does the procession have am end?” might also mean: is the 
procession a compact group? And now someone might say: 
“There, you see, you can easily imagine a case of something not 
having an end; so why can’t there be other such cases ?”’ — But the 
answer is: The “‘cases” in this sense of the word are grammatical 
cases, and it is they that determine the sense of the question. The 
question ‘Why can’t there be other such cases?’’ is modelled on: 
“Why can’t there be other minerals that shine in the dark’’; but the 
latter is about cases where a statement is true, the former about 
cases that determine the sense. 


The form of expression “m = 2n correlates a class with one of 


its proper subclasses” uses a misleading analogy to clothe a 
trivial sense in a paradoxial form. (And instead of being ashamed of 


465 


this paradoxical form as something ridiculous, people plume them- 
selves on a victory over all prejudices of the understanding). It is 
exactly as if one changed the rules of chess and said it had been 
shown that chess could also be played quite differently. Thus we 
first mistake the word “‘number” for a concept word like “apple’’, 
then we talk of a “number of numbers” and we don’t see that in 
this expression we shouldn’t use the same word “number”’ twice; 
and finally we regard it as a discovery that the number of the even 
numbers is equal to the number of the odd and even numbers. 


It is less misleading to say “m= n allows the possiblity of 
correlating every time with another” than to say ‘“‘m = zn correlates 
all numbers with others’’. But here too the grammar of the meaning 
of the expression “‘possibility of correlation” has to be learnt. 


(It’s almost unbelievable, the way in which a problem gets 
completely barricaded in by the misleading expressions which 
generation upon generation throw up for miles around it, so that it 
becomes virtually impossible to get at it.) 


If two arrows point in the same direction, isn’t it in such a case 
absurd to call these directions equally /ong, because whatever lies 
in the direction of the one arrow, also lies in that of the other? - 
The generality of m = 2n is an arrow that points along the series 
generated by the operation. And you can even say that the arrow 
points to infinity; but does that mean that there is something — 
infinity — at which it points, as at a thing? —It’s as though the 
atrow designates the possibility of a position in its direction. But 
the word “possibility” is misleading, since someone will say: let 
what is possible now become actual. And in thinking this we always 
think of a temporal process, and infer from the fact that mathe- 
matics has nothing to do with time, that in its case possibility is 
already actuality. 

The “‘infinite series of cardinal numbers” or “the concept of 
catdinal number”? is only such a possibility - as emerges clearly 


466 


from the symbol “|o, &, €+ 1|”. This symbol is itself an arrow 
with the “o” as its tail and the “& + 1” as its tip. It is possible to 
speak of things which lie in the direction of the arrow, but mis- 
leading or absurd to speak of all possible positions for things 
lying in the direction of the arrow as an equivalent for the arrow 
itself. Ifa searchlight sends out light into infinite space it illuminates 
everything in its direction, but you can’t say it illuminates infinity. 


It is always right to be extremely suspicious when proofs in 
mathematics are taken with greater generality than is warranted by 
the known application of the proof. This is always a case of the 
mistake that sees general concepts and particular cases in mathe- 
matics. In set theory we meet this suspect generality at every step. 

One always feels like saying “‘let’s get down to brass tacks”. 

These general considerations only make sense when we have a 
particular region of application in mind. 

In mathematics there isn’t any such thing as a generalization 
whose application to particular cases is still unforseeable. That’s 
why the general discussions of set theory (if they aren’t viewed as 
calculi) always sound like empty chatter, and why we are always 
astounded when we are shown an application for them. We feel 
that what is going on isn’t properly connected with real things. 


The distinction between the general truth that one can know, 
and the particular that one doesn’t know, or between the known 
description of the object, and the object itself that one hasn’t seen, 
is another example of something that has been taken over into 
logic from the physical description of the world. And that too is 
where we get the idea that our reason can recognize questions but 
not their answers. 


467 


Set theory attempts to grasp the infinite at a more general level 
than the investigation of the laws of the real numbers. It says that 
you can’t grasp the actual infinite by means of mathematical 
symbolism at all and therefore it can only be described and not 
represented. The description would encompass it in something 
like the way in which you carry a number of things that you can’t 
hold in your hand by packing them ina box. They are then invisible 
but we still know we are carrying them (so to speak, indirectly). 
One might say of this theory that it buys a pig in a poke. Let the 
infinite accommodate itself in this box as best it can. 

With this there goes too the idea that we can use language to 
describe logical forms. In a description of this sort the structures 
are presented in a package and so it does look as if one could speak 
of a structure without reproducing it in the proposition itself. 
Concepts which are packed up like this may, to be sure, be used, 
but our signs derive their meaning from definitions which package 
the concepts in this way; and if we follow up these definitions, the 
structures are uncovered again. (Cf. Russell’s definition of “R*”’.) 


When “all apples”’ are spoken of, it isn’t, so to speak, any concern 
of logic how many apples there are. With numbers it is different; 
logic is responsible for each and every one of them. 


Mathematics consists entirely of calculations. 


In mathematics everything is algorithm and nothing is meaning; 
even when it doesn’t look like that because we seem to be using 
words to talk about mathematical things. Even these words are used 
to construct an algorithm. 


In set theory what is calculus must be separated off from what 
attempts to be (and of course cannot be) theory. The rules of the 
game have to be separated off from inessential statements about the 
chessmen.

Frege replaced the signs with new words to show the definition 
wasn’t really a definition.’ Similarly in the whole of mathematics 
one might replace the usual words, especially the word “infinite” 
and its cognates, with entirely new and hitherto meaningless 
expressions so as to see what the calculus with these signs really 
achieves and what it fails to achieve. If the idea was widespread 
that chess gave us information about kings and castles, I would 
propose to give the pieces new shapes and different names, so as to 
demonstrate that everything belonging to chess has to be contained 
in the rules. 


What a geometrical proposition means, what kind of generality 
it has, is something that must show itself when we see how it is 
applied. For even if someone succeeded in meaning something 
intangible by it it wouldn’t help him, because he can only apply it 
in a way which is quite open and intelligible to every one. 

Similarly, if someone imagined the chess king as something 
mystical it wouldn’t worry us since he can only move him on the 
8 X 8 squares of the chess board. 


We have a feeling “There can’t be possibility and actuality in 
mathematics. It’s all on ove level. And is in a certain sense, actual. ~ 
And that is correct. For mathematics is a calculus; and the calculus 
does not say of any sign that it is merely possib/e, but is concerned 
only with the signs with which it acfwally operates. (Compare the 
foundations of set theory with the assumption of a possibie 
calculus with infinite signs). 


When set theory appeals to the human impossibility of a direct 
symbolisation of the infinite it brings in the crudest imaginable 
misinterpretation of its own calculus. It is of course this very 
misinterpretation that is responsible for the invention of the 
calculus. But of course that doesn’t show the calculus in itself to

be something incorrect (it would be at worst uninteresting) and it 
is odd to believe that this part of mathematics is imperilled by any 
kind of philosophical (or mathematical) investigations. (As well 
say that chess might be imperrilled by the dicovery that wars 
between two armies do not follow the same course as battles on the 
chessboard.) What set theory has to lose is rather the atmosphere of 
clouds of thought surrounding the bare calculus, the suggestion 
of an underlying imaginary symbolism, a symbolism which isn’t 
employed in its calculus, the apparent description of which is 
really nonsense. (In mathematics anything can be imagined, except 
for a part of our calculus.) 


470

The extensional conception of the real numbers 


Like the enigma of time for Augustine, the enigma of the 
continuum arises because language misleads us into applying to it 
a picture that doesn’t fit. Set theory preserves the inappropriate 
picture of something discontinuous, but makes statements about 
it that contradict the picture, under the impression that it is 
breaking with prejudices; whereas what should really have been 
done is to point out that the picture just doesn’t fit, that it certainly 
can’t be stretched without being torn, and that instead of it one 
can use a new picture in certain respects similar to the old one. 


The confusion in the concept of the “actual infinite” arises from 
the unclear concept of irrational number, that is, from the fact that 
logically very different things are called “‘irrational numbers” 
without any clear limits being given to the concept. The illusion 
that we have a firm concept rests on our belief that in signs of the 
the form “o.abcd...ad infinitum’ we have a pattern to which 
they (the irrational numbers) have to conform whatever happens. 


“Suppose I cut a length at a place where there is no rational 
point (no rational number).”’ But can you do that? What sort of a 
length are you speaking of? “But if my measuring instruments 
were fine enough, at least I could approximate without limit to a 
certain point by continued bisection’’! — No, for I could never tell 
whether my point was a point of this kind. All I could tell would 
always be that I hadn’t reached it. “But if I carry out the construc- 
tion of V2 with absolutely exact drawing instruments, and then 
by bisection approximate to the point I get, I Avow that this process 
will never reach the constructed point.” But it would be odd if one 
construction could as it were prescribe something to the others in 
this way! And indeed that isn’t the way it is. It is very possible that 


471 


the point I get by means of the ‘exact’ construction of 4/2 is 
reached by the bisection after say 100 steps; — but in that case we 
could say: our space is not Euclidean. 


The “‘cut at the irrational point”’ is a picture, and a misleading 
picture. 


A cut is a principle of division into greater and smaller. 


Does a cut through a length determine in advance the results of 
all bisections meant to approach the point of the cut? No. 


In the previous example! in which I threw dice to guide me in 
the successive reduction of an interval by the bisection of a length 
I might just as well have thrown dice to guide me in the writing of 
a decimal. Thus the description ‘endless process of choosing 
between 1 and 0” does not determine a law in the writing of a 
decimal. Perhaps you feel like saying: the prescription for the end- 
less choice between o and 1 in this case could be reproduced by a 
symbol like “‘o $9... ad. inf.”. But if I adumbrate a law thus 
“o-oo1001001 ... ad inf.”, what I want to show is not the finite 
section of the series as a specimen of the infinite series, but rather 
the kind of regularity to be perceived in it. But in “o, {??...ad. inf.” 
I don’t perceive any law, — on the contrary, precisely that a law is 


absent. 


(What criterion is there for the irrational numbers being com- 
plete? Let us look at an irrational number: it runs through a series 
of rational approximations. When does it leave this series behind ? 
Never. But then, the series also never comes to an end. 

Suppose we had the totality of all irrational numbers with one 
single exception. How would we feel the lack of this one ? And — if 


1. See below, p. 484 


472 


it were to be added — how would it fill the gap? Suppose that it’s 
x. If an irrational number is given through the totality of its 
approximations, then up to amy point taken at random there is a 
series coinciding with that of x. Admittedly for each such series 
there is a point where they diverge. But this point can lie arbitrarily 
far ‘out’, so that for any series agreeing with 7 I can find one agree- 
ing with it still further. And so if I have the totality of all irrational 
numbers except 7, and now insert x I cannot cite a point at which 
x is now really needed. At every point it has a companion agreeing 
with it from the beginning on. 

To the question “how would we feel the lack of x” our answer 
must be “ifm were an extension, we would never feel the lack of it’. 
i.e. it would be impossible for us to observe a gap that it filled. But 
if someone asked us ‘But have you then an infinite decimal 
expansion with the figure m in the r-th place and n in the s-th place, 
etc?’ we could always oblige him.) 


“The decimal fractions developed in accordance with a law still 
need supplementing by an infinite set of irregular infinite decimal 
fractions that would be ‘brushed under the carpet’ if we were to 
restrict ourselves to those generated by a law.”’ Where is there such an 


infinite decimal that is generated by no law? And how would 
we notice that it was missing ? Where is the gap it is needed to fill? 


What is it like if someone so to speak checks the various laws 
for the construction of binary fractions by means of the set of 
finite combinations of the numerals o and 1?— The results of a 
law run through the finite combinations and hence the laws are 
complete as far as their extensions are concerned, once a// the finite 
combinations have been gone through. 


If one says: two laws are identical in the case where they yield 


the same result at every stage, this looks like a quite general rule. 
But in reality the proposition has different senses depending on 


473 


what is the criterion for their yielding the same result at every 
stage. (For of course there’s no such thing as the supposed generally 
applicable method of infinite checking!) Thus under a mode of 
speaking derived from an analogy we conceal the most various 
meanings, and then believe that we have united the most various 
cases into a single system. 


(The laws corresponding to the irrational numbers all belong 
to the same type to the extent that they must all ultimately be 
recipes for the successive construction of decimal fractions. In a 
certain sense the common decimal notation gives rise toa common 
type.) 

We could also put it thus: every point in a length can be approxi- 
mated to by rational numbers by repeated bisection. There is no 
point that can only be approximated to by irrational steps of a 
specified type. Of course, that is only a way of clothing in different 
words the explanation that by irrational numbers we mean endless 
decimal fractions; and that explanation in turn is only a rough 
explanation of the decimal notation, plus perhaps an indication 
that we distinguish between laws that yield recurring decimals and 
laws that don’t. 


The incorrect idea of the word “infinite” and of the role of 
“infinite expansion” in the arithmetic of the real numbers gives us 
the false notion that there is a uniform notation for irrational 
numbers (the notation of the infinite extension, e.g. of infinite 
decimal fractions). 

The proof that for every pair of cardinal numbers x and y G #2 
does not correlate V2 with a single type of number — called “the 
irrational numbers”, It is not as if this type of number was construc- 
ted before I construct it; in other words, I don’t know any more 
about this new type of number than J tell myself.

n’ isa rule for the formation of decimal fractions: the expansion 
of x’ is the same as the expansion of r except where the sequence 
777 occurs in the expansion of 7; in that case instead of the 
sequence 777 there occurs the sequence 000. There is no 
method known to our calculus of discovering where we en- 
counter such a sequence in the expansion of x. 

P isa rule for the construction of binary fractions. At the nth 
place of the expansion there occurs a 1 or a o according to 
whether n is prime or not. 

F  isarule for the construction of binary fractions. At the nth place 
there is a o unless a triple x, y, z from the first 100 cardinal 
numbers satisfies the equation x" + y" = z". 


’ Tm tempted to say, the individual digits of the expansion (of x 
for example) are always only the results, the bark of the fully 
grown tree. What counts, or what something new can still grow 
from, is the inside of the trunk, where the tree’s vital energy is. 
Altering the surface doesn’t change the tree at all. To change it, 
you have to penetrate the trunk which is still living. 


I call ‘‘x,”’ the expansion of x up to the nth place. Then I can 
say: I understand what x’,)) means, but not what nr’ means, since 
t has no places, and I can’t substitute others for none. It would be 


53 
different if I e.g. defined the division a/b as a rule for the formation 
of decimals by division and the replacements of every 5 in the 
quotient by a 3. In this case I am acquainted, for instance, with the 


number : iy. — And if our calculus contains a method, a law, to 
calculate the position of 777 in the expansion of 7, then the law of 
zm includes a mention of 777 and the law can be altered by the 
substitution of ooo for 777. But in that case x’ isn’t the same as what 


475 


I defined above; it has a different grammar from the one I supposed. 
In our calculus there is no question whether x 57’ or not, no such 
equation or inequality. m’ is not comparable with x. And one 
can’t say “‘not yet comparable”, because if at some time I construct 
something similar to 7’ that is comparable to x, then for that very 
reason it will no longer be x’. For x’ like x is a way of denoting a 
game, and I cannot say that draughts is not yet played with as many 
pieces as chess, on the grounds that it might develop into a game 
with 16 pieces. In that case it will no longer be what we call 
“draughts” (unless by this word I mean not a game, but a charac- 
teristic of several games or something similar; and this rider can 
be applied to x and x’ too). But since being comparable with other 
numbers is a fundamental characteristic of a number, the question 
arises whether one is to call x’ a number, and a real number; but 
whatever it is ca//ed the essential thing is that x’ is not a number in 
the same sense as 7. I can also call an interval a point and on 
occasion it may even be practical to do so; but does it become more 
like a point if I forget that I have used the word “point” with two 
different meanings ? 

Here it is clear that the possibility of the decimal expansion does 
not make 7’ a number in the same sense as 7. Of course the rule 
for this expansion is unambiguous, as unambiguous as that for 
n or V2; but that is no proof that x’ is a real number, if one takes 
comparability with rational numbers as an essential mark of real 
numbers. One can indeed abstract from the distinction between the 
rational and irrational numbers, but that does not make the 
distinction disappear. Of coutse, the fact that x’ is an unambiguous 
rule for decimal fractions naturally signifies a similarity between 
n’ and x or V2; but equally an interval has a similarity with a 
point etc. All the errors that have been made in this chapter of the 
philosophy of mathematics are based on the confusion between 
internal properties of a form (a rule as one among a list of rules) 
and what we call “properties” in everyday life (red as a property 


476 


of this book). We might also say: the contradictions and unclarities 
are brought about by people using a single word, e.g. “number”, to 
mean at one time a definite set of rules, and at another time a 
variable set, like meaning by “chess” on one occasion the definite 


game we play today, and on another occasion the substratum of a 
particular historical development. 


“How far must I expand x in order to have some acquaintance 
with it?” — Of course that is nonsense. We are already acquainted 
with it without expanding it at all. And in the same sense I might 
say that I am not acquainted with 7’ at all. Hete it is quite clear 
that 7’ belongs to a different system from 7; that is something we 
recognize if we keep our eyes on the nature of the laws instead of 
comparing “the expansions” of both. 


Two mathematical forms, of which one but not the other can be 
compared in my calculus with every rational number, are not 


~ numbers in the same sense of the word. The comparison of a num- 


ber to a point on the number-line is valid only if we can say for 
every two numbers a and b whether a is to the right of b or b to the 
right of a. 

It is not enough that someone should — supposedly — determine 
a point ever more closely by narrowing down its whereabouts. We 
must be able to construct ¢. To be sure, continued throwing of a 
die indefinitely restricts the possible whereabouts of a point, but it 
doesn’t determine a point. After every throw (or every choice) the 
point is still infinitely indeterminate — or, more correctly, after 
every throw it is infinitely indeterminate. I think that we are here 
misled by the absolute size of the objects in our visual field; and on 
the other hand, by the ambiguity of the expression “ to approach a 
point”’. We can say of a line in the visual field that by shrinking 
it is approximating more and more to a point — that is, it is be- 
coming more and more similar to a point. On the other hand when 
a Euclidean line shrinks it does sot become any more like a point; 
it always remains totally dissimilar, since its length, so to say, 


never gets anywhere near a point. If we say of a Euclidean line that 
it is approximating to a point by shrinking, that only makes sense 
if there is an already designated point which its ends are approach- 
ing; it cannot mean that by shrinking it produces a point. To ap- 
proach a point has two meanings: in one case it means to come 
spatially nearer to it, and in that case the point must already be 
there, because in this sense I cannot approach a man who doesn’t 
exist; in the other case, it means “to become more like a point’’, 
as we say for instance that the apes as they developed approached 
the stage of being human, their development produced human 


beings. 


To say “two real numbers are identical if their expansions 
coincide in a// places” only has sense in the case in which, by 
producing a method of establishing the coincidence, I have given 
a sense to the expression “to coincide in all places”, And the same 
naturally holds for the proposition “they do not coincide if they 
disagree in amy one place”’. 


But conversely couldn’t one treat x’ as the original, and there- 
fore as the first assumed point, and then be in doubt about the 
justification of 7? As far as concerns their extension, they are natu- 
rally on the same level; but what causes us to call x a point on the 
number-line is its comparability with the rational numbers. 


If I view 7, or let’s say V2, as a tule for the construction of 
decimals, I can naturally produce a modification of this rule by 
saying that every 7 in the development of V 2 is to be replaced by 
a 5; but this modification is of quite a different nature from one 
which is produced by an alteration of the radicant or the exponent 
of the radical sign or the like. For instance, in the modified law I 
am including a reference to the number system of the expansion 
which wasn’t in the original rule for V2. The alternation of the 
law is of a much more fundamental kind than might at first appear. 


478 


Of course, if we have the incorrect picture of the infinite extension 
before our minds, it can appear as if appending the substitution rule 


7->5 to V2 alters it much less than altering V2 into V2-1, because 
7-5 


the expansions of ‘ V2 are very similar to those of V2, whereas the 
expansion of V/2-1 deviates from that of V’2 from the second place 
onwards. 


Suppose I give a rule o for the formation of extensions in such a 
way that my calculus knows no way of predicting what is the 
maximum number of times an apparently recurring stretch of the 
extension can be repeated. That differs from a real number because 
in certain cases I can’t compare p — a witha rational number, so that 
the expression p — a = b becomes nonsensical. If for instance the 
expansion of p so far known to me is 3:14 followed by an open 
series of ones (3°1411 11 ...), it wouldn’t be possible to say of the 
difference p —3-14i whether it was greater or less than 0; so in this 
sense it can’t be compared with o or with a point on the number 
axis and it and ¢ can’t be called number in the same sense as one of 
these points. 


|The extension of a concept of number, or of the concept ‘all’, 
etc. seems quite harmless to us; but it stops being harmless as 
soon as we forget that we have in fact changed our concept.| 


|So far as concerns the irrational numbers, my investigation 
says only that it is incorrect (or misleading) to speak of irrational 
numbers in such a way as to contrast them with cardinal numbers 
and rational numbers as a different kind of number; because what 
are called “irrational numbers” are species of number that are 
really different—as different from each other as the rational 
numbers are different from each of them.| 


“Can God know all the places of the expansion of 7?” would 
have been a good question for the schoolmen to ask. 


479 


In these discussions we are always meeting something that could 
be called an “arithmetical experiment”. Admittedly the data deter- 
mine the result, but I can’t see 7m what way they determine it. 
That is how it is with the occurrences of the 7s in the expansion of 
m; the primes likewise are yielded as the result of an experiment. 
I can ascertain that 31 is a prime number, but I do not see the 
connection between it (its position in the series of cardinal num- 
bers) and the condition it satisfies. - But this perplexity is only the 
consequence of an incorrect expression. The connection that I 
think I do not see does not exist. There is not an—as it were 
irregular — occurrence of 7s in the expansion of x, because there 
isn’t any series that is called the expansion of x. There are expan- 
sions of x, namely those that have been worked out (perhaps 1000) 
and in those the 7s don’t occur “irregularly” because their occur- 
rence can be described. (The same goes for the “distribution of the 
primes”. If you give as a law for this distribution, you give us a 
new number series, vew numbers.) (A law of the calculus that I do 
not know is not a law). (Only what I see is a law; not what I des- 
cribe. That is the only thing standing in the way of my expressing 
more in my signs that I can understand.) 


Does it make no sense to say, even after Fermat’s last theorem 
has been proved, that F = 0-11? (If, say I were to read about it 
in the papers.) I will indeed then say, “so now we can write 
F=or11’.” That is, it is tempting to adopt the sign “F” from the 
earlier calculus, in which it didn’t denote a rational number, into 
the new one and now to denote o-11 with it. 


F was supposed to be a number of which we did not know 
whether it was rational or irrational. Imagine a number, of which 
we do not know whether it is a cardinal number or a rational 
number. A description in the calculus is worth just as much as this 
particular set of words and it has nothing to do with an object 
given by description which may someday be found. 


480 


What I mean could also be expressed in the words: one cannot 
discover any connection between parts of mathematics or logic 
that was already there without one knowing. 


In mathematics there is no “not yet” and no “until further 
notice” (except in the sense in which we can say that we haven’t 
yet multiplied two 1000 digit numbers together.) 


“Does the operation yield a rational number for instance ?” - 
How can that be asked, if we have no method for deciding the 
question ? For it is only in an established calculus that the operation 
yields results. 1 mean: “yields” is essentially timeless. It doesn’t 
mean “yields, given time’’ — but: yields in accordance to the rules 
already known and established. 


“The position of all primes must somehow be predetermined. 
We work them out only successively, but they are all already 
determined. God, as it were, knows them all. And yet for all that 
it seems possible that they are not determined by a law.” — Always 
this picture of the meaning of a word as a full box which is given 
us with its contents packed in it all ready for us to investigate. — 
What do we know about the prime numbers? How is the con- 
cept of them given to us at all? Don’t we ourselves make the 
decisions about them? And how odd that we assume that there 
must have been decisions taken about them that we haven’t taken 
ourselves! But the mistake is understandable. For we use the 
expression “‘prime number” and it sounds similar to “cardinal 
number’, “square number’’, “even number” etc. So we think it 
will be used in the same way, and we forget that for the expression 
“‘prime number” we have given quite different rules — rules differ- 
ent in kind — and we find ourselves at odds with ourselves in a 
strange way. — But how is that possible? After all the prime num- 
bers are familiar cardinal numbers — how can one say that the con- 
cept of prime number is not a number concept in the same sense 
as the concept of cardinal number? But here again we are tricked 
by the image of an “infinite extension” as an analogue to the 
familiar ‘‘finite extension. Of course the concept ‘prime number’ 


481 


is defined by means of the concept ‘cardinal number’, but “the 
ptime numbers” aren’t defined by means of “the cardinal cubed 
and the way we derived the concept ‘prime number’ from the 
concept ‘cardinal number’ is essentially different from that in 
which we derived, say, the concept ‘square number’, (So we 
cannot be surprised if it behaves differently.) One might well 
imagine an arithmetic which ~ as it were — didn’t stop at the con- 
cept ‘cardinal number’ but went straight on to that of square 
numbers. (Of course that arithmetic couldn’t be applied in thesame 

way as ours.) But then the concept “square number” wouldn’t 

have the characteristic it has in our arithmetic of being essentially 

a part-concept, with the square numbers essentially a sub-class of 
the cardinal numbers; in that case the square numbers would be a 

complete series with a complete arithmetic. And now imagine the 

same done with the prime numbers! That will make it clear that 

they are not “numbers” in the same sense as e.g. the square num- 
bets or the cardinal numbers. 


Could the calculations of an engineer yield the result that the 


Hern of a machine part in proportion to regularly increasing 
oads must increase in accordance with the series of primes ?

Irregular infinite decimals 


“Irregular infinite decimals”. We always have the idea that we 
only have to bring together the words of our everyday language 
to give the combinations a sense, and all we then have to do is to 
inquire into it— supposing it’s not quite clear right away. — 
It is as if words were ingredients of a chemical compound, and 
we shook them together to make them combine with each other, 
and then had to investigate the properties of the compound, 
If someone said he didn’t understand the expression “irregular 
infinite decimals” he would be told “that’s not true, you under- 
stand it very well: don’t you know what the words “irregular”, 
“infinite”, and “decimal” mean? — well, then, you understand 
their combination as well.” And what is meant by “understanding” 
here is that he knows how to apply these words in certain cases, 
and say connects an image with them. In fact, someone who puts these 
words together and asks “‘what does it mean” is behaving rather 
like small children who cover a paper with random scribblings, 


_ show it to grown-ups, and ask “what is that?” 


“Infinitely complicated law”, “infinitely complicated construc- 
tion” (“Human beings believe, if only they hear words, there must 
be something that can be thought with them”’). 


How does an infinitely complicated law differ from the lack of 


any law? 


(Let us not forget: mathematicians’ discussions of the infinite 
ate clearly finite discussions. By which I mean, they come to an 


end.) 


“One can imagine an irregular infinite decimal being constructed 
by endless dicing, with the number of pips in each case being a 
decimal place.” But, if the dicing goes on for ever, no final result 


ever comes out. 


483 


“It is only the human intellect that is incapable of grasping it, a 
higher intellect could do so!”” Fine, then describe to me the gram- 
mar of the expression “higher intellect”’; what can such an intellect 
gtasp and what can’t it grasp and in what cases (in experience) 
do I say that an intellect grasps something ? You will then see that 


describing grasping is itself grasping. (Compare: the solution of a 
mathematical problem.) 


Suppose we throw a coin heads and tails and divide an interval 
AB in accordance with the following rule: “Heads” means: take 
the left half and divide it in the way the next throw prescribes, 
“Tails” says “take the right half, etc.” By repeated throws I then 


A B 


t——+HH+] 


get dividing-points that move in an ever smaller interval. Does it 
amount to a description of the position of a point if I say that it is 
the one infinitely approached by the cuts as ptescribed by the 
tepeated tossing of the coin? Here one believes oneself to have 
determined a point corresponding to an irregular infinite decimal. 
But the description doesn’t determine aay point explicitly; unless 
one says that the words “point on this line” also “determine a 
point”! Here we are confusing the recipe for throwing with a 
mathematical rule like that for producing decimal places of 4/2. 
Those mathematical rules are the points. That is, you can find rela- 
tions between those rules that resemble in their grammar the 
relations “‘larger’’ and “‘smaller’’ between two lengths, and that.is 
why they are referred to by these words. The rule for working out 
places of 1/2 is itself the numeral for the irrational number; and the 
reason I here speak of a “number”? is that I can calculate with these 
signs (certain rules for the construction of rational numbers) just as 
Tcan with rational numbers themselves. If I want to say similarly 


484 


that the recipe for endless bisection according to heads and tails 
determines a point, that would have to mean that this recipe could 
be used as a numeral, i.e. in the same way as other numerals. 
But of course that is not the case. If the recipe were to correspond 
to a numeral at all, it would at best correspond to the indetermin- 
ate numeral “some’’, for all it does is to leave a number open. 
Ina word, it corresponds to nothing except the original interval.

Note in Editing 


In June 1931 Wittgenstein wrote a parenthesis in his manuscript 
book: “(My book might be called: Philosophical Grammar. This 
title would no doubt have the smell of a textbook title but that 
doesn’t matter, for behind it there is the book.) In the next four 
manuscript volumes after this he wrote nearly everything that is in 
the present work. The second of these he called “Remarks towards 
Philosophical Grammar” and the last two “Philosophical Gram- 
mar”’. 

The most important source for our text is a large typescript 
completed probably in 1933, perhaps some of it 1932. Our “Part 
Il’ makes up roughly the second half of this typescript. In most of 
the first half of it Wittgenstein made repeated changes and re- 
visions — between the lines and on the reverse sides of the typed 
sheets — and probably in the summer of 1933 he began a “Revision” 
in a manuscript volume (X and going over into XI). This, with the 
“Second Revision” (which I will explain), is the text of our Part 
I up to the Appendix. — Wittgenstein simply wrote “Umarbeitung” 
(Revision) as a heading, without a date; but he clearly wrote it in 
1933 and the early weeks of 1934. He did not write the ‘“‘second 
revision” in the manuscript volume but on large folio sheets. He 
He crossed out the text that this was to replace, and showed in 
margins which parts went where. But it is a revision of only a part, 
towards the beginning, of the first and principal “Revision”. The 
passages from the second revision are, in our text, §{§1-13 and §§23- 
43. The second revision is not dated either, but obviously it is 
later than the passages it replaces; probably not later than 1934. 

So we may take it that he wrote part of this work somewhat 
earlier, and part at the same time as his dictation of The Blue Book. 
Many things in the B/we Book are here (and they are better expressed). 
There are passages also which are in the Philosophical Remarks 
and others later included in the Investigations. It would beeasy to give 
the reference and page number for each of these. We decided not to. 
This book should be compared with Wittgenstein’s earlier and 
later writings. But this means: the method and the development 


487 


of his discussion here should be compared with the Philosophical 
Remarks and again with the Investigations. The footnotes would be 
a hindrance and, as often as not, misleading. When Wittgenstein 
writes a paragraph here that is also in the Remarks, this does not 
mean that he is just repeating what he said there. The paragraph 
may havea different importance, it may belong to the discussion ina 
different way. (We know there is more to be said on this question.) 

Wittgenstein refers to “my book” at various times in his manu- 
scripts from the start of 1929 until the latest passages of the 
Investigations. It is what his writing was to produce. The first 
attempt to form the material into a book was the typescript vol- 
ume he made in the summer of 1930 —the Philosophical Remarks 
(published in German in 1964). The large typescript of 1933 — the 
one we mentioned as a source of this volume — looks like a book. 
Everyone who sees it first thinks it is. But it is unfinished; in a 
great many ways. And Wittgenstein evidently looked on it as one 
stage in the ordering of his material. (Cf. the simile of arranging 
books on the shelves of a library, in Béve Book P- 44-45.) 

Most of the passages which make up the text of the 1933 type- 
script (called “213” in the catalogue) he had written in manuscript 
volumes between July 1930 and July 1932; but not in the order 
they have in the typescript. From the manuscript volumes he 
dictated two typescripts, one fairly short and the other much 
longer — about 850 pages together. There was already a typescript 
made from manuscripts written before July 1930 — not the type- 
script which was the Philosophical Remarks but a typescript which 
he cut into parts and sifted and put together in a different way to 
make the Philosophical Remarks. He now used an intact copy of this 
typescript together with the two later ones in the same way, 
cutting them into strips: small strips sometimes with just one 
paragraph or one sentence, sometimes groups of paragraphs; and 
arranging them in the order he saw they ought to have. Groups of 
slips in their order were clipped together to form ‘chapters’, and 
he gave each chapter a title. He then brought the chapters together— 
in a definite order —- to form ‘sections’. He gave each section a 
title and arranged them also in a definite order. In this order the 
whole was finally typed. - Later he made a table of contents out 
of the titles of sections and chapter headings. 


488 


Certain chapters, especially, leave one feeling that he cannot 
have thought the typing of the consecutive copy had finished the 
work barring clerical details. He now wrote, over and over again, 
between the lines of typescript or in the margin: “Does not belong 
here’’, “Belongs on page... above”, “Belongs to ‘Meaning’, 
§ 9”, “Goes with ‘What is an empirical proposition?’ ”, “Belongs 
with §14, p. 58 or § 89 p. 414”, and so on. But more than this, 
about 350 pages — most of the first half of the typescript — are so 
written over with changes, additions, cancellations, questions and 
new versions, that no one could ever find the ‘correct’ text here 
and copy it — saving the author himself should write it over to 
include newer versions and make everything shorter. 

He now makes no division into chapters and sections. He has 
left out paragraph numbers and any suggestion of a table of con- 
tents. We do not know why. (We do not find chapters or tables of 
contents anywhere else in Wittgenstein’s writings. He may have 
found disadvantages in the experiment he tried here.) — The extra 
spaces between paragraphs and groups of paragraphs are his own; 
and he thought these important. He would have numbered 
paragraphs, probably, as he did in the Investigations. But the 
numbers in Part I here are the editor’s, not Wittgenstein’s. Neither 
is the division in chapters Wittgenstein’s, nor the table of con- 
tents. - On the other hand, Part II has kept the chapters and the 
table of contents which Wittgenstein gave this part of the type- 
script. Perhaps this makes it look as though Part I and Part I were 
not one work. But we could not make them uniform in this 
(division and arrangement of chapters) without moving away from 
Wittgenstein’s way of presenting what he wrote. Anyone who 
reads both parts will see connections. 

And the appendix may make it plainer. Appendices 5, 6, 7, 8 
and the first half of 4 are chapters of ‘typescript 213’. Appendix 
1, Fact and Complex, is also an appendix in Philosophical Remarks. 
But Wittgenstein had fastened it together with appendices 2 and 3 
and given them a consecutive paging as one essay; with what 
intention we do not know. Each one of the eight appendices here 
discusses something connected with ‘proposition’ and with 
‘sense of a proposition’. The whole standpoint is somewhat 
earlier (the manuscripts often bear earlier dates) than that of 


489 


Part I here, but later than the Philosophical Remarks. — But the 
appendices also discuss questions directly connected with the 
themes of ‘generality’ and ‘logical inference’ in Part II. 

Part I is concerned with the generality of certain expressions or 
concepts, such as ‘language’, ‘proposition’ and ‘number’. For 
instance, § 70, page 113: 

“Compare the concept of proposition with the concept ‘number’ 
and then on the other hand with the concept of cardinal number. 
We count as numbers cardinal numbers, rational numbers 
irrational numbers, complex numbers; whether we call pile: 
constructions numbers because of their similarities with these, or 
draw a definitive boundary here or elsewhere, depends on ne: 
In this respect the concept of number is like the concept of propo- 
sition. On the other hand the concept of cardinal number |1, & 
+ 1| can be called a rigorously circumscribed concept, that’s ‘6 
say it’s a concept in a different sense of the word.” 

This discussion is closely related to the chapter on ‘Kinds of 
Cardinal Numbers’ and on ‘2+2= 4’ in Part II; and with the 


a on Inductive Proof. These are the most important things in 
art I.

Translator’s Note 


Many passages in the Philosophical Grammar appear also in the 
Philosophical Remarks, the Philosophical Investigations, and the 
Zettel. In these cases I have used the translations of Mr Roger 
White and Professor G. E. M. Anscombe, so that variations be- 
tween the styles of translators should not be mistaken for changes 
of mind on Wittgenstein’s part. Rare departures from this practice 
are marked in footnotes. Passages from the Philosophical Grammar 
appear also in The Principles of Linguistic Philosophy of F. Waismann 
(Macmillan 1965): in these cases I have not felt obliged to follow 
the English text verbatim, but I am indebted to Waismann’s 
translator. 

Three words or groups of words constantly presented difficul- 
ties in translation. 

The German word “Safz” may be translated “proposition” or 
“sentence” or (in mathematical and logical contexts) “theorem”. 
I have tried to follow what appears to have been Wittgenstein’s 
own practice when writing English, by using the word “propo- 
sition” when the syntactical or semantic properties of sentences 
were in question, and the word “‘sentence” when it was a matter of 
the physical properties of sounds or marks. But it would be idle 
to pretend that this rule provides a clear decision in every case, 
and sometimes I have been obliged to draw attention in footnotes 
to problems presented by the German word. 

From the Tractatus onward Wittgenstein frequently compared a 
proposition to a Mafstab. The German word means a rule or 
measuring rod: when Wittgenstein used it is clear that he had in 
mind a rigid object with calibrations. Finding the word “rule” too 
ambiguous, and the word “measuring-rod” too cumbersome, I 
have followed the translators of the Tractatus in using the less 
accurate but more natural word “ruler’’. 

Translators of Wittgenstein have been criticised for failing to 
adopt a uniform translation of the word “dbersehen”’ and its deriva- 
tives, given the importance of the notion of “‘gbersichtliche Dar- 
stellung” in Wittgenstein’s later conception of philosophy. I have 


491 


been unable to find a natural word to meet the requirement of 
uniformity, and have translated the word and its cognates as seemed 
natural in each context. 

Like other translators of Wittgenstein I have been forced to 
retain a rather Germanic style of punctuation to avoid departing 
too far from the original. For instance, Wittgenstein often intro- 
duced oratio recta by a colon instead of by inverted commas. This 
is not natural in English, but to change to inverted commas would 
involve making a decision — often a disputable one - about where 
the quotation is intended to end. 

I have translated the text of the Suhrkamp-Blackwell edition of 
1969 as it stands, with the exception of the passages listed below 
in which I took the opportunity to correct in translation errors of 
transcription or printing which had crept into the German text. 
The pagination of the translation, so far as practicable, matches 
that of the original edition. 

I am greatly indebted to Professor Ernst Tugendhat, who 
assisted me in the first draft of my translation; and to Mr John 
Thomas, Dr Peter Hacker, Mr Brian McGuinness, Professor 
G. E. M. Anscombe, Professor Norman Malcolm, Professor 

G. H. von Wright, Mr Roger White, Dr Anselm Miller, Mr and 
Mrs J. Tiles and Mr R. Heinaman who assisted me on particular 
points. My greatest debt is to Mr Rush Rhees, who went very 
carefully through large sections of a draft version and saved me 
from many errors while improving the translation in many ways. 
The responsibility for remaining errors is entirely mine. 

Tam grateful to the British Academy for a Visiting Fellowship 
which supported me while writing the first draft translation.
