Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the RAG pipeline code, along with explanations for each section. This pipeline uses Pinecone as a vector database and OpenAI's API to embed text. When you provide your API keys, the code will work end-to-end from embedding documents to querying them.

---

### 1. **Setting Up API Keys & Environment**

At the very top of the script, we import libraries and load our API keys from environment variables:

```python
import os
import pinecone
import openai

# Set up your API keys (ensure these are set in your environment variables or replace directly)
PINECONE_API_KEY = os.getenv("PINECONE_API_KEY")
PINECONE_ENV = os.getenv("PINECONE_ENV")  # e.g., "us-west1-gcp"
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY
```

**Explanation:**

- **`os.getenv(...)`**: This function retrieves each API key from your system's environment variables.  
- **`PINECONE_API_KEY` and `PINECONE_ENV`**: These variables are necessary for authenticating with Pinecone. Make sure you set them with your actual credentials.  
- **`openai.api_key`**: Setting this allows you to use OpenAI's API to generate embeddings.

*Before running the script, ensure that your environment variables (`PINECONE_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_ENV`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY`) are properly configured.*

### 2. **Initializing Pinecone & Setting Up the Index**

Next, the script initializes the Pinecone client and sets up an index if it doesn't already exist:

```python
# Initialize Pinecone client
pinecone.init(api_key=PINECONE_API_KEY, environment=PINECONE_ENV)

# Define index name and embedding dimension (1536 is the dimension for "text-embedding-ada-002")
index_name = "rag-index"
if index_name not in pinecone.list_indexes():
    pinecone.create_index(index_name, dimension=1536)

# Connect to the Pinecone index
index = pinecone.Index(index_name)
```

**Explanation:**

- **`pinecone.init(...)`**: This function initializes your connection with Pinecone using your API credentials.
- **Index creation:**  
  - We specify an index name, in this case, `"rag-index"`.  
  - The code checks if the index already exists. If not, it creates one with the dimension set to `1536`â€”which is the output size of the `text-embedding-ada-002` model.
- **`pinecone.Index(index_name)`**: This obtains a handle to the index so you can perform upsert (insert/update) and query operations.

---

### 3. **Embedding Text with OpenAI**

The `embed_text` function is responsible for converting text into a numerical embedding vector:

```python
def embed_text(text):
    """
    Convert a piece of text into an embedding vector using OpenAI's embedding endpoint.
    """
    response = openai.Embedding.create(
        input=[text],
        model="text-embedding-ada-002"
    )
    embedding = response["data"][0]["embedding"]
    return embedding
```

**Explanation:**

- **Embedding Call:**  
  - The function calls OpenAI's embedding API with the specified `model` (`text-embedding-ada-002`) and passes the text as an input in a list.
- **Return Value:**  
  - The API returns a response that includes the embedding vector. We extract the vector (`embedding`) and return it.
  
This vector represents the semantic meaning of the text and will later be used to measure similarity between documents.

---

### 4. **Upserting Documents into Pinecone**

The `upsert_documents` function embeds multiple documents and inserts their embeddings into the Pinecone index:

```python
def upsert_documents(documents):
    """
    Embed each document and upsert into the Pinecone index.
    
    Each vector is stored with a unique id and optional metadata.
    """
    vectors = []
    for idx, doc in enumerate(documents):
        embedding = embed_text(doc)
        meta = {"text": doc}  # you can add more metadata if needed
        vectors.append((str(idx), embedding, meta))
    index.upsert(vectors)
    print(f"Upserted {len(vectors)} documents into the index.")
```

**Explanation:**

- **Loop Through Documents:**  
  - Each document in the list is passed to `embed_text` to get its corresponding embedding.
- **Metadata:**  
  - Along with the embedding, we attach a simple metadata dictionary that contains the original text. You can later expand this with more contextual information.
- **Vector Format:**  
  - Vectors are tuples in the form `(unique_id, embedding, metadata)`. Here, we are simply using the index (converted to a string) as the unique ID.
- **`index.upsert(vectors)`**:  
  - This command writes (inserts or updates) all the vectors into the Pinecone index.
  
This step is crucial for building your vector store that will later support similarity searches.

---

### 5. **Querying the Pinecone Index**

The `query_index` function converts a query string into an embedding and retrieves the top matching documents:

```python
def query_index(query_text, top_k=5):
    """
    Convert the query text into an embedding and retrieve the top_k most similar documents.
    """
    query_embedding = embed_text(query_text)
    query_result = index.query(queries=[query_embedding], top_k=top_k, include_metadata=True)
    return query_result
```

**Explanation:**

- **Convert Query to Embedding:**  
  - The query string is converted into an embedding using the same model (`embed_text`).
- **Perform the Query:**  
  - We submit the embedding to the Pinecone index's `query` method.  
  - `top_k` specifies the number of most similar results to retrieve.
  - Setting `include_metadata=True` ensures the original document text (or any additional metadata) is returned as part of the result.
  
This method effectively finds documents whose embeddings are most similar to the provided query embedding.

---

### 6. **Main Execution Flow**

At the end of the script, there is a main block that demonstrates how to use these functions together:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example documents to upsert
    documents = [
        "Pinecone is a vector database that makes it easy to work with embeddings.",
        "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves responses by incorporating relevant documents.",
        "OpenAI provides powerful language models and embedding models like text-embedding-ada-002.",
        # Add more documents as needed...
    ]
    
    # Upsert documents into the index
    upsert_documents(documents)
    
    # Querying the index
    sample_query = "How can I use Pinecone for retrieval augmented generation?"
    results = query_index(sample_query)
    
    print("Query Results:")
    for match in results["results"][0]["matches"]:
        print(f"Score: {match['score']}, Document: {match['metadata']['text']}")
```

**Explanation:**

- **Upsert Documents:**  
  - A list of example documents is defined and passed to `upsert_documents` so that each document is embedded and stored into the Pinecone index.
- **Query Execution:**  
  - A sample query is defined, and `query_index` is used to get the top results.  
  - The results include similarity scores and metadata (the original texts).
- **Output:**  
  - The script prints the score (which indicates similarity) and the document text for each match.

### 7. **How This Fits into a RAG Pipeline**

Even though this script only handles embedding and retrieval, it forms the backbone of a full Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow:

1. **Embedding Documents:** Your documents are turned into embeddings that capture their semantic meaning.
2. **Storing in a Vector Database:** These embeddings (with metadata) are stored in Pinecone, allowing for efficient similarity searches.
3. **Retrieval on Query:** When a query is made, it's also embedded and used to find the most relevant documents from the index.
4. **Augmentation for Generation:** (Not shown here) The retrieved documents can be fed into an LLM (like GPT-3.5/4) along with the query to generate a more context-aware response.

### Final Thoughts

- **API Keys:** Make sure your keys for Pinecone and OpenAI are correctly set up in your environment.
- **Dependencies:** Ensure you have installed the required packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pinecone-client openai
  ```
- **Customization:** This is a simple example. In a production setting, you might add error handling, batching, and more detailed metadata management.

With your API keys ready, you can run this pipeline to see how documents are embedded, stored, and queried in real time. If you have any more questions or need further customization, feel free to ask!
