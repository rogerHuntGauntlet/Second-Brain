PART II 


One can imagine an animal angry, frightened, unhappy, happy, startled. But 
hopeful? And why not? 


A dog believes his master is at the door. But can he also believe his master 
will come the day after to-morrow?—And what can he not do here?—How 
do I do it?—How am I supposed to answer this? 


Can only those hope, who can talk? Only those who have mastered the use of 
a language. That is to say, the phenomena of hope are modes of this 
complicated form of life. (If a concept refers to a character of human 
handwriting, it has no application to beings that do not write.) 


“Grief” describes a pattern which recurs, with different variations, in the 
weave of our life. Of a man’s bodily expression of sorrow and of joy 
alternated, say with the ticking of a clock, here we should not have the 
characteristic formation of the pattern of sorrow or of the pattern of joy. 


“For a second he felt violent pain.”—Why does it sound queer to say: “For a 
second he felt deep grief”? Only because it so seldom happens? 


But don’t you feel grief now ? (“But aren’t you playing chess now?” The 
answer may be affirmative, but that does not make the concept of grief any 
more like the concept of a sensation.—The question was really, of course, a 
temporal and personal one, not the logical question which we wanted to 
raise. 


“T must tell you: I am frightened.” 
“T must tell you: it makes me shiver.”— 
And one can say this in a smiling tone of voice too. 


And do you mean to tell me he doesn’t feel it? How else does he know it?— 
But even when he says it as a piece of information he does not learn it from 
his sensations. 


For think of the sensations produced by physically shuddering: the words “it 
makes me shiver” are themselves such a shuddering re action; and if I hear 
and feel them as I utter them, this belongs among the rest of those sensations. 
How why should the wordless shudder be the ground of the verbal one? 


11 


In saying “When I heard this word, it meant .... to me” one refers to a point 
of time and to a way of using the word (Of course, it is this combination that 
we fail to grasp.) 


And the expression “I was then going to say.” refers to a point of time and to 
an action. 


I speak of the essential references of the utterance in order to dis tinguish 
them from other peculiarities of the expression we use. The references that 
are essential to an utterance are the ones which would make us translate 
some otherwise alien form of expression into this, our customary form. 


Of you were unable to say that the word “till” could be both a verb and a 
conjunction, or to construct sentences in which it was now the one and now 
the other, you would not be able to manage simple schoolroom exercises. But 
a schoolboy is not asked to conceive the word in one way or another out of 
any context, or to report how he has conceived it. 


The words “the rose is red” are meaningless if the word “is” has the meaning 
“is identical with”.—Does this mean: if you say this sentence and mean the 
“is” as the sign of identity, the sense disintegrates? 


We take a sentence and tell someone the meaning of each of its words; this 
tells him how to apply them and so how to apply the sentence too. Of we had 
chosen a senseless sequence of words instead of the sentence, he would not 
learn how to apply the sequence . And if we explain the word “is” as the sign 
of identity, then he does not learn how to use the sentence “the rose is red”. 


And yet there is something right about this ‘disintegration of the sense’. You 
get it in the following example: one might tell someone: if you want to 
pronounce the salutation “Hail!” expressively, you had better not think of 
hailstones as you say it. 


Experiencing a meaning and experiencing a mental image. “In both cases”, 
we should like to say, “we are experiencing something, only something 
different. A different content is proffered—is present— to consciousness.”— 
What is the content of the experience of imagin ing? The answer is a picture, 
or a description. And what is the content of the experience of meaning? I 
don’t know what I am supposed to say to this.—If there is any sense in the 
above remark, it is that the two concepts are related like those of ‘red’ and 


‘blue’; and that is wrong. 


Can one keep hold of an understanding of meaning as one can keep hold of a 
mental image? That is, if one meaning of a word suddenly strikes me,—can it 
also stay there in my mind? 


“The whole scheme presented itself to my mind in a flash and stayed there 
like that for five minutes.” Why does this sound odd? One would like to 
think: what flashed on me and what stayed there in my mind can’t have been 
the same. 


I exclaimed “Now I have it!”—a sudden start, and then I was able to set the 
scheme forth in detail. That is supposed to have stayed in this case? A 
picture, perhaps. But “Now I have it” did not mean, I have the picture. 


Of a meaning of a word has occurred to you and you have not for gotten it 
again, you can now use the word in such-and-such a way. 


Of the meaning has occurred to you, now you know it, and the know ing 
began when it occurred to you. When how is it like an experience of 
imagining something? 


Of I say “Mr. Scot is not a Scot”, I mean the first “Scot” as a proper name, the 
second one as a common name. When do different things have to go on in 
my mind at the first and second “Scot”? (Assuming that I am not uttering the 
sentence ‘parrot-wise’.)—Try to mean the first “Scot” as a common name and 
the second one as a proper name.— How is it done? When I do it, I blink 
with the effort as I try to parade the right meanings before my mind in saying 
the words.—But do I parade the meanings of the words before my mind 
when I make the ordinary use of them? 


When I say the sentence with this exchange of meanings I feel that its sense 
disintegrates.—Well, I feel it, but the person I am saying it to does not. To 
what harm is done?-“But the point is, when one utters the sentence in the 
usual way something else, quite definite, takes place.” What takes place is 
not this ‘parade of the meanings before one’s mind’. 


111 


That makes my image of him into an image of him him? 
Not its looking like him. 


The same question applies to the expression “I see him now vividly before 
me” as to the image. That makes this utterance into an utter ance about him 
?—Nothing in it or simultaneous with it (behind it*). Of you want to know 
whom he meant, ask him. 


(But it is also possible for a face to come before my mind, and even for me to 
be able to draw it, without my knowing whose it is or where I have seen it.) 


Suppose, however, that someone were to draw while he had an image or 
instead of having it, though it were only with his finger in the air. (This 
might be called “motor imagery.”) We could be asked: “Whom does that 
represent?” And his answer would be decisive.— It is quite as if he had given 
a verbal description: and such a description can also simply take the place of 
the image. 


1V 


“I believe that he is suffering.” ——Do I also believe that he isn’t an 
automaton? 


It would go against the grain to use the word in both connexions. 


(Or is it like this: I believe that he is suffering, but am certain that he is not 
an automaton? Nonsense 1) 


Suppose I say of a friend: “He isn’t an automaton”.—What informa tion is 
conveyed by this, and to whom would it be information? To a human being 
who meets him in ordinary circumstances? That information could it give 
him? (At the very most that this man always behaves like a human being, 
and not occasionally like a machine.) 


“T believe that he is not an automaton”, just like that, so far makes no sense. 


By attitude towards him is an attitude towards a soul. I am not of the opinion 
that he has a soul. 


Religion teaches that the soul can exist when the body has dis- integrated. 
How do I understand this teaching?—Of course I under stand it-1 can 
imagine plenty of things in connexion with it. And haven’t pictures of these 
things been painted? And why should such a picture be only an imperfect 
rendering of the spoken doctrine? Why should it not do the same service as 
the words? And it is the service which is the point. 


Of the picture of thought in the head can force itself upon us, then why not 
much more that of thought in the soul? 


The human body is the best picture of the human soul. 


And how about such an expression as: “In my heart I understood when you 
said that”, pointing to one’s heart? Does one, perhaps, not mean this gesture? 
Of course one means it. Or is one conscious of using a mere figure? Indeed 
not.—It is not a figure that we choose, not a simile, yet it is a figurative 
expression. 


V 


Suppose we were observing the movement of a point (for example, a point of 
light on a screen). It might be possible to draw important consequences of 
the most various kinds from the behaviour of this point. And what a variety 
of observations can be made here!—The path of the point and certain of its 
characteristic measures (amplitude and wave-length for instance), or the 
velocity and the law according to which it varies, or the number or position 
of the places at which it changes discontinuously, or the curvature of the 
path at these places, and innumerable other things.—Any of these features of 
its behaviour might be the only one to interest us. We might, for example, be 
in different to everything about its movements except for the number of 
loops it made in a certain time.—And if we were interested, not in just one 
such feature, but in several, each might yield us special information, different 
iii kind from all the rest. This is how it is with the behaviour of man; with 
the different characteristic features which we observe in this behaviour. 


When psychology treats of behaviour, not of the mind? 


That do psychologists record?—What do they observe? Isn’t it the behaviour 
of human beings, in particular their utterances? But these are not about 
behaviour. 


“T noticed that he was out of humour.” Is this a report about his behaviour or 
his state of mind? (“The sky looks threatening”: is this about the present or 
the future?) Both; not side-by-side, however, but about the one via the other. 


A doctor asks: “How is he feeling?” The nurse says: “He is groaning”. A 
report on his behaviour. But need there be any question for them whether the 
groaning is really genuine, is really the expression of anything? Might they 
not, for example, draw the conclusion “If he groans, we must give him more 
analgesic”—without suppressing a middle term? Isn’t the point the service to 
which they put the descrip tion of behaviour? 


“But then they make a tacit presupposition.” When what we do in our 
language-game always rests on a tacit presupposition. 


I describe a psychological experiment: the apparatus, the questions of the 
experimenter, the actions and replies of the subject—and then I say that it is 
a scene in a play.—Now everything is different. To it will be said: Of this 
experiment were described in the same way in a book on psychology, then 
the behaviour described would be understood as the expression of something 


mental just because it is presupposed that the subject is not taking us in, 
hasn’t learnt the replies by heart, and other things of the kind.—So we are 
making a presupposition? 


Should we ever really express ourselves like this: “Naturally I am 
presupposing that.”?—Or do we not do so only because the other person 
already knows that? 


Doesn’t a presupposition imply a doubt? And doubt may be entirely lacking. 
Doubting has an end. 


It is like the relation: physical object—sense-impressions. Here we have two 
different language-games and a complicated relation between them.—If you 
try to reduce their relations to a simple formula you go wrong. 


vi 


Suppose someone said: every familiar word, in a book for example, actually 
carries an atmosphere with it in our minds, a ‘corona’ of lightly indicated 
uses.—Just as if each figure in a painting were surrounded by delicate 
shadowy drawings of scenes, as it were in another dimension, and in them 
we saw the figures in different con texts.—Only let us take this assumption 
seriously!—Then we see that it is not adequate to explain intention . 


For if it is like this, if the possible uses of a word do float before us in half- 
shades as we say or hear it—this simply goes for us . But we communicate 
with other people without knowing if they have this experience too. 


How should we counter someone who told us that with him under standing 
was an inner process?-How should we counter him if he said that with him 
knowing how to play chess was an inner process?— We should say that when 
we want to know if he can play chess we aren’t interested in anything that 
goes on inside him.—And if he replies that this is in fact just what we are 
interested in, that is, we are interested in whether he can play chess—then 
we shall have to draw his attention to the criteria which would demonstrate 
his capacity, and on the other hand to the criteria for the ‘inner states’. 


Even if someone had a particular capacity only when, and only as long as, he 
had a particular feeling, the feeling would not be the capacity. 


The meaning of a word is not the experience one has in hearing or saying it, 
and the sense of a sentence is not a complex of such ex periences.—(How do 
the meanings of the individual words make up the sense of the sentence “I 
still haven’t seen him yet”?) The sentence is composed of the words, and that 
is enough. 


Though—one would like to say—every word has a different character in 
different contexts, at the same time there is one character it always has: a 
single physiognomy. It looks at us.—But a face in a painting looks at us too. 


Are you sure that there is a single if-feeling, and not perhaps several? Have 
you tried saying the word in a great variety of contexts? For example, when 
it bears the principal stress of the sentence, and when the word next to it 
does. 


Suppose we found a man who, speaking of how words felt to him, told us 
that “if” and “but” felt the same .—Should we have the right to disbelieve 


him? We might think it strange. “He doesn’t play our game at all”, one would 
like to say. Or even: “This is a different type of man.” 


Of he used the words “if” and “but” as we do, shouldn’t we think he 
understood them as we do? 


One misjudges the psychological interest of the if-feeling if one regards it as 
the obvious correlate of a meaning; it needs rather to be seen in a different 
context, in that of the special circumstances in which it occurs. 


Does a person never have the if-feeling when he is not uttering the word “if”? 
Surely it is at least remarkable if this cause alone produces this feeling. And 
this applies generally to the ‘atmosphere’ of a word;—why does one regard it 
so much as a matter of course that only this word has this atmosphere? 


The if-feeling is not a feeling which accompanies the word “if”. 


The if-feeling would have to be compared with the special ‘feeling’ which a 
musical phrase gives us. (One sometimes describes such a feeling by saying 
“Here it is as if a conclusion were being drawn”, or 


“T should like to say ‘hence .””, or “Here I should always like to make a 
gesture—” and then one makes it.) 


But can this feeling be separated from the phrase? And yet it is not the 
phrase itself, for that can be heard without the feeling. 


Is it in this respect like the ‘expression’ with which the phrase is played? 


We say this passage gives us a quite special feeling. We sing it to ourselves, 
and make a certain movement, and also perhaps have some special sensation. 
But in a different context we should not recognize these accompaniments— 
the movement, the sensation—at all. They are quite empty except just when 
we are singing this passage. 


“T sing it with a quite particular expression.” This expression is not something 
that can be separated from the passage. It is a different concept. (A different 
game.) 


The experience is this passage played like this (that is, as I am doing it, for 
instance; a description could only hint at it). 


Thus the atmosphere that is inseparable from its object—is not an 
atmosphere. 


Closely associated things, things which we have associated, seem to fit one 


another. But what is this seeming to fit? How is their seeming to fit 
manifested? Perhaps like this: we cannot imagine the man who had this 
name, this face, this handwriting, not to have produced these works, but 
perhaps quite different ones instead (those of another great man). 


We cannot imagine it? To we try?— 


Here is a possibility: I hear that someone is painting a picture “Beethoven 
writing the ninth symphony”. I could easily imagine the kind of thing such a 
picture would shew us. But suppose someone wanted to represent what 
Goethe would have looked like writing the ninth symphony? Here I could 
imagine nothing that would not be embarrassing and ridiculous. 


Vil 


People who on waking tell us certain incidents (that they have been in such- 
and-such places, etc.). When we teach them the expression “I dreamt”, which 
precedes the narrative. Afterwards I sometimes ask them “did you dream 
anything last night?” and am answered yes or no, sometimes with an account 
of a dream, sometimes not. That is the language-game. (I have assumed here 
that I do not dream myself. But then, nor do I ever have the feeling of an 
invisible presence; other people do, and I can question them about their 
experiences.) 


How must I make some assumption about whether people are deceived by 
their memories or not; whether they really had these images while they slept, 
or whether it merely seems so to them on waking? And what meaning has 
this question?—And what interest? To we ever ask ourselves this when 
someone is telling us his dream? And if not—is it because we are sure his 
memory won’t have deceived him? (And suppose it were a man with a quite 
specially bad memory?—) 


Does this mean that it is nonsense ever to raise the question whether dreams 
really take place during sleep, or are a memory phenomenon of the 
awakened? It will turn on the use of the question. 


“The mind seems able to give a word meaning”—isn’t this as if I were to say 
“The carbon atoms in benzene seem to lie at the comers of a hexagon”? But 
this is not something that seems to be so; it is a picture. 


The evolution of the higher animals and of man, and the awakening of 
consciousness at a particular level. The picture is something like this: Though 
the ether is filled with vibrations the world is d&ik But one day man opens 
his seeing eye, and there is light. 


That this language primarily describes is a picture. That is to be done with 
the picture, how it is to be used, is still obscure. Quite clearly, however, it 
must be explored if we want to understand the sense of what we are saying. 
But the picture seems to spare us this work: it already points to a particular 
use. This is how it takes us in. 


“My kinaesthetic sensations advise me of the movement and position of my 
limbs.” 


I let my index finger make an easy pendulum movement of small amplitude. I 


either hardly feel it, or don’t feel it at all. Perhaps a little in the tip of the 
finger, as a slight tension. (Not at all in the joint.) And this sensation advises 
me of the movement?—for I can describe the movement exactly. 


“But after all, you must feel it, otherwise you wouldn’t know (without 
looking) how your finger was moving.” But “knowing” it only means: being 
able to describe it.—I may be able to tell the direc tion from which a sound 
comes only because it affects one ear more strongly than the other, but I 
don’t feel this in my ears; yet it has its effect: I know the direction from 
which the sound comes; for instance, I look in that direction. 


It is the same with the idea that it must be some feature of our pain that 
advises us of the whereabouts of the pain in the body, and some feature of 
our memory image that tells us the time to which it belongs. 


A sensation can advise us of the movement or position of a limb. (For 
example, if you do not know, as a normal person does, whether your arm is 
stretched out, you might find out by a piercing pain in the elbow.)—In the 
same way the character of a pain can tell us where the injury is. (And the 
yellowness of a photograph how old it is.) 


That is the criterion for my learning the shape and colour of an object from a 
sense-impression? 


That sense-impression? Well, this one; I use words or a picture to describe it. 


And now: what do you feel when your fingers are in this position? “How is 
one to define a feeling? It is something special and indefinable.” But it must 
be possible to teach the use of the words I 


That I am looking for is the grammatical difference. 


Let us leave the kinaesthetic feeling out for the moment.—I want to describe 
a feeling to someone, and I tell him “Do this , and then you'll get it,” and I 
hold my arm or my head in a particular position. How is this a description of 
a feeling? and when shall I say that he has under stood what feeling I meant? 
—He will have to give a further description of the feeling afterwards. And 
what kind of description must it be? 


I say “Do this , and you'll get it”. Can’t there be a doubt here? Mustn’t there 
be one, if it is a feeling that is meant? 


This looks so; this tastes so; this feels so . “This” and “so” must be differendy 
explained. 


Our interest in a ‘feeling’ is of a quite particular kind. It includes, for 
instance, the ‘degree of the feeling’, its ‘place’, and the extent to which one 
feeling can be submerged by another. (When a movement is very painful, so 
that the pain submerges every other slight sensation in the same place, does 
this make it uncertain whether you have really made this movement? Would 
it lead you to find out by looking?) 


1X 


Of you observe your own grief, which senses do you use to observe it? A 
particular sense; one that feels grief? When do you feel it differently when 
you are observing it? And what is the grief that you are observ ing—is it one 
which is there only while it is being observed? 


Observing” does not produce what is observed. (That is a concep tual 
statement.) 


Again: I do not ’observe” what only comes into being through observation. 
The object of observation is something else. 


A touch which was still painful yesterday is no longer so today. 


Today I feel the pain only when I think about it. (That is: in certain 
circumstances.) 


By grief is no longer the same; a memory which was still unbear able to me a 
year ago is now no longer so. 


That is a result of observation. 


When do we say that any one is observing? Roughly: when he puts, himself 
in a favourable position to receive certain impressions in order (for example) 
to describe what they tell him. 


Of you trained someone to emit a particular sound at the sight of something 
red, another at the sight of something yellow, and so on for other colours, 
still he would not yet be describing objects by their colours. Though he might 
be a help to us in giving a descrip tion. A description is a representation of a 
distribution in a space (in that of time, for instance). 


Of I let my gaze wander round a room and suddenly it lights on an object of 
a striking red colour, and I say “Red!”“—that is not a description. 


Are the words “I am afraid” a description of a state of mind? 


I say “I am afraid”; someone else asks me: “What was that? A cry of fear; or 
do you want to tell me how you feel; or is it a reflection on your present 
state?’”—Could I always give him a clear answer? Would I never give him 
one? 


We can imagine all sorts of things here, for example: 

“No, no! I am afraid!” 

“T am afraid. I am sorry to have to confess it.” 

“T am still a bit afraid, but no longer as much as before.” 

“At bottom I am still afraid, though I won’t confess it to myself.” 
“T torment myself with all sorts of fears.” 

“Now, just when I should be fearless, I am afraid!” 


To each of these sentences a special tone of voice is appropriate, and a 
different context. 


It would be possible to imagine people who as it were thought much more 
definitely than we, and used different words where we use only one. 


We ask “What does A am frightened’ really mean, what am I referring to 
when I say it?” And of course we find no answer, or one that is inadequate. 


The question is: “In what sort of context does it occur?” 


I can find no answer if I try to settle the question “What am I referring to?” 
“What am I thinking when I say it?” by repeating the expression of fear and 
at the same time attending to myself, as it were observing my soul out of the 
corner of my eye. In a concrete case I can indeed ask “Why did I say that, 
what did I mean by it?”— and I might answer the question too; but not on 
the ground of observ ing what accompanied the speaking. And my answer 
would supple ment, paraphrase, the earlier utterance. 


That is fear? That does “being afraid” mean? Of I wanted to define it at a 
single shewing—I should play-act fear. 


Would I also represent hope in this way? Hardly. And what about belief? 


Describing my state of mind (of fear, say) is something I do in a particular 
context. (Just as it takes a particular context to make a certain action into an 
experiment.) 


Is it, then, so surprising that I use the same expression in different games? 
And sometimes as it were between the games? 


And do I always talk with very definite purpose?—And is what I say 


meaningless because I don’t? 


When it is said in a funeral oration “We mourn our....” this is surely 
supposed to be an expression of mourning; not to tell anything to those who 
are present. But in a prayer at the grave these words would in a way be used 
to tell someone something. 


But here is the problem: a cry, which cannot be called a description, which is 
more primitive than any description, for all that serves as a description of the 
inner life. 


A cry is not a description. But there are transitions. And the words “I am 
afraid” may approximate more, or less, to being a cry. They may come quite 
close to this and also be far removed from it. 


We surely do not always say someone is complaining, because he says he is 
in pain. To the words “I am in pain” may be a cry of com plaint, and may be 
something else. 


But if “I am afraid” is not always something like a cry of complaint and yet 
sometimes is, then why should it always be a description of a state of mind? 


Xx 


How did we ever come to use such an expression as “I believe ...”? Did we at 
some time become aware of a phenomenon (of belief)? 


Did we observe ourselves and other people and so discover belief? 


Moore’s paradox can be put like this: the expression “I believe that this is the 
case” is used like the assertion “This is the case”; and yet the hypothesis that 
I believe this is the case is not used like the hypothesis that this is the case. 


To it looks as if the assertion “I believe” were not the assertion of what is 
supposed in the hypothesis “I believe”! 


Similarly: the statement “I believe it’s going to rain” has a meaning like, that 
is to say a use like, “It’s going to rain”, but the meaning of “I believed then 
that it was going to rain”, is not like that of “It did rain then”. 


“But surely A believed’ must tell of just the same thing in the past as A 
believe’ in the present!”—Surely i must mean just the same in relation to — i, 
as “/ITmeans in relation to i! This means nothing at all. 


“At bottom, when I say A believe..I am describing my own state of mind—but 
this description is indirectly an assertion of the fact believed.”—As in certain 
circumstances I describe a photograph in order to describe the thing it is a 
photograph of. 


But then I must also be able to say that the photograph is a good one. To 
here too: “I believe it’s raining and my belief is reliable, so I have confidence 
in it.”—In that case my belief would be a kind of sense-impression. 


One can mistrust one’s own senses, but not one’s own belief. 


Of there were a verb meaning ‘to believe falsely’, it would not have any 
significant first person present indicative. 


Don’t look at it as a matter of course, but as a most remarkable thing, that 


0 66. 


the verbs “believe”, “wish”, “will” display all the inflexions possessed by 


cc 0? 


cut”, 


> 


chew”, “run”. 


The language-game of reporting can be given such a turn that a report is not 
meant to inform the hearer about its subject matter but about the person 
making the report. 


It is so when, for instance, a teacher examines a pupil. (You can measure to 
test the ruler.) 


Suppose I were to introduce some expression—“I believe”, for instance—in 
this way: it is to be prefixed to reports when they serve to give information 
about the reporter. (So the expression need not carry with it any suggestion 
of uncertainty. Remember that the uncer tainty of an assertion can be 
expressed impersonally: “He might come today”.)—“I believe ...., and it isn’t 
so” would be a contradiction. 


“T believe....” throws light on my state. Conclusions about my conduct can be 
drawn from this expression. To there is a similarity here to expressions of 
emotion, of mood, etc.. 


If, however, “I believe it is so” throws light on my state, then so does the 
assertion “It is so”. For the sign “I believe” can’t do it, can at the most hint at 
it. 


Imagine a language in which “I believe it is so” is expressed only by means of 
the tone of the assertion “It is so”. In this language they say, not “He 
believes” but “He is inclined to say....” and there exists also the hypothetical 
(subjunctive) “Suppose I were inclined etc.”, but not the expression “I am 
inclined to say”. 


Moore’s paradox would not exist in this language; instead of it, however, 
there would be a verb lacking one inflexion. 


But this ought not to surprise us. Think of the fact that one can predict one’s 
own future action by an expression of intention. 


I say of someone else “He seems to believe ....” and other people say it of me. 
Now, why do I never say it of myself, not even when others rightly say it of 
me?—Do I myself not see and hear myself, then?—That can be said. 


“One feels conviction within oneself, one doesn’t infer it from one’s own 
words or their tone.”—-What is true here is: one does not infer one’s own 
conviction from one’s own words; nor yet the actions which arise from that 
conviction. 


“Here it looks as if the assertion ‘I believe’ were not the assertion of what is 
supposed in the hypothesis.”—So I am tempted to look for a different 
development of the verb in the first person present indicative. 


This is how I think of it: Believing is a state of mind. It has duration; and that 
independently of the duration of its expression in a sentence, for example. To 


it is a kind of disposition of the believing person. This is shewn me in the 
case of someone else by his behaviour; and by his words. And under this 
head, by the expression “I believe .. .’ as well as by the simple assertion.— 
What about my own case: how do I myself recognize my own disposition?— 
Here it will have been necessary for me to take notice of myself as others do, 
to listen to myself talking, to be able to draw conclusions from what I sayl 


By own relation to my words is wholly different from other people’s. 


That different development of the verb would have been possible, if only I 
could say “I seem to believe”. 


Of I listened to the words of my mouth, I might say that someone else was 
speaking out of my mouth. 


“Judging from what I say, this is what I believe.” Now, it is possible to think 
out circumstances in which these words would make sense. 


And then it would also be possible for someone to say “It is raining and I 
don’t believe it”, or “It seems to me that my ego believes this, but it isn’t 
true.” One would have to fill out the picture with behaviour indicating that 
two people were speaking through my mouth. 


Even in the hypothesis the pattern is not what you think. 


When you say “Suppose I believe ....” you are presupposing the whole 
grammar of the word “to believe”, the ordinary use, of which you are master. 
—You are not supposing some state of affairs which, so to speak, a picture 
presents unambiguously to you, so that you can tack on to this hypothetical 
use some assertive use other than the ordinary one.—You would not know at 
all what you were supposing here (i.e. what, for example, would follow from 
such a supposition), if you were not already familiar with the use of 
“Delieve”. 


Think of the expression “I say ....”, for example in “I say it will rain today”, 
which simply comes to the same thing as the assertion “It will.. ..”. “He says 
it will. ...” means approximately “He believes it will....”. “Suppose I say ....” 
does not mean: Suppose it rains today. 


Different concepts touch here and coincide over a stretch. But you need not 
think that all lines are circles . 


Consider the misbegotten sentence “It may be raining, but it isn’t”. 


And here one should be on one’s guard against saying that “It may be 


raining” really means “I think it’ll be raining.” For why not the other way 
round, why should not the latter mean the former? 


Don’t regard a hesitant assertion as an assertion of hesitancy. 


X1 


Two uses of the word “see”. 


The one: “What do you see there?”—“I see this” (and then a descrip tion, a 
drawing, a copy). The other: “I see a likeness between these two faces”—let 
the man I tell this to be seeing the faces as clearly as I do myself. 


The importance of this is the difference of category between the two ’objects* 
of sight. 


The one man might make an accurate drawing of the two faces, and the other 
notice in the drawing the likeness which the former did not see. 


I contemplate a face, and then suddenly notice its likeness to an other. I see 
that it has not changed; and yet I see it differently. I call this experience 
“noticing an aspect”. 


Its causes are of interest to psychologists. 


We are interested in the concept and its place among the concepts of 
experience. 


You could imagine the illustration 


appearing in several places in a book, a text-book for instance. In the relevant 
text something different is in question every time: here a glass cube, there an 
inverted open box, there a wire frame of that shape, there three boards 
forming a solid angle. Each time the text supplies the interpretation of the 
illustration. 


But we can also see the illustration now as one thing now as another. —So 
we interpret it, and see it as we interpret it. 


Here perhaps we should like to reply: The description of what is got 
immediately, i.e. of the visual experience, by means of an inter pretation—is 
an indirect description. “I see the figure as a box” means: I have a particular 


visual experience which I have found that I always have when I interpret the 
figure as a box or when I look at a box. But if it meant this I ought to know 
it. I ought to be able to refer to the experience directly, and not only 
indirectly. (As I can speak of red without calling it the colour of blood.) 


I shall call the following figure, derived from Jastrow 1 , the duck- rabbit. It 
can be seen as a rabbit’s head or as a duck’s. 


And I must distinguish between the ‘continuous seeing’ of an aspect and the 
‘dawning’ of an aspect. 


The picture might have been shewn me, and I never have seen anything but a 
rabbit in it. 


Here it is useful to introduce the idea of a picture-object. For instance 


would be a ‘picture-face’. 


In some respects I stand towards it as I do towards a human face. I can study 
its expression, can react to it as to the expression of the human face. A child 
can talk to picture-men or picture-animals, can treat them as it treats dolls. 


I may, then, have seen the duck-rabbit simply as a picture-rabbit from the 
first. That is to say, if asked “What’s that?” or “What do you see here?” I 
should have replied: “A picture-rabbit”. Of I had further been asked what 
that was, I should have explained by pointing to all sorts of pictures of 
rabbits, should perhaps have pointed to real rabbits, talked about their 
habits, or given an imitation of them. 


I should not have answered the question “What do you see here?” by saying: 
“Now I am seeing it as a picture-rabbit”. I should simply have described my 
perception: just as if I had said “I see a red circle over there.”— 


Nevertheless someone else could have said of me: “He is seeing the figure as 


a picture-rabbit.” 


It would have made as little sense for me to say “Now I am seeing it as ...” as 
to say at the sight of a knife and fork “Now I am seeing this as a knife and 
fork”. This expression would not be understood.— Any more than: “Now it’s 
a fork” or “It can be a fork too”. 


One doesn’t * take’ what one knows as the cutlery at a meal for cutlery; any 
more than one ordinarily tries to move one’s mouth as one eats, or aims at 
moving it. 


Of you say “Now it’s a face for me”, we can ask: “What change are you 
alluding to?” 


I see two pictures, with the duck-rabbit surrounded by rabbits in one, by 
ducks in the other. I do not notice that they are the same. Does it follow from 
this that I see something different in the two cases?— It gives us a reason for 
using this expression here. 


“T saw it quite differently, I should never have recognized it I” Now, that is 
an exclamation. And there is also a justification for it. 


I should never have thought of superimposing the heads like that, of making 
this comparison between them. For they suggest a different mode of 
comparison. 


For has the head seen like this the slightest similarity to the head seen like 
this -although they are congruent. 


I am shewn a picture-rabbit and asked what it is; I say “It’s a rabbit”. Not 
“Now it’s a rabbit”. I am reporting my perception.—I am shewn the duck- 
rabbit and asked what it is; I may say “It’s a duck-rabbit”. But I may also 
react to the question quite differently.—The answer that it is a duck-rabbit is 
again the report of a perception; the answer “Now it’s a rabbit” is not. Had I 
replied “It’s a rabbit”, the ambiguity would have escaped me, and I should 
have been reporting my per ception. 


The change of aspect. “But surely you would say that the picture is altogether 
different now!” 


But what is different: my impression? my point of view?—Can I say? I 
describe the alteration like a perception; quite as if the object had altered 
before my eyes. 


“Now I am seeing this”, I might say (pointing to another picture, for 


example). This has the form of a report of a new perception. 


The expression of a change of aspect is the expression of a new perception 
and at the same time of the perception’s being unchanged. 


I suddenly see the solution of a puzzle-picture. Before, there were branches 
there; now there is a human shape. By visual impression has changed and 
now I recognize that it has not only shape and colour but also a quite 
particular ‘organization’.—My visual impression has changed;—what was it 
like before and what is it like now?—If I represent it by means of an exact 
copy—and isn’t that a good repre sentation of it?—no change is shewn. 


And above all do not say “After all my visual impression isn’t the drawing, it 
is this -which I can’t shew to anyone.”—Of course it is not the drawing, but 
neither is it anything of the same category, which I carry within myself. 


The concept of the ‘inner picture’ is misleading, for this concept uses the < 
outer picture’ as a model; and yet the uses of the words for these concepts are 
no more like one another than the uses of ‘numeral’ and ‘number’. (And if 
one chose to call numbers ‘ideal numerals’, one might produce a similar 
confusion. ) 


Of you put the ‘organization’ of a visual impression on a level with colours 
and shapes, you are proceeding from the idea of the visual impression as an 
inner object. Of course this makes this object into a chimera; a queerly 
shifting construction. For the similarity to a picture is now impaired. 


Of I know that the schematic cube has various aspects and I want to find out 
what someone else sees, I can get him to make a model of what he sees, in 
addition to a copy, or to point to such a model; even though he has no idea 
of my purpose in demanding two accounts. 


But when we have a changing aspect the case is altered. How the only 
possible expression of our experience is what before perhaps seemed, or even 
was, a useless specification when once we had the copy. 


And this by itself wrecks the comparison of ‘organization’ with colour and 
shape in visual impressions. 


Of I saw the duck-rabbit as a rabbit, then I saw: these shapes and colours (I 
give them in detail)—and I saw besides something like this: 


and here I point to a number of different pictures of rabbits.—This shews the 
difference between the concepts. 


‘Seeing as ....’ is not part of perception. And for that reason it is like seeing 
and again not like. 


I look at an animal and am asked: “What do you see?” I answer: “A rabbit”.— 
I see a landscape; suddenly a rabbit runs past. I exclaim “A rabbit!” 


Both things, both the report and the exclamation, are expressions of 
perception and of visual experience. But the exclamation is so in a different 
sense from the report: it is forced from us.—It is related to the experience as 
a cry is to pain. 


But since it is the description of a perception, it can also be called the 
expression of thought.-If you are looking at the object, you need not think of 
it; but if you are having the visual experience expressed by the exclamation, 
you are also thinking of what you see. 


Hence the flashing of an aspect on us seems half visual experience, half 
thought. 


Someone suddenly sees an appearance which he does not recognize (it may 
be a familiar object, but in an unusual position or lighting); the lack of 
recognition perhaps lasts only a few seconds. Is it correct to say he has a 
different visual experience from someone who knew the object at once? 


For might not someone be able to describe an unfamiliar shape that appeared 
before him just as accurately as I, to whom it is familiar? And isn’t that the 
answer?—Of course it will not generally be so. And his description will run 
quite differently. (I say, for example, “The animal had long ears”—he: “There 
were two long appendages”, and then he draws them.) 


I meet someone whom I have not seen for years; I see him clearly, but fail to 
know him. Suddenly I know him, I see the old face in the altered one. I 
believe that I should do a different portrait of him now if I could paint. 


Now, when I know my acquaintance in a crowd, perhaps after looking in his 
direction for quite a while,—is this a special sort of seeing? Is it a case of 
both seeing and thinking? or an amalgam of the two, as I should almost like 
to say? 


The question is: why does one want to say this? 


The very expression which is also a report of what is seen, is here a cry of 
recognition. 


That is the criterion of the visual experience?—The criterion? That do you 


suppose? 
The representation of ’what is seen 5 . 


The concept of a representation of what is seen, like that of a copy, is very 
elastic, and so together with it is the concept of what is seen. The two are 
intimately connected. (Which is not to say that they are alike.) 


How does one tell that human beings see three-dimensionally?— I ask 
someone about the lie of the land (over there) of which he has a view. “Is it 
like this?” (I shew him with my hand)—“Yes.”—“How do you know?”—“It’s 
not misty, I see it quite clear.”—He does not give reasons for the surmise. 
The only thing that is natural to us is to represent what we see three- 
dimensionally; special practice and training are needed for two-dimensional 
representation whether in drawing or in words. (The queemess of children’s 
drawings.) 


Of someone sees a smile and does not know it for a smile, does not 
understand it as such, does he see it differently from someone who 
understands it?—He mimics it differently, for instance. 


Told the drawing of a face upside down and you can’t recognize the 
expression of the face. Perhaps you can see that it is smiling, but not exactly 
what kind of smile it is. You cannot imitate the smile or describe it more 
exactly. 


And yet the picture which you have turned round may be a most exact 
representation of a person’s face. The figure (a) 


is the reverse of the figure (b) 


But—I should like to say—there is a different difference between my 
impressions of (c) and (d) and between those of (a) and (b). (d), for example, 
looks neater than (c). (Compare a remark of Lewis Carroll’s.) (d) is easy, (c) 
hard to copy. 


Imagine the duck-rabbit hidden in a tangle of lines. How I suddenly notice it 


in the picture, and notice it simply as the head of a rabbit. It some later time 
I look at the same picture and notice the same figure, but see it as the duck, 
without necessarily realizing that it was the same figure both times.—If I 
later see the aspect change—can I say that the duck and rabbit aspects are 
now seen quite differently from when I recognized them separately in the 
tangle of lines? No. 


But the change produces a surprise not produced by the recog nition. 


Of you search in a figure (1) for another figure (2), and then find it, you see 
(1) in a new way. Not only can you give a new kind of descrip tion of it, but 
noticing the second figure was a new visual experience. 


But you would not necessarily want to say “Figure (1) looks quite different 
now; it isn’t even in the least like the figure I saw before, though they are 
congruent!” 


There are here hugely many interrelated phenomena and possible concepts. 


When is the copy of the figure an incomplete description of my visual 
experience? No.—But the circumstances decide whether, and what, more 
detailed specifications are necessary.—It may be an incomplete description; if 
there is still something to ask. 


Of course we can say: There are certain things which fall equally under the 
concept picture-rabbit’ and under the concept picture- duck’. And a picture, a 
drawing, is such a thing.—But the impression is not simultaneously of a 
picture-duck and a picture-rabbit. 


“What I really see must surely be what is produced in me by the influence of 
the object”—Then what is produced in me is a sort of copy, something that in 
its turn can be looked at, can be before one; almost something like a 
materialisation. 


And this materialization is something spatial and it must be possible to 
describe it in purely spatial terms. For instance (if it is a face) it can smile; 
the concept of friendliness, however, has no place in an account of it, but is 
foreign to such an account (even though it may subserve it). 


Of you ask me what I saw, perhaps I shall be able to make a sketch which 
shews you; but I shall mostly have no recollection of the way my glance 
shifted in looking at it. 


The concept of ‘seeing’ makes a tangled impression. Well, it is tangled.—I 
look at the landscape, my gaze ranges over it, I see all sorts of distinct and 


indistinct movement; this impresses itself sharply on me, that is quite hazy. 
After all, how completely ragged what we see can appear 1 And now look at 
all that can be meant by “description of what is seen”.—But this just is what 
is called descrip tion of what is seen. There is not one genuine proper case of 
such description—the rest being just vague, something which awaits 
clarification, or which must just be swept aside as rubbish. 


Here we are in enormous danger of wanting to make fine distinc tions.—It is 
the same when one tries to define the concept of a material object in terms of 
‘what is really seen’.—What we have rather to do is to accept the everyday 
language-game, and to note false accounts of the matter as false. The 
primitive language-game which children are taught needs no justification; 
attempts at justification need to be rejected. 


Make as an example the aspects of a triangle. This triangle 


can be seen as a triangular hole, as a solid, as a geometrical drawing; as 
standing on its base, as hanging from its apex; as a mountain, as a wedge, as 
an arrow or pointer, as an overturned object which is meant to stand on the 
shorter side of the right angle, as a half parallel ogram, and as various other 
things. 


“You can think now of this now of this as you look at it, can regard it now as 
this now as this, and then you will see it now this way, now this.”—What 
way? There is no further qualification. 


But how is it possible to see an object according to an interpretation ?— The 
question represents it as a queer fact; as if something were being forced into 
a form it did not really fit. But no squeezing, no forcing took place here. 


When it looks as if there were no room for such a form between other ones 
you have to look for it in another dimension. Of there is no room here, there 
is room in another dimension. 


(It is in this sense too that there is no room for imaginary numbers in the 
continuum of real numbers. But what this means is: the applica tion of the 
concept of imaginary numbers is less like that of real numbers than appears 
from the look of the calculations . It is necessary to get down to the 
application, and then the concept finds a different place, one which, so to 
speak, one never dreamed of.) 


How would the following account do: “What I can see something as, is what 
it can be a picture of”? 


That this means is: the aspects in a change of aspects are those ones which 
the figure might sometimes have permanently in a picture. 


A triangle can really be standing up in one picture, be hanging in another, 
and can in a third be something that has fallen over.—That is, I who am 
looking at it say, not “It may also be something that has fallen over”, but 
“That glass has fallen over and is lying there in fragments”. This is how we 
react to the picture. 


Would I say what a picture must be like to produce this effect? No. There are, 
for example, styles of painting which do not convey anything to me in this 
immediate way, but do to other people. I think custom and upbringing have 
a hand in this. 


That does it mean to say that I ‘see the sphere floating in the air’ in a picture? 


Is it enough that this description is the first to hand, is the matter- of-course 
one? No, for it might be so for various reasons. This might, for instance, 
simply be the conventional description. 


That is the expression of my not merely understanding the picture in this 
way, for instance, (knowing what it is supposed to be), but seeing it in this 
way?—It is expressed by: “The sphere seems to float”, “You see it floating”,- 
or again, in a special tone of voice, “It floats!” 


This, then, is the expression of taking something for something. But not being 
used as such. 


Here we are not asking ourselves what are the causes and what produces this 
impression in a particular case. 


And is it a special impression?—“Surely I see something different when I see 
the sphere floating from when I merely see it lying there.”— This really 
means: This expression is justified 1 —(For taken literally it is no more than a 
repetition.) 


(And yet my impression is not that of a real floating sphere either. There are 

various forms of ‘three-dimensional seeing’. The three- dimensional character 
of a photograph and the three-dimensional character of what we see through 
a stereoscope.) 


“And is it really a different impression?”—In order to answer this I should 


like to ask myself whether there is really something different there in me. But 
how can I find out?- 1 describe what I am seeing differently. 


Certain drawings are always seen as flat figures, and others some times, or 
always, three-dimensionally. 


Here one would now like to say: the visual impression of what is seen three- 
dimensionally is three-dimensional; with the schematic cube, for instance, it 
is a cube. (For the description of the impression is the description of a cube.) 


And then it seems queer that with some drawings our impression should be a 
flat thing, and with some a three-dimensional thing. One asks oneself “Where 
is this going to end?” 


When I see the picture of a galloping horse—do I merely know that this is the 
kind of movement meant? Is it superstition to think I see the horse galloping 
in the picture?-And does my visual impression gallop too? 


That does anyone tell me by saying “Now I see it as.”? 
That consequences has this information? That can I do with it? 


People often associate colours with vowels. Someone might find that a vowel 
changed its colour when it was repeated over and over again. We finds a 
‘now blue—now red’, for instance. 


The expression “Now I am seeing it as ...” might have no more significance 
for us than: “Now I find a red”. 


(Linked with physiological observations, even this change might acquire 
importance for us.) 


Here it occurs to me that in conversation on aesthetic matters we use the 
words: “You have to see it like this, this is how it is meant”; “When you see it 
like this, you see where it goes wrong”; “You have to hear this bar as an 
introduction”; “You must hear it in this key”; “You must phrase it like this” 
(which can refer to hearing as well as to playing). This figure a 


a 


is supposed to represent a convex step and to be used in some kind of 


topological demonstration. For this purpose we draw the straight line a 
through the geometric centres of the two surfaces.—Now if anyone’s three- 
dimensional impression of the figure were never more than momentary, and 
even so were now concave, now convex, that might make it difficult for him 
to follow our demonstration. And if he finds that the flat aspect alternates 
with a three-dimensional one, that is just as if I were to shew him completely 
different objects in the course of the demonstration. 


That does it mean for me to look at a drawing in descriptive geometry and 
say: “I know that this line appears again here, but I can’t see it like that”? 
Does it simply mean a lack of familiarity in operating with the drawing; that 
I don’t ‘know my way about’ too well?—This familiarity is certainly one of 
our criteria. That tells us that someone is seeing the drawing three- 
dimensionally is a certain kind of ‘knowing one’s way about’. Certain 
gestures, for instance, which indicate the three-dimensional relations: fine 
shades of behaviour. 


I see that an animal in a picture is transfixed by an arrow. It has struck it in 
the throat and sticks out at the back of the neck. Let the picture be a 
silhouette.—Do you see the arrow—or do you merely know that these two 
bits are supposed to represent part of an arrow? 


(Compare Kohler’s figure of the interpenetrating hexagons.) 


“But this isn’t seeing "-’But this is seeing 1”—It must be possible to give both 
remarks a conceptual justification. 


But this is seeing I In what sense is it seeing? 


“The phenomenon is at first surprising, but a physiological explana tion of it 
will certainly be found.”— 


Our problem is not a causal but a conceptual one. 


Of the picture of the transfixed beast or of the interpenetrating hexagons 
were shewn to me just for a moment and then I had to describe it, that would 
be my description; if I had to draw it I should certainly produce a very faulty 
copy, but it would shew some sort of animal transfixed by an arrow, or two 
hexagons interpenetrating. That is to say: there are certain mistakes that I 
should not make. 


The first thing to jump to my eye in this picture is: there are two hexagons. 


How I look at them and ask myself: “Do I really see them as hexa gons?”— 
and for the whole time they are before my eyes? (Assuming that they have 


not changed their aspect in that time.)—And I should like to reply: “I am not 
thinking of them as hexagons the whole time.” 


Someone tells me: “I saw it at once as two hexagons. And that’s the whole of 
what I saw.” But how do I understand this? I think he would have given this 
description at once in answer to the question “What are you seeing?”, nor 
would he have treated it as one among several possibilities. In this his 
description is like the answer “A face” on being shewn the figure 


The best description I can give of what was shewn me for a moment is this :. 


“The impression was that of a rearing animal.” To a perfectly definite 
description came out.—Was it seeing, or was it a thought? 


To not try to analyse your own inner experience. 


Of course I might also have seen the picture first as something different, and 
then have said to myself “Oh, it’s two hexagons!” To the aspect would have 
altered. And does this prove that I in fact saw it as something definite? 


“Is ita genuine visual experience?” The question is: in what sense is it one? 
Here it is difficult to see that what is at issue is the fixing of conce pts. 
A concept forces itself on one. (This is what you must not forget.) 


For when should I call it a mere case of knowing, not seeing?— Perhaps 
when someone treats the picture as a working drawing, reads it like a 
blueprint. (Fine shades of behaviour.—Why are they important ? They have 
important consequences.) “To me it is an animal pierced by an arrow.” That 
is what I treat it as; this is my attitude to the figure. This is one meaning in 
calling it a case of ‘seeing’. 


But can I say in the same sense: “To me these are two hexagons”? Not in the 
same sense, but in a similar one. 


You need to think of the role which pictures such as paintings (as opposed to 
working drawings) have in our lives. This role is by no means a uniform one. 


A comparison: texts are sometimes hung on the wall. But not theorems of 
mechanics. (Our relation to these two things.) 


Of you see the drawing as such-and-such an animal, what I expect from you 
will be pretty different from what I expect when you merely know what it is 
meant to be. 


Perhaps the following expression would have been better: we regard the 
photograph, the picture on our wall, as the object itself (the man, landscape, 
and so on) depicted there. 


This need not have been so. We could easily imagine people who did not 
have this relation to such pictures. Who, for example, would be repelled by 
photographs, because a face without colour and even perhaps a face reduced 
in scale struck them as inhuman. 


I say: “We regard a portrait as a human being,”—but when do we do so, and 
for how long? Always , if we see it at all (and do not, say, see it as something 
else)? 


I might say yes to this, and that would determine the concept of regarding-as. 
—The question is whether yet another concept, related to this one, is also of 
importance to us: that, namely, of a seeing-as which only takes place while I 
am actually concerning myself with the picture as the object depicted. 


I might say: a picture does not always live for me while I am seeing it. 


“Her picture smiles down on me from the wall.” It need not always do so, 
whenever my glance lights on it. 


The duck-rabbit. One asks oneself: how can the eye—this dot — be looking in 
a direction?— “See, it is Jookingl” (And one ‘looks’ one self as one says this.) 
But one does not say and do this the whole time one is looking at the picture. 
And now, what is this “See, it’s looking!” —does it express a sensation? 


(In giving all these examples I am not aiming at some kind of completeness, 
some classification of psychological concepts. They are only meant to enable 
the reader to shift for himself when he encounters conceptual difficulties.) 


“Now I see it as a ....” goes with “I am trying to see it as a ... or”I can’t see it 
as a.... yet”. But I cannot try to see a conventional picture of a lion as a lion, 
any more than an A as that letter. (Though I may well try to see it asa 
gallows, for example.) 


To not ask yourself “How does it work with /we?”—Ask “What do I know 
about someone else?” 


How does one play the game: “It could be this too”? (What a figure could 


also be—which is what it can be seen as—is not simply another figure. Of 
someone said “I see 


as 
he might still be meaning very different things.) 


Here is a game played by children: they say that a chest, for example, is a 
house; and thereupon it is interpreted as a house in every detail. A piece of 
fancy is worked into it. 


And does the child now see the chest as a house? 


“He quite forgets that it is a chest; for him it actually is a house.” (There are 
definite tokens of this.) When would it not also be correct to say he sees it as 
a house? 


And if you knew how to play this game, and, given a particular situation, you 
exclaimed with special expression “Now it’s a house!”— you would be giving 
expression to the dawning of an aspect. 


Of I heard someone talking about the duck-rabbit, and now he spoke in a 
certain way about the special expression of die rabbit’s face I should say, now 
he’s seeing the picture as a rabbit. 


But the expression in one’s voice and gestures is the same as if the object had 
altered and had ended by becoming this or that. 


I have a theme played to me several times and each time in a slower tempo. 
In the end I say “Now it’s right”, or “Now at last it’s a march”, “Now at last 
it’s a dance”.—The same tone of voice expresses the dawning of an aspect. 


’Fine shades of behaviour/—When my understanding of a theme is expressed 
by my whistling it with the correct expression, this is an example of such fine 
shades. 


The aspects of the triangle: it is as if an image came into contact, and fora 


time remained in contact, with the visual impression. 


In this, however, these aspects differ from the concave and convex aspects of 
the step (for example). And also from the aspects of the figure 


(which I shall call a “double cross”) as a white cross on a black ground and as 
a black cross on a white ground. 


You must remember that the descriptions of the alternating aspects are of a 
different kind in each case. 


(The temptation to say “I see it like this”, pointing to the same thing for “it” 
and “this”.) Always get rid of the idea of the private object in this way: 
assume that it constantly changes, but that you do not notice the change 
because your memory constantly deceives you. 


Those two aspects of the double cross (I shall call them the aspects A) might 
be reported simply by pointing alternately to an isolated white and an 
isolated black cross. 


One could quite well imagine this as a primitive reaction in a child even 
before it could talk. 


(Thus in reporting the aspects A we point to a part of the double cross.—The 
duck and rabbit aspects could not be described in an analogous way.) 


You only ‘see the duck and rabbit aspects’ if you are already conver sant with 
the shapes of those two animals. There is no analogous con dition for seeing 
the aspects A. 


It is possible to take the duck-rabbit simply for the picture of a rabbit, the 
double cross simply for the picture of a black cross, but not to take the bare 
triangular figure for the picture of an object that has fallen over. To see this 
aspect of the triangle demands imagination . 


The aspects A are not essentially three-dimensional; a black cross on a white 
ground is not essentially a cross with a white surface in the background. You 
could teach someone the idea of the black cross on a ground of different 
colour without shewing him anything but crosses painted on sheets of paper. 
Here the ‘background’ is simply the surrounding of the cross. 


The aspects A are not connected with the possibility of illusion in the same 
way as are the three-dimensional aspects of the drawing of a cube or step. 


I can see the schematic cube as a box;—but can I also see it now as a paper, 
now as a tin, box?—-What ought I to say, if someone assured me he could?—I 
can set a limit to the concept here. 


Let think of the expression “felt” in connexion with looking at a picture. 
(“One feels the softness of that material.”) (Knowing in dreams. “And I knew 
that .. . was in the room.”) 


How does one teach a child (say in arithmetic) “Now take these things 
together!” or. “Now these go together”? Clearly “taking together” and “going 
together” must originally have had another meaning for him than that of 
seeing in this way or that.—And this is a remark about concepts, not about 
teaching methods. 


One kind of aspect might be called ‘aspects of organization’. When the aspect 
changes parts of the picture go together which before did not. 


In the triangle I can see now this as apex, that as base—now this as apex, 
that as base.—Clearly the words “Now I am seeing this as the apex” cannot 
so far mean anything to a learner who has only just met the concepts of apex, 
base, and so on.—But I do not mean this as an empirical proposition. 


9 06. 


“Now he’s seeing it like this”, “now like that” would only be said of someone 
capable of making certain applications of the figure quite freely. 


The substratum of this experience is the mastery of a technique. 


But how queer for this to be the logical condition of someone’s having such- 
and-such an experience After all, you don’t say that one only ‘has toothache’ 
if one is capable of doing such-and-such.—From this it follows that we 
cannot be dealing with the same concept of experience here. It is a different 
though related concept. It is only if someone can do, has learnt, is master of, 
such-and-such, that it makes sense to say he has had this experience. 


And if this sounds crazy, you need to reflect that the concept of seeing is 
modified here. (A similar consideration is often necessary to get rid of a 
feeling of dizziness in mathematics.) 


We talk, we utter words, and only later get a picture of their life. 


For how could I see that this posture was hesitant before I knew that it was a 
posture and not the anatomy of the animal? 


But surely that only means that I cannot use this concept to describe the 
object of sight, just because it has more than purely visual reference?” Might 
I not for all that have a purely visual concept of a hesitant posture, or of a 
timid face? 


Such a concept would be comparable with ‘major’ and ‘minor’ which 
certainly have emotional value, but can also be used purely to describe a 
perceived structure. 


The epithet “sad”, as applied for example to the outline face, characterizes 
the grouping of lines in a circle. Applied to a human being it has a different 
(though related) meaning. (But this does not mean that a sad expression is 
like the feeling of sadness!) 


Think of this too: I can only see, not hear, red and green,—but sadness I can 
hear as much as I can see it. 


Think of the expression “I heard a plaintive melody”. And now the question 
is: “Does he hear the plaint?” 


And if I reply: “No, he doesn’t hear it, he merely has a sense of it”— where 
does that get us? One cannot mention a sense-organ for this ‘sense’. 


Some would like to reply here: “Of course I hear it!”—Others: “I don’t really 
hear it.” 


We can, however, establish differences of concept here. 


We react to the visual impression differently from someone who does not 
recognize it as timid (in the full sense of the word).—But I do not want to say 
here that we feel this reaction in our muscles and joints and that this is the 
‘sensing’.—No, what we have here is a modified concept of sensation . 


One might say of someone that he was blind to the expression of a face. 
Would his eyesight on that account be defective? 


This is, of course, not simply a question for physiology. Here the 
physiological is a symbol of the logical. 


Of you feel the seriousness of a tune, what are you perceiving?— Nothing 
that could be conveyed by reproducing what you heard. 


I can imagine some arbitrary cipher—this, for instance: 


to be a stricdy correct letter of some foreign alphabet. Or again, to be a 
faultily written one, and faulty in this way or that: for example, it might be 


slap-dash, or typical childish awkwardness, or like the flourishes in a legal 
document. It could deviate from the correctly written letter in a variety of 
ways.—And I can see it in various aspects according to the fiction I surround 
it with. And here there is a close kinship with ‘experiencing the meaning of a 
word’. 


I should like to say that what dawns here lasts only as long as I am occupied 
with the object in a particular way. (“See, it’s looking!”)- 


‘I should like to say’—and is it so?-Ask yourself “For how long am I struck by 
a thing?”—For how long do I find it new ? 


The aspect presents a physiognomy which then passes away. It is almost as if 
there were a face there which at first I imitate , and then accept without 
imitating it—And isn’t this really explanation enough? —But isn’t it too 
much? 


“I observed the likeness between him and his father for a few minutes, and 
then no longer.”—One might say this if his face were changing and only 
looked like his father’s for a short time. But it can also mean that after a few 
minutes I stopped being struck by the likeness. 


“After the likeness had struck you, how long were you aware of it?” That 
kind of answer might one give to this question? “I soon stopped thinking 
about it”, or “It struck me again from time to time”, or “I several times had 
the thought, how like they arel”, or “I mar velled at the likeness for at least a 
minute”—That is the sort of answer you would get. 


I should like to put the question “Am I aware of the spatial character, the 
depth of an object (of this cupboard for instance), the whole time 


I am seeing it?” To I, so to speak, feel it the whole time?—But put the 
question in the third person.—When would you say of someone that he was 
aware of it the whole time, and when the opposite?—Of course, one could 
ask him,—but how did he learn how to answer such a question? —He knows 
what it means “to feel pain continuously”. But that will only confuse him 
here (as it confuses me). 


Of he now says he is continuously aware of the depth—do I believe him? And 
if he says he is aware of it only occasionally (when talking about it, perhaps) 
—do I believe that ? These answers will strike me as resting on a false 
foundation.—It will be different if he says that the object sometimes strikes 
him as flat, sometimes as three-dimensional. 


Someone tells me: “I looked at the flower, but was thinking of something else 


and was not conscious of its colour.” To I understand this?—I can imagine a 
significant context, say his going on: “Then I suddenly saw it, and realized it 
was the one which.”. 


Or again: “If I had turned away then, I could not have said what colour it 
was.” 


“He looked at it without seeing it.”—There is such a thing. But what is the 
criterion for it?—Well, there is a variety of cases here. 


“Just now I looked at the shape rather than at the colour.” To not let such 
phrases confuse you. Above all, don’t wonder “What can be going on in the 
eyes or brain?” 


The likeness makes a striking impression on me; then the impression fades. 
It only struck me for a few minutes, and then no longer did. 


That happened here?—What can I recall? By own facial expression comes to 
mind; I could reproduce it. Of someone who knew me had seen my face he 
would have said “Something about his face struck you just now”.—There 
further occurs to me what I say on such an occa sion, out loud or to myself. 
And that is all—And is this what being struck is? No. These are the 
phenomena of being struck; but they are ‘what happens’. 


Is being struck looking plus thinking? No. Any of our concepts cross here. 


(‘Thinking’ and ‘inward speech’—I do not say € to oneself —are different 
concepts.) 


The colour of the visual impression corresponds to the colour of the object 
(this blotting paper looks pink to me, and is pink)—the shape of the visual 
impression to the shape of the object (it looks rect angular to me, and is 
rectangular)—but what I perceive in the dawning of an aspect is not a 
property of the object, but an internal relation between it and other objects. 


It is almost as if ‘seeing the sign in this context’ were an echo of a thought. 
“The echo of a thought in sight”—one would like to say. 


Imagine a physiological explanation of the experience. Let it be this: When 
we look at the figure, our eyes scan it repeatedly, always following a 
particular path. The path corresponds to a particular pattern of oscillation of 
the eyeballs in the act of looking. It is possible to jump from one such pattern 
to another and for the two to alternate. (Aspects A.) Certain patterns of 


movement are physiologically im possible; hence, for example, I cannot see 
the schematic cube as two interpenetrating prisms. And so on. Let this be the 
explanation.— “Yes, that shews it is a kind of seeing”—You have now 
introduced a new, a physiological, criterion for seeing. And this can screen 
the old problem from view, but not solve it.The purpose of this paragraph 
however, was to bring before our view what happens when a physio logical 
explanation is offered. The psychological concept hangs out of reach of this 
explanation. And this makes the nature of the problem clearer. 


To I really see something different each time, or do I only interpret what I 
see in a different way? I am inclined to say the former. But why?—To 
interpret is to think, to do something; seeing is a state. 


How it is easy to recognize cases in which we are interpreting. When we 
interpret we form hypotheses, which may prove false.—“I am seeing this 
figure as a.” can be verified as little as (or in the same sense as) “I am seeing 
bright red”. To there is a similarity in the use of “seeing” in the two contexts. 
Only do not think you knew in advance what the “state of seeing” means 
here! Let the use teach you the meaning. 


We find certain things about seeing puzzling, because we do not find the 
whole business of seeing puzzling enough. 


Of you look at a photograph of people, houses and trees, you do not feel the 
lack of the third dimension in it. We should not find it easy to describe a 
photograph as a collection of colour-patches on a flat surface; but what we 
see in a stereoscope looks three-dimensional in a different way again. 


(it is anything but a matter of course that we see ‘three-dimension- ally’ with 
two eyes. Of the two visual images are amalgamated, we might expect a 
blurred one as a result.) 


The concept of an aspect is akin to the concept of an image. In other words: 
the concept “I air now seeing it as ... .’ is akin to A am now having this 
image’. 

Doesn’t it take imagination to hear something as a variation on a particular 


theme? And yet one is perceiving something in so hearing it. 


“Imagine this changed like this, and you have this other thing.” One can use 
imagining in the course of proving something. 


Seeing an aspect and imagining are subject to the will. There is such an order 
as “Imagine this”, and also: “Now see the figure like this”; but not: “Now see 
this leaf green”. 


The question now arises: Would there be human beings lacking in the 
capacity to see something as something —and what would that be like? That 
sort of consequences would it have?—Would this defect be comparable to 
colour-blindness or to not having absolute pitch?— We will call it “aspect- 
blindness”—and will next consider what might be meant by this. (A 
conceptual investigation.) The aspect-blind man is supposed not to see the 
aspects A change. But is he also supposed not to recognize that the double 
cross contains both a black and a white cross? To if told “Shew me figures 
containing a black cross among these examples” will he be unable to manage 
it? No, he should be able to do that; but he will not be supposed to say: “Now 
it’s a black cross on a white ground I” 


Is he supposed to be blind to the similarity between two faces?— And so also 
to their identity or approximate identity? I do not want to settle this. (He 
ought to be able to execute such orders as “Bring me something that looks 
like this”) 


Ought he to be unable to see the schematic cube as a cube?—It would not 
follow from that that he could not recognize it as a repre sentation (a 
working drawing for instance) of a cube. But for him it would not jump from 
one aspect to the other.—Question: Ought he to be able to take it as a cube in 
certain circumstances, as we do?— Of not, this could not very well be called 
a sort of blindness. 


The ‘aspect-blind’ will have an altogether different relationship to pictures 
from ours. 


(Anomalies of this kind are easy for us to imagine.) 
Aspect-blindness will be akin to the lack of a ‘musical ear’. 


The importance of this concept lies in the connexion between the concepts of 
‘seeing an aspect’ and ‘experiencing the meaning of a word’. For we want to 
ask “What would you be missing if you did not experience the meaning of a 
word?” 


That would you be missing, for instance, if you did not understand the 
request to pronounce the word “till” and to mean it as a verb,—or if you did 
not feel that a word lost its meaning and became a mere sound if it was 
repeated ten times over? 


In a law-court, for instance, the question might be raised how someone 
meant a word. And this can be inferred from certain facts.— It is a question 
of intention . But could how he experienced a word— the word “bank” for 
instance—have been significant in the same way? 


Suppose I had agreed on a code with someone; “tower” means bank. I tell 
him “Now go to the tower”—he understands me and acts accordingly, but he 
feels the word “tower” to be strange in this use, it has not yet ‘taken on’ the 
meaning. 


“When I read a poem or narrative with feeling, surely something goes on in 
me which does not go on when I merely skim the lines for information.”— 
What processes am I alluding to?—The sentences have a different ring. I pay 
careful attention to my intonation. Sometimes a word has the wrong 
intonation, I emphasize it too much or too little. I notice this and shew it in 
my face. I might later talk about my reading in detail, for example about the 
mistakes in my tone of voice. Sometimes a picture, as it were an illustration, 
comes to me. And this seems to help me to read with the correct expression. 
And I could mention a good deal more of the same kind.—I can also give a 
word a tone of voice which brings out the meaning of the rest, almost as if 
this word were a picture of the whole thing. (And this may, of course, depend 
on sentence-formation.) 


When I pronounce this word while reading with expression it is completely 
filled with its meaning.—“How can this be, if meaning is the use of the 
word?” Well, what I said was intended figuratively. Not that I chose the 
figure: it forced itself on me.—But the figurative employment of the word 
can’t get into conflict with the original one. 


Perhaps it could be explained why precisely this picture suggests itself to me. 
(Just think of the expression, and the meaning of the expression: “the word 
that hits it off’.) , 


But if a sentence can strike me as like a painting in words, and the very 
individual word in the sentence as like a picture, then it is no such marvel 
that a word uttered in isolation and without purpose can seem to carry a 
particular meaning in itself. 


Think here of a special kind of illusion which throws light on these matters. 
—I go for a walk in the environs of a city with a friend. Is we talk it comes 
out that I am imagining the city to lie on our right. Not only have I no 
conscious reason for this assumption, but some quite simple consideration 
was enough to make me realize that the city lay rather to the left ahead of us. 
I can at first give no answer to the question why I imagine the city in this 
direction. I had no reason to think it. But though I see no reason still I seem 
to see certain psychological causes for it. In particular, certain associations 
and memories. For example, we walked along a canal, and once before in 
similar circumstances I had followed a canal and that time the city lay on our 
right.—I might try as it were psychoanalytically to discover the causes of my 


unfounded conviction. 


“But what is this queer experience?”—Of course it is not queerer than any 
other; it simply differs in kind from those experiences which we regard as the 
most fundamental ones, our sense impressions for instance. 


“I feel as if I knew the city lay over there.”—“I feel as if the name ‘Schubert’ 
fitted Schubert’s works and Schubert’s face.” 


You can say the word “March” to yourself and mean it at one time as an 
imperative at another as the name of a month. And now say “March 1”—and 
then “March no furtber '"—Does the same experience accompany the word 
both times—are you sure? 


Of a sensitive ear shews me, when I am playing this game, that I have now 
this now that experience of the word—doesn’t it also shew me that I often do 
not have any experience of it in the course of talk ing?—-For the fact that I 
then also mean it, intend it, now like this now like that , and maybe also say 
so later is, of course, not in question. 


But the question now remains why, in connexion with this game of 
experiencing a word, we also speak of ‘the meaning’ and of ‘m eanin g it’.— 
This is a different kind of question.-It is the phenomenon which is 
characteristic of this language-game that in this situation we use this 
expression: we say we pronounced the word with this meaning and take this 
expression over from that other language-game. 


All it a dream. It does not change anything. 


Given the two ideas ‘fat’ and ‘lean’, would you be rather inclined to say that 
Wednesday was fat and Tuesday lean, or vice versa ? (I incline decisively 
towards the former.) How have “fat” and “lean” some different meaning here 
from their usual one?—They have a different use.-—So ought I really to have 
used different words? Certainly not that.—I want to use these words (with 
their familiar meanings) here. —Now, I say nothing about the causes of this 
phenomenon. They might be associations from my childhood. But that is a 
hypothesis. Whatever the explanation,—the inclination is there. 


Asked “What do you really mean here by ‘fat’ and ‘lean’?”_I 


could only explain the meanings in the usual way. I could not point to the 
examples of Tuesday and Wednesday. 


Here one might speak of a ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ sense of a word. It is 
only if the word has the primary sense for you that you use it in the 


secondary one. 


Only if you have learnt to calculate—on paper or out loud—can you be made 
to grasp, by means of this concept, what calculating in the head is. 


The secondary sense is not a ‘metaphorical’ sense. Of I say “For me the vowel 
e is yellow” I do not mean: ‘yellow’ in a metaphorical sense,—for I could not 
express what I want to say in any other way than by means of the idea 
‘yellow’. 


Someone tells me: “Wait for me by the bank”. Question: Did you, as you were 
saying the word, mean this bank?—This question is of the same kind as “Did 
you intend to say such-and-such to him on your way to meet him?” It refers 
to a definite time (the time of walking, as the former question refers to the 
time of speaking)—but not to an experience during that time. Meaning is as 
little an experience as intending. 


But what distinguishes them from experience?—They have no experience- 
content. For the contents (images for instance) which accompany and 
illustrate them are not the meaning or intending. 


The intention with which one acts does not ’accompany” the action any more 
than the thought ’accompanies” speech. Thought and inten tion are neither 
’articulated” nor ’non-articulated”; to be compared neither with a single note 
which sounds during the acting or speaking, nor with a tune. 


’Talking” (whether out loud or silently) and ’thinking” are not concepts of the 
same kind; even though they are in closest connexion. 


The interest of the experiences one has while speaking and of the intention is 
not the same. (The experiences might perhaps inform a psychologist about 
the ’ unconscious ” intention.) 


“At that word we both thought of him.”” Let us assume that each of us said 
the same words to himself—and how can it mean MORE than that?—But 
wouldn’t even those words be only a germ} They must surely belong to a 
language and to a context, in order really to be the expression of the thought 
of that man. 


Of Rod had looked into our minds he would not have been able to see there 
whom we were speaking of. 


“Why did you look at me at that word, were you thinking of... .?”” —So 
there is a reaction at a certain moment and it is explained by saying “I 
thought of....”” or “I suddenly remembered 


In saying this you refer to that moment in the time you were speaking. It 
makes a difference whether you refer to this or to that moment. 


Here explanation of a word does not refer to an occurrence at the moment of 
speaking. 


The language-game “I mean (or meant) this 97 (subsequent explana tion of a 
word) is quite different from this one:”I thought of.... as I said it.”” The latter 
is akin to “It reminded me of....”” 


“T have already remembered three times today that I must write to him.”” Of 
what importance is it what went on in me then?—On the other hand what is 
the importance, what the interest, of the statement itself?—It permits certain 
conclusions. 


“At these words he occurred to me.”—What is the primitive reaction with 
which the language-game begins—which can then be translated I into these 
words? How do people get to use these words? 


The primitive reaction may have been a glance or a gesture, but it may also 
have been a word. 


“Why did you look at me and shake your head?”—“I wanted to give you to 
understand that you.” This is supposed to express not 2 


symbolic convention but the purpose of my action. 


Meaning it is not a process which accompanies a word. For no process could 
have the consequences of meaning. 


(Similarly, I think, it could be said: a calculation is not an experi ment, for no 
experiment could have the peculiar consequences of a multiplication.) 


There are important accompanying phenomena of talking which are often 
missing when one talks without thinking, and this is characteristic of talking 
without thinking. But they are not the thinking. 


“Now I know 1” That went on here?-So did I not know, when 
I declared that now I knew? 

You are looking at it wrong. 

(What is the signal for?) 


And could the ‘knowing’ be called an accompaniment of the exclamation? 


The familiar physiognomy of a word, the feeling that it has taken up its 
meaning into itself, that it is an actual likeness of its meaning—there could 
be human beings to whom all this was alien. (They would not have an 
attachment to their words.)—And how are these feelings manifested among 
us?—By the way we choose and value words. 


How do I find the ‘right’ word? How do I choose among words? Without 
doubt it is sometimes as if I were comparing them by fine differences of 
smell: That is too., that is too., —this is the right one.—But I do not always 
have to make judgments, give explanations; often I might only say: “It simply 
isn’t right yet”. I am dissatisfied, I go on looking. It last a word comes: “Thafs 
it!” Sometimes I can say why. This is simply what searching, this is what 
finding, is like here. 


But doesn’t the word that occurs to you somehow ‘come’ in a special way? 
Must attend and you'll see!—Careful attention is no use to me. All it could 
discover would be what is now going on in me. 


And how can I, precisely now, listen for it at all? I ought to have to wait until 
a word occurs to me anew. This, however, is the queer thing: it seems as 
though I did not have to wait on the occasion, but could give myself an 
exhibition of it, even when it is not actually taking place. How?—I act it.— 
But what can I learn in this way? That do I reproduce?—Characteristic 
accompaniments. Primarily: gestures, faces, tones of voice. 


It is possible—and this is important—to say a great deal about a line 
aesthetic difference.—The first thing you say may, of course, be just: “This 
word fits, that doesn’t”—or something of the kind. But then you can discuss 
all the extensive ramifications of the tie-up effected by each of the words. 
That first judgment is not the end of the matter, for it is the field of force of a 
word that is decisive. 


“The word is on the tip of my tongue.” That is going on in my consciousness? 
That is not the point at all. Whatever did go on was not what was meant by 
that expression. It is of more interest what went on in my behaviour.—“The 
word is on the tip of my tongue” tells you: the word which belongs here has 
escaped me, but I hope to find it soon. For the rest the verbal expression does 
no more than certain wordless behaviour. 


James, in writing of this subject, is really trying to say: “What a remarkable 
experience! The word is not there yet, and yet in a certain sense is there,—or 
something is there, which cannot grow into anything but this word.”—But 
this is not experience at all. Interpreted as experience it does indeed look 
odd. Is does intention, when it is interpreted as the accompaniment of action; 


or again, like minus one interpreted as a cardinal number. 


The words “It’s on the tip of my tongue” are no more the expression of an 
experience than “Now I know how to go on!”—We use them in certain 
situations > and they are surrounded by behaviour of a special kind, and 
also by some characteristic experiences. In particular they are frequently 
followed by finding the word. (Ask yourself: “What would it be like if human 
beings never found the word that was on the tip of their tongue?”) 


Silent ‘internal’ speech is not a half hidden phenomenon which is as it were 
seen through a veil. It is not hidden at all, but the concept may easily confuse 
us, for it runs over a long stretch cheek by jowl with the concept of an 
‘outward’ process, and yet does not coincide with it. 


(The question whether the muscles of the larynx are innervated in connexion 
with internal speech, and similar things, may be of great interest, but not in 
our investigation.) 


The close relationship between ‘saying inwardly’ and ‘saying’ is manifested in 
the possibility of telling out loud what one said inwardly, and of an outward 
action’s accompanying inward speech. (I can sing inwardly, or read silently, 
or calculate in my head, and beat time with my hand as I do so.) 


“But saying things inwardly is surely a certain activity which I have to learn 
I” Very well; but what is ‘doing’ and what is ‘learning’ here? 


Let the use of words teach you their meaning. (Similarly one can often say in 
mathematics: let the proof teach you what was being proved.) 


“So I don’t really calculate, when I calculate in my head?”—After all, you 
yourself distinguish between calculation in the head and perceptible 
calculation! But you can only learn what ‘calculating in the head’ is by 
learning what ‘calculating’ is; you can only learn to calculate in your head by 
learning to calculate. 


One can say things in one’s head very ‘distinctly’, when one repro duces the 
tone of voice of one’s sentences by humming (with closed lips). Movements 
of the larynx help too. But the remarkable thing is precisely that one then 
hears the talk in one’s imagination and does not merely feel the skeleton of 
it, so to speak, in one’s larynx. (For human beings could also well be 
imagined calculating silently with movements of the larynx, as one can 
calculate on one’s fingers.) 


A hypothesis, such as that such-and-such went on in our bodies when we 
made internal calculations, is only of interest to us in that it points to a 


possible use of the expression “I said .... to myself”; namely that of inferring 
the physiological process from the expression. 


That what someone else says to himself is hidden from me is part of the 
concept ‘saying inwardly’. Only “hidden” is the wrong word | here; for if it is 
hidden from me, it ought to be apparent to him, he would have to know it. 
But he does not ’know” it; only, the doubt which exists for me does not exist 
for him. 


“What anyone says to himself within himself is hidden from me” might of 
course also mean that I can for the most part not guess it, nor can I read it off 
from, for example, the movements of his throat (which would be a 
possibility.) 


“T know what I want, wish, believe, feel,.” (and so on through all the 
psychological verbs) is either philosophers’ nonsense, or at any rate not a 
judgment a priori . 


“T know.. may mean”! do not doubt...” but does not mean that the words “I 
doubt...” are senseless , that doubt is logically excluded. 


One says “I know” where one can also say “I believe” or “I suspect”; where 
one can find out. (If you bring up against me the case of people’s saying “But 
I must know if Iam in pain!”, “Only you can know what you feel”, and 
similar things, you should consider the occasion and purpose of these 
phrases. “War is war” is not an example of the law of identity, either.) 


It is possible to imagine a case in which I could find out that I had two 
hands. Normally, however, I cannot do so. “But all you need is to hold them 
up before your eyes I”—If I am now in doubt whether I have two hands, I 
need not believe my eyes either. (I might just as well ask a friend.) 


With this is connected the fact that, for instance, the proposition “The Earth 
has existed for millions of years” makes clearer sense than “The Earth has 
existed in the last five minutes”. For I should ask anyone who asserted the 
latter: “What observations does this pro position refer to; and what 
observations would count against it?”— whereas I know what ideas and 
observations the former proposition goes with. 


“A new-born child has no teeth.”—“A goose has no teeth.”—“A rose has no 
teeth.”—This last at any rate—one would like to say—is obviously true! It is 
even surer than that a goose has none.—And yet it is none so clear. For 
where should a rose’s teeth have been? The goose has none in its jaw. And 
neither, of course, has it any in its wings; but no one means that when he 
says it has no teeth.—Why, suppose one were to say: the cow chews its food 


and then dungs the rose with it, so the rose has teeth in the mouth of a beast. 
This would not be absurd, because one has no notion in advance where to 
look for teeth in a rose. ((Connexion with ‘pain in someone else’s body’.)) 


I can know what someone else is thinking, not what I am thinking. 


It is correct to say “I know what you are thinking”, and wrong to say “I know 
what I am thinking.” 


(A whole cloud of philosophy condensed into a drop of grammar.) 


“A man’s thinking goes on within his consciousness in a seclusion’ in 
comparison with which any physical seclusion is an exhibition to public 
view.” 


Of there were people who always read the silent internal discourse of others 
—say by observing the larynx—would they too be inclined to use the picture 
of complete seclusion? 


Of I were to talk to myself out loud in a language not understood by those 
present my thoughts would be hidden from them. 


Let us assume there was a man who always guessed right what I was saying 
to myself in my thoughts. (It does not matter how he manages it.) But what is 
the criterion for his guessing right? Well, I am a truthful person and I confess 
that he has guessed right.—But might I not be mistaken, can my memory not 
deceive me? And might it not always do so when—without lying—I express 
what I have thought within myself?-But now it does appear that ‘what went 
on within me’ is not the point at all. (Here I am drawing a construction-line.) 


The criteria for the truth of the confession that I thought such-and-such are 
not the criteria for a true description of a process. And the import ance of the 
true confession does not reside in its being a correct and retrain report of a 
process. It resides rather in the special consequences which can be drawn 
from a confession whose truth is guaranteed by the special criteria of 
truthfulness. 


(Assuming that dreams can yield important information about the dreamer, 
what yielded the information would be truthful accounts of dreams. The 
question whether the dreamer’s memory deceives him when he reports the 
dream after waking cannot arise, unless indeed we introduce a completely 
new criterion for the report’s ‘agreeing’ 


with the dream, a criterion which gives us a concept of truth” as distinct 
from ’truthfulness* here.) 


There is a game of ’guessing thoughts”. A variant of it would be this: I tell A 
something in a language that A does not understand. A is supposed to guess 
the meaning of what I say.—Another variant: I write down a sentence which 
the other person cannot see. We has to guess the words or their sense.—Yet 
another: I am putting a jig-saw puzzle together; the other person cannot see 
me but from time to time guesses my thoughts and utters them. We says, for 
instance, “Now where is this bit ?—”Now I know how it fits !—”I have no 
idea what goes in here,**—“The sky is always the hardest part’* and so on— 


but I need not be talking to myself either out loud or silently at the time. 


All this would be guessing at thoughts; and the fact that it does not actually 
happen does not make thought any more hidden than the unperceived 
physical proceedings. 


“What is internal is hidden from us.**—The future is hidden from us. But 
does the astronomer think like this when he calculates an eclipse of the sun? 


Of I see someone writhing in pain with evident cause I do not think: all the 
same, his feelings are hidden from me. 


We also say of some people that they are transparent to us. It is, however, 
important as regards this observation that one human being can be a 
complete enigma to another. We learn this when we come into a strange 
country with entirely strange traditions; and, what is more, even given a 
mastery of the country’s language. We do not understand the people. (And 
not because of not knowing what they are saying to themselves.) We cannot 
find our feet with them. 


“T cannot know what is going on in him” is above all a picture . It is the 
convincing expression of a conviction. It does not give the reasons for the 
conviction. They are not readily accessible. 


Of a lion could talk, we could not understand him. 


It is possible to imagine a guessing of intentions like the guessing of thoughts, 
but also a guessing of what someone is actually going to do. 


To say “He alone can know what he intends” is nonsense: to say “He alone 
can know what he will do”, wrong. For the prediction contained in my 
expression of intention (for example “When it strikes five Iam going home”) 
need not come true, and someone else may know what will really happen. 


Two points, however, are important: one, that in many cases some one else 
cannot predict my actions, whereas I foresee them in my intentions; the 
other, that my prediction (in my expression of inten tion) has not the same 


foundation as his prediction of what I shall do, and the conclusions to be 
drawn from these predictions are quite different. 


I can be as certain of someone else’s sensations as of any fact. But this does 
not make the propositions “He is much depressed”, “25 A 25 = 625” and “I 
am sixty years old” into similar instruments. The explanation suggests itself 
that the certainty is of a different kind .— This seems to point to a 
psychological, difference. But the difference is logical. 


“But, if you are certain , isn’t it that you are shutting your eyes in face of 
doubt?”—They are shut. 


Am I less certain that this man is in pain than that twice two is four?—Does 
this shew the former to be mathematical certainty?- 


‘Mathematical certainty’ is not a psychological concept. 
The kind of certainty is the kind of language-game. 


“He alone knows his motives”—that is an expression of the fact that we ask 
him what his motives are.—If he is sincere he will tell us them; but I need 
more than sincerity to guess his motives. This is where there is a kinship with 
the case of knowing. 


Let yourself be struck by the existence of such a thing as our lan guage-game 
of: confessing the motive of my action. 


We remain unconscious of the prodigious diversity of all the every day 
language-games because the clothing of our language makes everything alike. 


Something new (spontaneous, ‘specific’) is always a language-game. 


That is the difference between cause and motive?—How is die motive 
discovered , and how the cause? 


There is such a question as: “Is this a reliable way of judging people’s 
motives?” But in order to be able to ask this we must know what “judging a 
motive” means; and we do not learn this by being told what ’ motive ’ is and 
what judging is. 


One judges the length of a rod and can look for and find some method of 
judging it more exactly or more reliably. So—you say— what is judged here 
is independent of the method of judging it. That length is cannot be defined 
by the method of determining length.— To think like this is to make a 
mistake. That mistake?—To say “The height of Mont Blanc depends on how 


one climbs it” would be queer. And one wants to compare ‘ever more 
accurate measurement of length’ with the nearer and nearer approach to an 
object. But in certain cases it is, and in certain cases it is not, clear what 
“approaching nearer to the length of an object” means. That “determining 
the length” means is not learned by learning what length and determining 
are; the meaning of the word “length” is learnt by learning, among other 
things, what it is to determine length. 


(For this reason the word “methodology” has a double meaning. Not only a 
physical investigation, but also a conceptual one, can be called 
“methodological investigation”.) 


We should sometimes like to call certainty and belief tones, colour ings, of 
thought; and it is true that they receive expression in the tone of voice. But 
do not think of them as ‘feelings’ which we have in speaking or thinking. 


Ask, not: “What goes on in us when we are certain that....?”— but: How is 
‘the certainty that this is the case’ manifested in human action? 


“While you can have complete certainty about someone else’s state of mind, 
still it is always merely subjective, not objective, certainty.” These two 
words betoken a difference between language-games. 


There can be a dispute over the correct result of a calculation (say of a rather 
long addition). But such disputes are rare and of short duration. They can be 
decided, as we say, ‘with certainty’. 


Mathematicians do not in general quarrel over the result of a calculation. 
(This is an important fact.)—If it were otherwise, if for instance one 
mathematician was convinced that a figure had altered unperceived, or that 
his or someone else’s memory had been deceived, and so on—then our 
concept of ‘mathematical certainty’ would not exist. 


Even then it might always be said: “True we can never know what the result 
of a calculation is, but for all that it always has a quite definite result. (God 
knows it.) Mathematics is indeed of the highest certainty—though we only 
have a crude reflection of it.” 


But am I trying to say some such thing as that the certainty of mathe matics 
is based on the reliability of ink and paper? No. (That would be a vicious 
circle.)—I have not said why mathematicians do not quarrel, but only that 
they do not. 


It is no doubt true that you could not calculate with certain sorts of paper 
and ink, if, that is, they were subject to certain queer changes— but still the 


fact that they changed could in turn only be got from memory and 
comparison with other means of calculation. And how are these tested in 
their turn? 


That has to be accepted, the given, is—so one could say —forms of life. 


Does it make sense to say that people generally agree in their jud g ments 
of colour? That would it be like for them not to?—One man would say a 
flower was red which another called blue, and so on.— But what right should 
we have to call these people’s words “red” and “blue” our ‘colour-words’?“— 


How would they learn to use these words? And is the language- game which 
they learn still such as we call the use of ‘names of colour’? There are 
evidendy differences of degree here. 


This consideration must, however, apply to mathematics too. Of there were 
not complete agreement, then neither would human beings be learning the 
technique which we learn. It would be more or less different from ours up to 
the point of unrecognizability. 


“But mathematical truth is independent of whether human beings know it or 
notl”—Certainly, the propositions “Human beings believe that twice two is 
four” and “Twice two is four” do not mean the same. The latter is a 
mathematical proposition; the other, if it makes sense at all, may perhaps 
mean: human beings have arrived at the mat-Vif»matiral proposition. The 
two propositions have entirely different uses .—But what would this mean: 
“Even though everybody believed that twice two was five it would still be 
four”?—For what would it be like for everybody to believe that?—Well, I 
could imagine, for instance, that people had a different calculus, or a 
technique which we should 


zzje not call “calculating”. But would it be wrong* (Is a coronation wrong ? 
To beings different from ourselves it might look extremely odd.) 


Of course, in one sense mathematics is a branch of knowledge,— but still it is 
also an activity. And ’false moves* can only exist as the exception. For if 
what we now call by that name became the rule, the game in which they 
were false moves would have been abrogated. 


“We all learn the same multiplication table.” This might, no doubt, be a 
remark about the teaching of arithmetic in our schools,—but also an 
observation about the concept of the multiplication table. (“In a horse-race 
the horses generally run as fast as they can.”) 


There is such a thing as colour-blindness and there are ways of establishing 


it. There is in general complete agreement in the judg ments of colours made 
by those who have been diagnosed normal. This characterizes the concept of 
a judgment of colour. 


There is in general no such agreement over the question whether an 
expression of feeling is genuine or not. 


I am sure, sure, that he is not pretending; but some third person is not. Can I 
always convince him? And if not is there some mistake in his reasoning or 
observations? 


“You're all at sea!”—-we say this when someone doubts what we recognize as 
clearly genuine—but we cannot prove anything. 


Is there such a thing as ’expert judgment* about the genuineness of 
expressions of feeling?—Even here, there are those whose judgment is 
’better* and those whose judgment is ’worse*. 


Correcter prognoses will generally issue from the judgments of those with 
better knowledge of mankind. 


Can one learn this knowledge? Yes; some can. Not, however, by taking a 
course in it, but through ’ experience .—Can someone else be a man’s teacher in 
this? Certainly. From time to time he gives him the right tip .—This is what 
learning and ’teaching™ are like here.— That one acquires here is not a 
technique; one learns correct judgments. There are also rules, but they do not 
form a system, and only ex perienced people can apply them right. Unlike 
calculating-rules. 


That is most difficult here is to put this indefiniteness, correctly and 
unfalsified, into words. 


“The genuineness of an expression cannot be proved; one has to feel it.”— 
Very well,—but what does one go on to do with this recognition of 
genuineness? Of someone says “Voila ce que peut dire un cceur vraiment 
6pris”—and if he also brings someone else to the same mind,—what are the 
further consequences? Or are there none, and does the game end with one 
person’s relishing what another does not? 


There are certainly consequences , but of a diffuse kind. Experience, that is 
varied observation, can inform us of them, and they too are incapable of 
general formulation; only in scattered cases can one arrive at a correct and 
fruitful judgment, establish a fruitful connexion. And the most general 
remarks yield at best what looks like the frag ments of a system. 


It is certainly possible to be convinced by evidence that someone is in such- 
and-such a state of mind, that, for instance, he is not pre tending. But 
‘evidence’ here includes ‘imponderable’ evidence. 


The question is: what does imponderable evidence accomplish ? 


Suppose there were imponderable evidence for the chemical (internal) 
structure of a substance, still it would have to prove itself to be evidence by 
certain consequences which can be weighed. 


(Imponderable evidence might convince someone that a picture was a 
genuine .... But it is possible for this to be proved right by docu mentary 
evidence as well.) 


Imponderable evidence includes subtleties of glance, of gesture, of tone. 


I may recognize a genuine loving look, distinguish it from a pretended one 
(and here there can, of course, be a ‘ponderable’ confirmation of my 
judgment). But I may be quite incapable of describing the difference. And 
this not because the languages I know have no words for it. For why not 
introduce new words?—If I were a very talented painter I might conceivably 
represent the genuine and the simulated glance in pictures. 


Ask yourself: How does a man learn to get a ‘nose’ for something? And how 
can this nose be used? 


Pretending is, of course, only a special case of someone’s producing (say) 
expressions of pain when he is not in pain. For if this is possible at all, why 
should it always be pretending that is taking place—this very special pattern 
in the weave of our lives? 


A child has much to learn before it can pretend. (A dog cannot be a 
hypocrite, but neither can he be sincere.) 


There might actually occur a case where we should say “This man believes he 
is pretending.”

If the formation of concepts can be explained by facts of nature, should we 
not be interested, not in grammar, but rather in that in nature which is the 
basis of grammar?—Our interest certainly includes the correspondence 
between concepts and very general facts of nature. (Such facts as mostly do 
not strike us because of their generality.) But our interest does not fall back 
upon these possible causes of die formation of concepts; we are not doing 
natural science; nor yet natural history—since we can also invent fictitious 
natural history for our purposes. 


I am not saying: if such-and-such facts of nature were different people would 
have different concepts (in the sense of a hypothesis). But: if anyone believes 
that certain concepts are absolutely the correct ones, and that having 
different ones would mean not realizing some thing that we realize—then let 
him imagine certain very general facts of nature to be different from what we 
are used to, and the formation of concepts different from the usual ones will 
become intelligible to him. 


Compare a concept with a style of painting. For is even our style of painting 
arbitrary? Can we choose one at pleasure? (The Egyptian, for instance.) Is it a 
mere question of pleasing and ugly? 


X111 


When I say: “He was here half an hour ago”—that is, remembering it—this is 
not the description of a present experience. 


Memory-experiences are accompaniments of remembering. 


Remembering has no experiential content.—Surely this can be seen by 
introspection? Doesn’t it shew precisely that there is nothing there, when I 
look about for a content?—But it could only shew this in this case or that. 
And even so it cannot shew me what the word “to remember” means, and 
hence where to look for a content. 


I get the idea of a memory-content only because I assimilate psychological 
concepts. It is like assimilating two games. (Football has goals, tennis not.) 


Would this situation be conceivable: someone remembers for the first time in 
his life and says “Yes, now I know what ‘remembering’ is, what it feels like to 
remember”.—How does he know that this feeling is ‘remembering’? 
Compare: “Yes, now I know what ‘tingling’ is”. (He has perhaps had an 
electric shock for the first time.)—Does he know that it is memory because it 
is caused by something past? And how does he know what the past is? Can 
learns the concept of the past by remembering. 


And how will he know again in the future what remembering feels like? 


(On the other hand one might, perhaps, speak of a feeling “Long, long ago”, 
for there is a tone, a gesture, which go with certain narratives of past times.)

The confusion and barrenness of psychology is not to be explained by calling 
it a “young science”; its state is not comparable with that of physics, for 
instance, in its beginnings. (Rather with that of certain branches of 
mathematics. Set theory.) For in psychology there are experimental methods 
and conceptual confusion . (As in the other case conceptual confusion and 
methods of proof.) 


The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means 
of solving the problems which trouble us; though problem and method pass 
one another by. 


In investigation is possible in connexion with mathematics which is entirely 
analogous to our investigation of psychology. It is just as little a 
mathematical investigation as the other is a psychological one. It will not 
contain calculations, so it is not for example logistic. It might deserve the 
name of an investigation of the ‘foundations of mathematics’.
