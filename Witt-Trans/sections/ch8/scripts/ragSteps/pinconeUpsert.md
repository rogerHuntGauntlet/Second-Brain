Below is an example of how you can build a simple Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Pinecone as your vector database. In this example, we’ll:

1. **Embed your data:** Convert your documents into vector embeddings (using OpenAI’s embeddings, for example).
2. **Create/Upsert your Pinecone index:** Store the embeddings along with metadata.
3. **Query the index:** Retrieve relevant documents based on a query by converting that query into an embedding and searching the index.
4. **Generate output:** (Optionally) feed the retrieved context along with your query into a language model for generation.

> **Note:** You’ll need to have active accounts (or API keys) for both Pinecone and an embedding service (like OpenAI’s) and install the required libraries (e.g., `pinecone-client` and `openai`).

Below is a sample Python script showing one way to set up this pipeline.

### Sample Code: `rag_pipeline.py`

```python:rag_pipeline.py
import os
import pinecone
import openai

# Set up your API keys (ensure these are set in your environment variables or replace directly)
PINECONE_API_KEY = os.getenv("PINECONE_API_KEY")
PINECONE_ENV = os.getenv("PINECONE_ENV")  # e.g., "us-west1-gcp"
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY

# Initialize Pinecone client
pinecone.init(api_key=PINECONE_API_KEY, environment=PINECONE_ENV)

# Define index name and embedding dimension (1536 is the dimension for "text-embedding-ada-002")
index_name = "rag-index"
if index_name not in pinecone.list_indexes():
    pinecone.create_index(index_name, dimension=1536)

# Connect to the Pinecone index
index = pinecone.Index(index_name)

def embed_text(text):
    """
    Convert a piece of text into an embedding vector using OpenAI's embedding endpoint.
    """
    response = openai.Embedding.create(
        input=[text],
        model="text-embedding-ada-002"
    )
    embedding = response["data"][0]["embedding"]
    return embedding

def upsert_documents(documents):
    """
    Embed each document and upsert into the Pinecone index.
    
    Each vector is stored with a unique id and optional metadata.
    """
    vectors = []
    for idx, doc in enumerate(documents):
        embedding = embed_text(doc)
        meta = {"text": doc}  # you can add more metadata if needed
        vectors.append((str(idx), embedding, meta))
    index.upsert(vectors)
    print(f"Upserted {len(vectors)} documents into the index.")

def query_index(query_text, top_k=5):
    """
    Convert the query text into an embedding and retrieve the top_k most similar documents.
    """
    query_embedding = embed_text(query_text)
    query_result = index.query(queries=[query_embedding], top_k=top_k, include_metadata=True)
    return query_result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example documents to upsert
    documents = [
        "Pinecone is a vector database that makes it easy to work with embeddings.",
        "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves responses by incorporating relevant documents.",
        "OpenAI provides powerful language models and embedding models like text-embedding-ada-002.",
        # Add more documents as needed...
    ]
    
    # Upsert documents into the index
    upsert_documents(documents)
    
    # Querying the index
    sample_query = "How can I use Pinecone for retrieval augmented generation?"
    results = query_index(sample_query)
    
    print("Query Results:")
    for match in results["results"][0]["matches"]:
        print(f"Score: {match['score']}, Document: {match['metadata']['text']}")
```

### How It Works

1. **Embedding Documents:**  
   The `embed_text` function uses OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002` model to convert text into a numerical embedding. These embeddings capture semantic information about the text.

2. **Storing Data in Pinecone:**  
   The `upsert_documents` function processes a list of documents, generating embeddings for each, and then upserts (inserts/updates) them into your Pinecone index. Each vector is saved with a unique ID and some metadata (here, just the original text).

3. **Querying the Index:**  
   When a user query is given, `query_index` converts the query into an embedding and performs a similarity search within the Pinecone index. It returns the top matching documents along with their similarity scores and metadata.

4. **Next Steps in a RAG Workflow:**  
   Once you have the relevant documents from Pinecone, you can feed them as context to your LLM (like GPT-3.5/4) to generate a customized answer.

### Final Notes

- **Environment Setup:** Make sure your environment variables (`PINECONE_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_ENV`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY`) are correctly configured.
- **Dependencies:** Install required packages if you haven’t already:
  ```bash
  pip install pinecone-client openai
  ```
- **Extensions:** This is a basic example. Depending on your requirements, you might want to add error handling, batch processing, or more sophisticated metadata management.

This should give you a good starting point for building a RAG pipeline on Pinecone using your data! If you have any other questions or need further customization, feel free to ask.
