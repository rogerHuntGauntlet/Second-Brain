Ludwig Wittgenstein

Note


1. W. James: the thought is already complete at the beginning of the sentence. How can one know that? - But the intention to say it can already exist before the first word is said. For if you ask someone "do you know what you want to say?" he will often say yes.

2. I say to someone "I am now going to whistle the topic ....", I intend to whistle it and I already know what I am going to whistle.

I intend to whistle this topic: have I thereby already whistled it in my mind in some sense?

3. "I 'm not just saying that, I mean something by it." - Should we ask "What?" - Then another sentence comes to answer. - Or can we not ask like that, since the sentence said something like "I'm not just saying that, it also moves me."

4. (One of the most misleading ways of speaking is to ask "What do I mean by that?" – In most cases, one could answer "Nothing at all – I say ....".)

5. Can't I mean what I want with words? –– Look at the door of your room, say a series of random sounds, and mean by this a description of this door!

6. "Say 'abcd' and mean by that: the weather is nice." - Should I then say that pronouncing a sentence in a language we are familiar with is a completely different experience to pronouncing sounds which are not familiar to us as a sentence? If I were to learn the language in which " abcd " has that meaning, would I gradually get the experience we are familiar with when pronouncing these letters? Yes and no. - A major difference between the two cases is that in the first case I cannot move . It is as if one of my joints were in splints and I was not yet used to them and had not yet grasped the possible movements, so to speak, I was constantly bumping into things.

7. If I have two friends with the same name and I write a letter to one of them, why am I not writing it to the other? The content? But it could be suitable for both. (I haven't written the address yet.) Well, the connection can lie in the history. But then also in what follows the letter . If someone asks me "Which of the two are you writing to?" and I answer him, do I deduce the answer from the history? Am I not giving it almost like I say "I have a toothache"? - Could I be in doubt as to which of the two I am writing to? And what does such a case of doubt look like? - Yes, isn't the case of deception also possible: I think I am writing to one and write to the other? And what would the case of such a deception look like?

8. (Sometimes we say: "What was I looking for in this drawer? - Ah yes, the photograph!" And when we think of this, we remember the connection between our action and what came before. But it could also be the case that I open the drawer and rummage around in it; finally I come to my senses, as it were, and ask myself "Why am I looking around in this drawer?" And then the answer comes: "I want to see the photograph of ...." "I want ," not "I wanted ." The opening of the drawer etc. happened automatically, so to speak, and was subsequently interpreted.)

9. "I wanted to hit him with that remark." When I hear that, I can imagine a situation and its story. I could act it out on the stage, put myself in the state of mind in which I want to hit him. - But how can this state of mind be described? In other words, identified? - I imagine myself in the situation, adopt a certain expression and voice, etc. What connects my words with him? The situation and my thoughts. And my thoughts are no different from the words I speak.

10. Suppose I wanted to replace all the words in my language with others at once; how could I know where one of the new words is? Are ideas what determine the places of the words?

11. I am inclined to say: I 'point'  in various senses to this body, to its shape, to its colour, etc. – What does that mean?

What does it mean: I 'hear'  in another sense : the piano, its sound, the piece of music, the pianist, his fluency? I 'marry' a woman in one sense, her money in another.

12. Here, meaning is imagined as a kind of spiritual showing, hinting.

13. In some spiritualistic actions it is essential that one thinks of a particular person . And here we have the impression that 'thinking of him' is like impaling him with my thoughts. Or it is as if I am constantly stabbing him with my thoughts. For they always wander away from him a little.

14. "I suddenly had to think of him." His image suddenly appeared before my eyes. Did I know that it was his, N.'s image? I didn't tell myself. So what made it seem like it was his? Perhaps it was something I said or did later.

15. When Max says "The prince takes fatherly care of the troops," he means Wallenstein. - Suppose someone said: We don't know whether he means Wallenstein; he could also mean another prince in this sentence.

16. "The fact that you meant playing the piano consisted in the fact that you were thinking about playing the piano ."

"The fact that you meant this person with the word 'you' in this letter consisted in the fact that you were writing to him ."

The error is to say that mine consists in something.

17. "When I said that, I only wanted to give him a hint." - How can I know that I only said it to give him a hint? Well, the words "When I said it, etc." describe a specific situation that we understand. What does the situation look like? In order to describe it, I have to describe a context.

18. How does he enter into these processes:

I stabbed him,

I said to him,

I called him,

I spoke of him,

I imagined him,

I respect him?

19. It is wrong to say: I meant him when I looked at him. "Meaning" does not mean an activity that consists wholly or partly in the "manifestations" of meaning.

20. It would therefore be foolish to call opinion a ›mental activity‹, because this would encourage a false idea of ​​the function of the word.

21. I say "Come here!" and point in the direction of A. B, who is standing next to him, takes a step towards me. I say: "No; A should come." Will this be understood as a report about my mental processes? Certainly not. - And could one not draw conclusions from this about processes that took place in me when I uttered the command "Come here!"?

But what kind of processes? Couldn't one assume that I was looking at A when I gave my order; that my train of thought led me to him? But perhaps I don't know B at all, and am only connected with A. Then whoever assumed my mental processes could have been completely mistaken, and still have understood that I meant A and not B.

22. I point with my hand and say "Come here!". A asks "Did you mean me?" I say "No; B." - What happened when I meant B (since my pointing left it doubtful who I meant)? - I said these words, made this hand gesture. Did anything else have to happen for the language game to take place? But didn't I already know who I meant while pointing? Knew? Of course - according to the usual criteria of knowledge.

23. "I wanted to aim for ..." in my explanation. I had this goal in mind. I saw in my mind the place in the book that I was aiming for.

Describing the intention means describing what happened from a certain point of view, for a certain purpose. I paint a specific portrait of the events.

24. Instead of "I meant him ," you can also say "I spoke about him ." And how do you do that: speak about him with these words ? Why does it sound wrong to say "I spoke about him by pointing to him with these words"?

"To mean him" means, for example, to speak of him. Not to point to him. And when I speak of him , there is of course a connection between my speech and him, but this connection lies in the application of speech, not in an act of pointing. Pointing is itself only a sign, and in the language game it can regulate the application of sentences, that is, indicate what is meant.

25. When I say "I saw an armchair in this room," I can usually only remember the particular visual image very casually, and in most cases it has no meaning at all. The use made of the sentence ignores this particularity. Is it the same when I say "I meant N"? Does this sentence ignore the particularities of the event in the same way?

26. If I allude to N in a remark, this may – under certain circumstances – be apparent from my look, facial expression, etc.

You can show that you understand the expression "allude to N" by describing examples of allusion. What will you describe? First of all, circumstances. Then what someone says. Perhaps also their look, etc. Then what the person alluding wants to do.

And if I also share my feelings, ideas, etc. with someone while I was making this remark (during this allusion), these may complete the typical picture of the allusion (or such a picture). But it does not follow from this that the expression "allude to N" means: to behave like this, to feel this, to imagine this, etc. And here some will say: "Of course not! We have always seen that. And there must be a common thread running through all these phenomena. It is, so to speak, woven around them and therefore difficult to find." - And that is not true either.

But it would also be wrong to say that "alluding" describes a family of mental and other processes. For one can certainly ask "What was your allusion to N?", "How did you let others understand that you meant N?", but not "How did you mean this statement as an allusion to N?"

"I alluded to him in my speech." - "In what words?" - "I alluded to him when I spoke of a man who...".

"I was alluding to him" means roughly: I wanted someone to think of him when I said these words. But "I wanted" is not a description of a state of mind, and "to understand that N was meant" is not one either.

27. If the situation is ambiguous, is it then doubtful whether I mean him? When I say that I meant him or not, I am not judging according to the situation. And if I am not judging according to the situation, what am I judging according to? Apparently, nothing at all. Because I remember the situation, but I interpret it. For example, I can now imitate my sideways glance at him , but the meaning appears as a completely intangible, subtle atmosphere of speaking and acting. (A suspicious image!)

28. In the course of a conversation I want to point to something; I have already made the beginning of a pointing gesture, but I do not carry it out. Later I say: "I wanted to point to that at the time. I still remember clearly that I had already raised my finger." In the stream of these processes, thoughts and feelings, this was the beginning of a gesture of pointing.

Yes, if I made the whole gesture and said, "He is lying over there," that would not be a showing if these words did not belong to a language.

29. "You made a gesture with your hand; did you mean something by it? - I thought you meant that I should come to you."

So he could mean something or he could mean nothing. And if the former, then his hand gesture, or something else? Did he mean something other than this with his expression, or did he just mean his expression ?

30. Could one also answer: "I meant something with this movement that I can only express through this movement"? (Music, musical thought.)

31. “I certainly thought of him: I saw him before me!” – But I did not recognize him in his image .

32. Imagine one of your acquaintances! Now tell me who it was! Sometimes the picture comes first and the name afterward. But can I guess the name from the resemblance to the picture? And if the name comes after the picture, was the idea of ​​that person already there with the picture, or was it only complete with the name? I did not deduce the name from the picture; and that is precisely why I can say that the idea of ​​him came with the picture.

33. It is as if one were experiencing a tendency , a readiness (James). And why should I not call it that? (And some would also explain what happens there by innervations of muscles, beginnings of movements or even ideas about them.) But you must not view the experience of a tendency under the image of an experience that is not quite complete.

It often seems to us that the mind, in understanding meaning, makes small rudimentary movements, like an undecided person who does not know which way to go - that is, it goes beyond the area of ​​possible applications.

34. Imagine people who, from childhood onwards, scribble with great speed while they talk: illustrating, as it were, what they say.

Must I assume that someone who draws or describes or imitates something from imagination or memory is basing his representation on something else ?! – What speaks for this?

35. Guessing thoughts. Playing cards are lying on a table. I want the other person to touch one of them. I close my eyes and think of one of these cards; the other person has to guess which one I mean. He then comes up with a card and wishes to agree with me. He touches the card and I say "Yes, that was it," or it wasn't. A variation of this game would be for me to look at a certain card , but in such a way that the other person cannot see the direction of my gaze, and then he has to guess which card I am looking at. The fact that this is a variation of the first game is important. It can be important here how I think of the card, because it could turn out that the reliability of the guess depends on it. But if in everyday life I say "I was just thinking of N," I am not asked " How did you think of him?"

36. One might ask: "Would anyone who could see into your inner self have seen that you wanted to say that ?"

Suppose I had written down my resolution on a piece of paper, someone else could have read my resolution there. And can I imagine that he could have found out about it in any more certain way than this? Certainly not.

37. (The composer has written above a piece of musicnote 37.png= 88, but to play it correctly today it mustnote 37.pngbe played = 94: what is the tempo intended by the composer ?)

38. Interrupt a person who is speaking completely unprepared and fluently. Then ask him what he wanted to say, and in many cases he will be able to continue the sentence he had started. - "He must have already had in mind what he wanted to say." - Is not that phenomenon perhaps the reason why we say that he had in mind the continuation?

39. But isn't it strange that there is such a reaction, such a confession of intention? Isn't it a very strange language instrument? What is actually strange about it? Well, it is difficult to imagine how people learn to use words in this way. It is so subtle.

40. But is it really more subtle than that of the words "I imagined it," for example? Yes, every such use of language is strange, odd, if one is only interested in the descriptions of physical objects.

41. If I say, "I wanted to do such and such at that time," and this statement is based on the thoughts, ideas, etc. that I remember, then someone else, to whom I only communicate these thoughts, ideas, etc., must be able to conclude with equal certainty that I wanted to do such and such at that time. But he often cannot do that. Indeed, if I were to conclude my intention from this evidence, the other person would rightly say that this conclusion is very uncertain.

42. And how does [the child] learn to use the expression "I was then about to throw"? And how does one know that he was then really in that state of mind which I call "being about to..."?

43. What if a person never used the expression "I was then about to..." or "I then wanted to..." and could not learn to use it? Man can think a lot without thinking that . He can master a large area of ​​language games without mastering this one.

But is it not strange that we do not encounter people who are defective in this way, despite all the diversity of people? Or are these people found among the mentally retarded, and it is just that not enough attention is paid to the uses of language they are capable of and those they are not?

44. "I had the intention ...." does not express the memory of an experience. (Just as little as: "I was about to ....")

45. Intention is neither an emotion, a mood, a sensation, nor an idea. It is not a state of consciousness. It has no real duration.

46. ​​"I intend to travel tomorrow." - When do you intend to travel? All the time; or intermittently?

47. Look into the chest where you think you will find it. The chest is empty. – I think you have been looking for it among the sensations.

Consider what it actually means to have an intention intermittently. It would mean something like: having the intention, dropping it, picking it up again, etc.

48. Under what circumstances does one say, "This device is a brake, but it does not work"? That means, it does not fulfil its purpose. What is it that makes it have this purpose? One could also say, "It was intended that this should work as a brake." Whose intention? Here the intention as a state of the soul completely escapes us.

Couldn't one also imagine that several people could have an intention and carry it out without any of them having it? In the same way, a government can have an intention that no one has.

49. There could be a verb which means to express one's intention by words or other signs, either aloud or in one's mind. This verb would not be equivalent to our "intend".

There could be a verb which means to act according to an intention; and this would not be equivalent to our "intend".

Another could mean: to brood over an intention; or to turn it over in one's head.

50. One can disturb someone while they are thinking, but while they are intending? –– While they are planning, yes. Also while they are holding to an intention, namely in thinking or acting.

51. Application of the imperative. Compare the commands:

Raise your arm!

Imagine!

Calculate.....in your head!

Think about it.....!

Focus your attention on .....!

Think of this figure as a cube!

with these:

Intend .....!

My with these words .....!

I suspect that this is the case!

Believe it is so!

Be firmly convinced.....!

Remember that this happened!

Doubt whether it happened!

Hope for his return!

Is the difference that the first are voluntary movements of the mind, the second involuntary? I can rather say that the verbs in the second group do not denote actions. (Compare this with the command: "Laugh heartily at this joke!")

52. Can you command someone to understand a sentence? Why can't you command someone to "understand this!"? Couldn't I obey the command "understand this Greek sentence!" by learning Greek? –– Similarly, you can say "cause yourself to have pain!" but not "have pain!" You can say "put yourself in this state!" but not "be in this state!"

53. I expect an explosion at any moment. I am unable to give my full attention to anything else; I look at a book, but without reading. When asked why I seem distracted or nervous, I say that I am expecting an explosion at any moment. – So how was it: did this sentence describe precisely that behavior? But how does the process of expecting an explosion differ from the process of expecting a completely different event, e.g. a certain signal? And how does the expectation of a signal differ from the expectation of a slightly different signal? Or was my behavior only a side effect of the actual expectation, and this a special mental process? And was this process homogeneous or structured like a sentence (with an internal beginning and end)? But how does the person in whom it occurs know which event the process is the expectation of? He does not seem to be in any doubt about it. It is not as if he were ascertaining a mental or other state and making a guess about its cause. He may well say, "I don't know if it is just this expectation that is making me so restless today," but he will not say, "I don't know if this state of mind I am in now is the expectation of an explosion, or of something else."

The statement "I'm expecting a bang at any moment" is an expression of expectation. This verbal reaction is the deflection of the pointer that indicates the object of expectation.

54. It seems that the expectation and the fact that satisfies the expectation somehow fit together. Now let us describe an expectation and a fact that fit together, so that we can see what this fit consists of. We immediately think of the fit of a solid form into a corresponding hollow form. But if we want to describe these two, we see that, insofar as they fit, one description applies to both. (Compare, on the other hand, what it means to say "These trousers don't fit with this skirt.")

55. Like everything metaphysical, the harmony between thought and reality is to be found in the grammar of language.

56. My thought here is: If someone could see the expectation itself, he would have to see what is expected. (But in such a way that there would be no need for a method of projection or comparison in order to arrive at the fact that is expected from what he sees.)

But that’s how it is: whoever sees the expression of expectation sees ‘what is expected’.

57. The thought that only finding something shows us what we were looking for, only the fulfillment of a wish shows us what we have desired, means judging the process in the same way as the symptoms of expectation or searching in another person. I see him walking restlessly up and down in his room; then someone comes in the door and he becomes calm and gives signs of satisfaction. And now I say, "He has obviously been expecting this person."

58. We say that the expression of expectation 'describes' the expected fact and think of it as an object or complex that appears as the fulfillment of the expectation. – But what is expected is not the fulfillment, but rather: that it comes.

The error is deeply rooted in our language: we say "I await him" and "I await his coming" and "I expect him to come".

59. It is difficult for us to get away from the comparison: the person enters – the event occurs. As if the event had already been prefigured at the door of reality and was now entering it (like into a room).

60. Reality is not a quality that is still lacking in what is expected and which is added when the expectation occurs. Nor is reality like daylight, which only gives colour to things when they are already colourless in the dark.

61. One can say of the bearer of a name that he does not exist; and that is of course not an activity, although one could compare it to one and say that he must be there if he does not exist. (And that has certainly been written by a philosopher before.)

62. The shadowy anticipation of the fact consists in the fact that we can now think that what is yet to happen will happen . Or, as it is misleadingly put: that we can now think that (or of that) what is yet to happen .

63. Some people may perhaps want to say, "Expectation is a thought." This obviously corresponds to a use of the word "expect." And we will just remember that the process of thoughtcan be very different .

64. I whistle, and someone asks me why I am in a good mood. I answer, "I hope N will come today." But while I was whistling, I was not thinking of him. And yet it would be wrong to say that I stopped hoping when I started whistling.

65. When I say "I expect..." - is that the statement: the situation, my actions, thoughts, etc. are those of the expectation of this event; or do the words "I expect..." belong to the process of expectation?

Under certain circumstances, these words will be (can be replaced by) "I believe that such and such will happen." Sometimes also: "Be prepared for the fact that..."

66. The psychological – trivial – discussions about expectation, association, etc., always leave out the really remarkable thing, and one notices that they talk around things without touching on the crucial point.

67. An expectation is embedded in a situation from which it arises. The expectation of an explosion can arise, for example, from a situation in which an explosion is to be expected . The person who is expecting an explosion heard two people whispering: "Tomorrow at ten o'clock the fuse will be lit." Then he thinks: perhaps someone wants to blow up a house here. Around ten o'clock he becomes restless, jumps at every noise, and finally, when asked why he is nervous, he answers: "I expect...". This answer will, for example, make his behavior understandable. It will also enable us to imagine his thoughts and feelings.

68. The fulfillment of the expectation does not consist in the fact that a third thing happens, which one could describe in some other way than just as "the fulfillment of this expectation," for example as a feeling of satisfaction or joy or whatever. The expectation that something will be the case is the same as the expectation of the fulfillment of that expectation. [ Marginal note: expectation of what is not.]

69. Socrates to Theaetetus: "And whoever imagines, shouldn't he imagine something ?" – Th.: "Necessarily." – Socrates: "And whoever imagines something, shouldn't he imagine something real?" – Th.: "So it seems."

If we use the word "kill" instead of the word "imagine" in this argument, there is a rule for the use of this word: it makes no sense to say "I kill something that does not exist." I can imagine a deer in this meadow that is not there, but I cannot kill one that is not there. And "imagining a deer in this meadow" means imagining that a deer is there. But killing a deer does not mean killing that, etc. But if someone says "In order for me to be able to imagine a deer, it must exist in a certain sense" - the answer is: no, it must not exist in any sense. And if the answer were: "But the brown color, for example, must exist in order for me to be able to imagine it," then to say "the brown color exists" means nothing at all; except that it is present here or there as the coloring of an object; and that is not necessary for me to be able to imagine a brown deer.

70. Being able to do something appears like a shadow of the actual doing, just as the meaning of a sentence is the shadow of a fact, or the understanding of an order is the shadow of its execution. In the order, the fact casts, as it were, "its shadow in advance." But this shadow, whatever it might be, is not the event.

71. Compare the applications of:

"I've been in pain since yesterday."

"I've been expecting him since yesterday."

"I knew since yesterday."

»I have been able to integrate since yesterday.«

72. The common difference between all states of consciousness and dispositions seems to me to be that one cannot convince oneself by spot checks whether they still persist.

73. You have to read some sentences several times to understand them as a sentence.

74. A sentence is given to me in a cipher and also its key; then of course everything I need to understand the sentence is given to me in one respect. And yet, if I were asked, "Do you understand this sentence?", I would answer: No, not yet; I must first decipher it. And only when I have translated it into German, for example, would I say, "Now I understand it."

If one now asks the question “At what moment of the transfer do I understand the sentence?”, one would gain insight into the nature of what we call “understanding”.

75. I can pay attention to the course of my pain, but not to that of my faith, my translation, or my knowledge.

76. The duration of a phenomenon can be determined by continuous observation or by testing. The observation of duration can be continuous or interrupted.

77. How do I observe my knowledge, my opinions? And on the other hand, an afterimage, a pain? Is there a continuous observation of my ability to perform multiplication...?

78. Is "I hope..." a description of a state of mind? A state of mind has a duration. "I have been hoping all day..." is such a description. But if I say to someone "I hope you will come" - as if he asked me "How long do you hope?" Is the answer "I hope while I say it"? Supposing I had any answer to this question, would it not be quite irrelevant to the purpose of the words "I hope you will come"?

79. One says, "I hope you will come," but not, "I believe I hope you will come," but it would be possible to say, "I believe I still hope he will come."

80. What is the past tense of “You’re coming, aren’t you?”

81. Where there is real duration, one can say to someone: "Pay attention and give me a sign when the image, the experience, the sound, etc. changes."

There is a kind of paying attention. While one cannot follow the forgetting of what was known and the like with attention. [ Side note: Not true, because one cannot follow one's own ideas with attention either.]

82. Think of the language game: Use the stopwatch to determine how long the impression lasts. You could not determine the duration of knowledge, ability, and understanding in this way.

83. "But the difference between knowing and hearing does not lie in such a simple characteristic as the nature of their duration. They are completely and fundamentally different!" Of course. But one cannot say: " Know and hear , and you will notice the difference!"

84. "Pain is a state of consciousness, understanding is not." - "Well, Ijust don't feel understanding." - But this explanation is useless. It would also not be an explanation to say: what one feels in any sense is a state of consciousness. That would only mean: state of consciousness = feeling. (One would only have replaced one word with another.)

85. One hardly ever says that one has believed, understood or intended something "uninterruptedly" since yesterday. An interruption of belief would be a period of disbelief, not, for example, the turning away of attention from what is believed, such as sleep.

(Difference between ›knowing‹ ​​and ›being aware of‹.)

86. The most important thing here is this: there is a difference; one notices the difference 'which is a categorical one' - without being able to say what it consists in. This is the case in which one usually says that one notices the difference precisely through introspection.

87. This is probably the point at which one says that one can only communicate the form to another , but not the content. – So one speaks to oneself about the content . –– But how do my words 'relate' to the content that I am conscious of? And for what purpose?

88. It is very strange that the processes of thinking hardly ever interest us. It is strange, but not odd.

89. (Thoughts, just hints, so to speak.)

Isn't it like the art calculator? - He has calculated correctly if the result is correct. He himself may not be able to say what was going on in his mind. And if we heard it, it might seem like a strange caricature of a calculation.

90. What do I know about the inner processes of someone who reads a sentence attentively? And can he describe them to me after he has done so; and is what he describes precisely the characteristic process of attention?

91. Question: What effect do I want to achieve when I tell someone "Read carefully!"? Perhaps that he notices this or that and can report on it. - Again, I think one could say that someone who reads a sentence attentively will often be able to report on processes in his mind, ideas, for example. But that does not mean that these processes are called "attention."

92. "Did you read the sentence carefully?" - "Yes, I read it carefully; every word was important to me."

This is not the usual experience. One does not usually hear oneself speaking in a state of half-surprise; one does not follow one's own speech with attention; for one usually speaks voluntarily, not involuntarily.

93. If an otherwise normal person were having a normal conversation under normal circumstances, and I were asked how the thinker differed from the non-thinker in such a case, –– I would not know how to answer. And I certainly could not say that the difference lies in something that was or was not happening during the conversation.

94. The boundary line between 'thinking' and 'not thinking' that would be drawn here would run between two states that are not distinguished from a play of ideas by anything even remotely resembling that of a play of ideas. (For the play of ideas is, after all, the model by which one would like to imagine thinking.)

95. Only under very special circumstances does the question arise whether or not the speech was thoughtful.

96. Yes, if one speaks of an experience of thinking, then the experience of speaking is as good as any other. But the concept of 'thinking' is not an experiential concept. For one does not compare thoughts as one compares experiences.

97. What one imitates is the tone of speech, the expression, and the like, and that is enough for us. This proves that here lie the important accompanying phenomena of speech.

98. Let us say that everyone who speaks meaningfully thinks? For example, the builder in language game No.2 ? Could we not imagine the building and calling of words etc. in an environment in which we did not associate it in the remotest way with thinking?

99. (On Language Game No.2 ) "You are already tacitly assuming that these people think ; that in this respect they are like the people we know; that they are not playing that language game purely mechanically. For if you imagined that they did it, you yourself would not call it the use of a rudimentary language."

What should I say to that? It is of course true that the lives of those people must resemble ours in many respects, and I have said nothing about these similarities. But the important thing is that their language, as well as their thinking, can be rudimentary, that there is a 'primitive thinking' which can be described by primitive behavior . The environment is not the 'thinking accompaniment' to speaking.

100. Let us imagine that someone is doing a job that involves comparing, trying and choosing. He is making an object of daily use out of certain pieces of material using given tools. The question "Should I use this piece?" keeps coming up. The piece is rejected and another is tried. Pieces are put together and taken apart for testing purposes; a suitable one is sought, etc., etc. I now imagine this whole process being filmed. The worker also makes noises such as "hm" or "ha!" Sounds of hesitation, of sudden discovery, of decision, of satisfaction, of dissatisfaction, so to speak. But not a word is spoken. Those sounds can be recorded on film. The film is shown to me and I invent a monologue by the worker that fits in with his way of working, the rhythm of his work, his facial expressions, his gestures and natural sounds, which corresponds to all of this. So sometimes I let him say, "No, the piece is too long, maybe another one would be better." –– Or "What should I do now?" –– "I've got it!" –– Or "That's quite good," etc.

If the worker can talk, would it be a falsification of the real process if he were to describe it precisely and say, for example, "Then I thought: No, that won't work; I must try it another way," etc., even though he had not spoken during the work and had not even imagined these words?

What I mean is: Can he not later express his wordless thoughts in words? In such a way that we, who see the process of work, could agree with this expression? - All the more so if we had seen the man at work not just once, but often?

101. We could not, of course, separate his 'thinking' from his activity. Thinking is not an accompaniment to work, any more than it is to thoughtful speech.

102. If we saw beings at work whose rhythm of work , facial expressions, etc. were similar to ours, except that they did not speak , then we would perhaps say that they were thinking, reflecting, making decisions. There would be a lot there that corresponds to the actions of ordinary people. And it is not possible to decide how exactly the correspondence must be in order for us to have a right to apply the term 'thinking' to them too.

103. And why should we make this decision?

We shall make an important distinction between beings who can learn to perform a task, even a complicated one, 'mechanically' and those who try and compare while working. But what is called 'trying' and 'comparing' I can only explain with examples, and these examples will be taken from our life or from one similar to ours.

104. If he has made a combination by play or by chance and now uses it as a method of doing this or that, we will say that he is thinking. - When thinking, he would let means and ways pass before his mind's eye. But for that to happen, he must already have some in stock. Thinking gives him the opportunity to perfect his methods. Or rather: he 'thinks' when he perfects his method in a certain way. [ Marginal note: What does research look like?]

105. One could also say: someone thinks when he learns in a certain way .

106. And this too (one could say): Anyone who thinks while workingwill often incorporate auxiliary activities into it. The word "think" does not designate these auxiliary activities, just as thinking is not speaking. Although the concept of "thinking" is formed in the manner of an imaginary auxiliary activity. (Just as one could say that the concept of the differential quotient is formed in the manner of an ideal quotient.)

107. These auxiliary activities are not thought; but thought is imagined as the current which must flow beneath the surface of these auxiliary activities if they are not to be mere mechanical actions.

108. Suppose we are dealing with beings (human-like animals) that we use as slaves, buy and sell. They cannot learn to speak, but the more gifted among them can be trained to do often very complicated work; and some of these work 'thinkingly', others merely mechanically. We pay more for a thinker than for someone who is merely mechanically skilled.

109. If there were only a very few people who could find the answer to an arithmetic problem without speaking or writing, one could not cite them as evidence that one could calculate without symbols. Because it would not be clear that these people 'calculate' at all. Likewise, Ballard's testimony (in James) cannot convince one that one can think without language.

Yes, why should one speak of 'thinking' when no language is needed? If one does so, it reveals something about the concept of thinking.

110. 'Thinking' is a widely branched concept. A concept that combines many expressions of life. The phenomena of thought lie far apart.

111. We are not at all prepared for the task ofdescribing the use of the word "think," for example. (And why should we be? What is the use of such a description?)

And the naive idea that we have of it does not correspond to reality at all. We expect a smooth, regular contour and what we see is a torn one. Here you could really say that we have formed a false image.

112. This word is not to be expected to have a uniform use; rather, the opposite is to be expected.

113. Where do we get the concept 'think' that we want to consider here? From everyday language. What first directs our attention is the word 'think'. But the use of this word is confused. And we cannot expect anything else. And that can of course be said of all psychological verbs. Their use is not as clear and as easy to overlook as that of the words of mechanics, for example.

114. One learns the word "think," that is, its use, under certain circumstances, which one does not learn to describe.

115. But I can teach a man the use of the word! For that does not require a description of those circumstances.

116. I am just teaching him the Word under certain circumstances .

117. One learns to say it, to assert it or to deny it, only from humans. The question "Does a fish think?" does not exist among its linguistic uses, is not asked . (What could be more natural than such a state, such a use of language?)

118. "Nobody thought of this case" - one can say. I cannot, of course, enumerate the conditions under which the word "think" is to be used - but if a circumstance makes its use doubtful, I can say so and also how the situation differs from the usual one.

119. If I have learned to carry out a certain activity in a certain room (for example, tidying the room) and have mastered this technique, it does not follow that I must be ready to describe the furnishings of the room; even if I would immediately notice every change in it and could also describe it immediately.

120. "This law was not given in anticipation of such cases." Does that make it meaningless?

121. It is certainly conceivable that someone could know a city inside out, that is, that he could find the shortest route from any place in the city to any other, and yet be completely unable to draw a map of the city. That, as soon as he tries, he will only produce something completely wrong . (Our concept of 'instinct'.)

122. Consider that our language could have different words: for 'thinking out loud'; for thinking soliloquies in the imagination; for pausing while thinking of something but after which we can give the answer with certainty.

One word for the thought that is expressed in the sentence; one for the flash of thought that I can later 'clothe in words'; one for the thinking work without words.

123. "Thinking is a mental activity." -- Thinking is not a physical activity. Is thinking an activity? Well, you can order someone to "think about it." But if someone speaks to himself or to another person in response to this order, is he performing two activities?

124. Participation in what is being said has its specific signs. It also has its specific consequences and preconditions. Participation is something experienced: one says it of oneself, not on the basis of observation. It is not an accompaniment to what is being said. How could what accompanies the sentence be participation in the content of this sentence? (Logical condition.)

125. Compare the phenomenon of thinking with the phenomenon of burning! Can not burning, the flame, appear mysterious to us? And why the flame more than the table? –– And how do you explain this mystery?

And how is the riddle of thought to be solved? – How is that of the flame?

126. Isn't the flame mysterious because it is intangible? Yes, but why does that make it mysterious? Why should the intangible be more mysterious than the tangible? Except because we want to grasp it .

127. They say that the soul leaves the body. But then, in order to take away all resemblance to the body, and to avoid thinking that it is some gaseous thing, they say that the soul is incorporeal, non-spatial; but the word "leaves" says it all. Show me how you use the word "mental," and I will see whether the soul is "incorporeal," and what you mean by "spirit."

128. I am inclined to speak of the lifeless as something that lacks something. I definitely see life as a plus, as something added to the lifeless. (Psychological atmosphere.)

129. Man sagt vom Tisch und Stuhl nicht: »er denkt jetzt«, noch »er denkt jetzt nicht«, noch »er denkt nie«; auch von der Pflanze nicht, auch vom Fisch nicht, kaum vom Hund; aber vom Menschen. Und auch nicht von allen Menschen.

»Ein Tisch denkt nicht« ist nicht vergleichbar einer Aussage wie »ein Tisch wächst nicht«. (Ich wüßte gar nicht, wie das wäre, wenn ein Tisch dächte.) Und hier gibt es offenbar einen graduellen Übergang zu dem Fall des Menschen.

130. Man redet nur vom ›Denken‹ unter ganz bestimmten Umständen.

131. Wie können denn der Sinn und die Wahrheit (oder die Wahrheit und der Sinn) der Sätze zugleich zusammenbrechen? (Mit einander stehen und fallen?)

132. Und ist es nicht, als wolltest du sagen: »Wenn es sich nicht so und so verhält, hat es keinen Sinn mehr zu sagen, es verhalte sich so«?

133. Also z. B.: »Wenn immer falsch gezogen worden wäre, so hätte es keinen Sinn, von einem ›falschen Zug‹ zu reden.« Aber das ist nur eine paradoxe Form, es zu sagen. Die nicht-paradoxe Form wäre: »Die allgemeine Beschreibung ..... hat keinen Sinn.«

134. Statt »man kann nicht«, sage: »es gibt in diesem Spiel nicht«. Statt »man kann im Damespiel nicht rochieren« – »es gibt im Damespiel kein Rochieren«; statt »ich kann meine Empfindung nicht vorzeigen« – »es gibt in der Verwendung des Wortes ›Empfindung‹ kein Vorzeigen dessen, was man har«; statt »man kann nicht alle Kardinalzahlen aufzählen« – »es gibt hier kein Aufzählen aller Glieder«.

135. Das Gespräch, die Anwendung und Ausdeutung der Worte fließt dahin, und nur im Fluß hat das Wort seine Bedeutung.

»Er ist abgereist.« – »Warum?« – Was meintest du, als du das Wort »warum« aussprachst? Woran dachtest du?

136. Denk ans Aufzeigen in der Schule. Muß einer sich die Antwort im Stillen vorgesagt haben, um mit Recht aufzeigen zu können? Und was muß in ihm dazu vorgegangen sein? – Nichts. Aber es ist wichtig, daß er für gewöhnlich eine Antwort wisse, wenn er aufzeigt; und das ist das Kriterium dafür, daß er das Aufzeigen versteht.

Es muß nichts in ihm vorgegangen sein; und doch wäre der merkwürdig, der in so einem Falle nie etwas über innere Vorgänge zu berichten wüßte.

137. Manchmal, wenn ich sage »Ich dachte damals .....«, kann ich berichten, daß ich mir eben diese Worte laut oder im Stillen gesagt hatte; oder wenn nicht diese, so andere Worte, wovon die gegenwärtigen eine sinngemäße Wiedergabe sind. Das kommt doch manchmal vor! Aber eben auch dies, daß meine gegenwärtigen Worte ›nicht eine Wiedergabe‹ sind. Denn ›Wiedergabe‹ sind sie nur, wenn sie es nach Regeln der Abbildung sind.

138. It seems as if a sentence containing, for example, the word "ball" already contains the shadow of other uses of this word. Namely, the possibility of forming those other sentences. - To whom does it seem so? And under what circumstances?

139. One cannot get away from the fact that the meaning of the sentence accompanies the sentence; with the sentence stands.

140. One might say, for example: "One negation does the same thing to the proposition as the other, it excludes what it describes." But these are just other words for an equation of the two negative propositions (which only applies if the negated proposition is not itself a negative proposition). The idea that what we see of the sign is only an outside of an inside in which the actual operations of sense and significance take place is always repeated.

141. Our problem might be stated (very clearly) as follows: Suppose we had two systems of measuring length: a length is expressed in both by a numeral, followed by a word which gives the measure. In one system a length is denoted by "n feet," and a foot is a unit of length in the ordinary sense; in the other system a length is denoted by "n W," and 1 foot = 1 W. But 2 W = 4 feet, 3 W = 9 feet, etc. - So the sentence "This stick is 1 W long" means the same as "This stick is 1 foot long." Question: In these two sentences, do "W" and "foot" have the same meaning?

142. The question is wrongly posed. This can be seen if we express the equality of meaning by means of an equation. The question can only be: "Is W = foot or not?" - The sentences in which these signs appear are not discussed here. - Of course, in this terminology one cannot ask whether "is" means the same here as "is" there; but one can ask whether the copula means the same as the equal sign. Well, we said: 1 foot = 1 W; but foot ≠ W.

143. One could say: in all cases what is meant by "thought" is the living element in the sentence, that without which it is dead, a mere sequence of sounds or a sequence of written figures.

But if I were to speak of something that gives meaning to a configuration of chess pieces, that is, that distinguishes it from any combination of wooden blocks, what could I not mean? The rules that make the chess configuration a situation of a game; the special experiences that we associate with such game positions; the benefit of the game.

Or if we were talking about something that distinguishes paper money from mere printed pieces of paper and gives it its meaning, its life!

144. How a word is understood cannot be determined by words alone. (Theology.)

145. There could also be a language in the use of which the impression we receive from the signs plays no role; in which there is no understanding in the sense of such an impression. The signs are transmitted to us in writing, for example, and we canthen remember them . (That is, the only impression we are talking about is the image of the sign.) If it is a command, we translate the sign into action according to rules and tables. There is no impression similar to that of an image, and we do not write stories in this language either.

146. In this case one could say: “The sign lives only in the system.”

147. It would of course also be conceivable that we would have to transfer a sentence of verbal language into a drawn picture according to rules in order to get an impression of it . (That only this picture would have a soul.)

148. It would be conceivable to have a language in which the meanings of words alternated according to certain rules, for example: In the morning word A means this, in the afternoon that.

Or a language in which words changed daily, with each day replacing each letter of the previous day with the next in the alphabet (and z with a).

149. Imagine this language: the words and grammar are those of German, but the words in the sentence are in the opposite order. A sentence in this language sounds like a German sentence that you read from the end to the beginning. The possibilities for expression are therefore just as varied as in German. But what we know as the sound of a sentence is destroyed.

150. Someone who does not know German hears me exclaim on certain occasions: "What wonderful lighting!" He guesses the meaning and then uses the exclamation himself, as I do, without, however, understanding the three words. Does he understand the exclamation?

151. I have deliberately chosen an example in which man expresses a feeling, for in this case it is said that sounds which do not belong to language are full of meaning.

152. Would it be just as easy to imagine the analogous case for this sentence: "If the train does not arrive on time at s o'clock, he will miss the connection"? What would it mean in this case: to guess the meaning?

153. It disturbs us, as it were, that the thought of a proposition is never completely present at any moment. We regard it as an object which we create and which we never fully possess, for as soon as one part comes into being, another disappears.

154. (To No. 150 ) It is easy to imagine a language in which people use a single word for that exclamation. But what about a word for the sentence "If the train ...."? In what case would we say that the word actually stands for that sentence?

For example, in this way: People initially used a sentence like ours; but then circumstances arose in which the sentence had to be uttered so often that they condensed it into one word. These people could therefore still explain the word through the sentence.

But can there also be a case in which people only have one word for that sense, that is, for that use? Why not? We must imagine how someone learns to use this word, and under what circumstances we would say that the word really represents that sentence.

But consider this: In our language, someone says "He arrives at 5 o'clock"; another answers "No, 10 minutes past 5". Does this kind of conversation also exist in the other language?

That is why meaning and significance are vague concepts.

155. The words of a poet can go right through us. And this is of course causally connected with the use they have in our lives. And it is also connected with the fact that, in accordance with this use, we let our thoughts wander here and there into the well-known surroundings of the words.

156. Is there a difference in meaning that can be explained and one that cannot be explained?

157. The soulful expression in music – it cannot be recognized according to rules. And why can we not imagine that it would be so for other beings?

158. If a topic or a phrase suddenly means something to you, you don't need to be able to explain it to yourself. This gesture is suddenlyaccessible to you.

159. You are talking about understanding music. You understand it while you are listening to it! Should we say that it is an experience that accompanies listening?

160. The speaking of music. Do not forget that a poem, even if written in the language of communication, is not used in the language-game of communication.

161. Could one not imagine that someone who has never known music, and who comes to us and hears someone playing a thoughtful Chopin, would be convinced that this is a language and that we only want to keep the meaning secret from him?

There is a strong musical element in the language of words. (A sigh, the tone of question, of announcement, of longing, all the countless gestures of tone.)

162. But when I hear a melody with understanding, isn't there something special happening in me - something that doesn't happen when I hear it without understanding? And what ? - There is no answer; or what occurs to me is absurd. I can say: "Now I have understood it" and then talk about it, play it, compare it with others, etc. Signs of understanding may accompany the listening.

163. It is wrong to call understanding a process that accompanies listening. (One could also not call the expression of it, the expressive playing, an accompaniment to listening.)

164. For how can one explain what 'expressive playing' is? Certainly not by something that accompanies the playing. – So what does it involve? A culture, one might say. – Anyone who has been brought up in a certain culture – and then reacts to music in a certain way – can be taught to use the term 'expressive playing'.

165. Understanding music is neither a sensation nor a sum of sensations. To call it an experience is nevertheless correct insofar as this concept of understanding has many similarities with other concepts of experience. One says, "I experienced this passage quite differently this time." But this expression only describes " what happened " for someone who is at home in a special conceptual world belonging to these situations. (Analogy: "I won the game.")

166. This is what I have in mind when I read. So something is happening when I read...? – This question doesn't lead anywhere.

167. How can I imagine this? – Not in the dimensions you have in mind.

168. How do I know that someone is delighted? How do you learn the verbal expression of delight? What is it linked to? The expression of bodily sensations? Do we ask someone what he feels in his chest, in his facial muscles, to find out whether he is experiencing pleasure?

169. But does this mean that there are not feelings that often recur when enjoying music? Not at all.

170. A poem makes an impression on us when we read it. "Do you feel the same while you are reading it as when you read something indifferent?" - How have I learned to answer this question? I will perhaps say: "Of course not!" - which means: I am moved by this and not by the other.

"I experience something different." - And what kind of experience is this? - I cannot give a satisfactory answer. For what I am stating is not the most important thing. - "But did you not enjoy it while reading?" Of course - for the opposite answer would mean: I would have enjoyed it sooner or later, and I do not want to say that.

But now you do remember the feelings and ideas that came with reading, those that are connected with enjoyment and impressions. But they only gained their significance through their surroundings: through reading the poem, through my familiarity with the language, the meter and countless connections.

You must ask yourself how we learned the expression "Isn't that wonderful!" in the first place? No one explained it to us by referring to the sensations, ideas or thoughts that accompany listening! Yes, we would not doubt that he enjoyed it if he could not describe any such experiences; but we would doubt if it turned out that he did not understand certain connections.

171. But does understanding not show itself, for example, in the expression with which someone reads the poem or sings the melody? Certainly. But what is the experience here during reading? One would have to say: he who hears it read well or feels it in his speech organs enjoys and understands it.

172. One can also say that understanding a musical phrase is like understanding a language .

173. I am thinking of a very short one of only two bars. You say, "What isn't there in it!" But it is only an optical illusion, so to speak, if you think that what is in it takes precedence when you hear it. ("It depends on who says it.") (Words only have meaning in the flow of thoughts and life.)

174. This is notthe deception contains: " Now I understand" - and now perhaps follows a long explanation of what I have understood.

175. Does the topic point to nothing outside itself? Oh yes! But that means: – The impression it makes on me is connected with things in its environment – ​​for example, with our language and its intonation, that is, with the whole field of our language games.

If, for example, I say: It is as if a conclusion were drawn here, or as if something were affirmed here, or as if this were an answer to what came before, my understanding presupposes familiarity with conclusions, affirmations, answers.

176. Die Worte »Gottlob! Noch etwas Weniges hat man geflüchtet – vor den Fingern der Kroaten«, mit ihrem Ton und Blick, scheinen allerdings schon jede Nuance ihrer Bedeutung in sich zu tragen. Nur darum aber, weil wir sie als Teil einer bestimmten Szene kennen. Man könnte aber eine ganz andere Szene um diese Worte (im gleichen Tone gesprochen) bauen um zu zeigen, wie ihre besondere Seele in der Geschichte liegt, zu der sie gehören.

177. Wenn ich einen mit verbannender Gebärde sagen höre »Weiche!«, erlebe ich hier die Bedeutung des Wortes, wie in dem Spiel, wenn ich mir's für mich vorsage und es einmal so und einmal so ›meine‹? – Denn er konnte ja auch sagen »Weiche von mir«, und dann erlebte ich vielleicht die ganze Phrase so und so; aber auch das einzelne Wort? Die ergänzenden Worte waren es vielleicht, die mir den Eindruck machten.

178. Das besondere Erlebnis der Bedeutung ist charakterisiert dadurch, daß wir mit einer Erklärung und der Vergangenheitsform reagieren: gerade so, als erklärten wir die Bedeutung eines Worts für praktische Zwecke.

179. Vergiß, vergiß, daß du diese Erlebnisse selber hast!

180. Wie konnte er das Wort in der Bedeutung hören? Wie war es möglich?! Gar nicht –– in diesen Dimensionen. ––

181. Aber ist es also nicht wahr, daß das Wort für mich jetzt das bedeutet? Warum nicht? Es kommt ja dieser Sinn mit der übrigen Verwendung des Wortes nicht in Konflikt.

Es sagt einer: »Gib ihm die Nachricht .... und meine damit ....!« –– Was wäre der Sinn dieses Befehls?

182. »Als ich das Wort jetzt aussprach, bedeutete es für mich....«. Warum sollte das nicht einfach Wahnsinn sein? Weil ich das erlebte? Das ist kein Grund.

183. Der, den ich bedeutungsblind nenne, wird wohl den Auftrag verstehen: »Sag ihm, er solle zur Bank gehen, – ich meine die Gartenbank«, aber nicht: »Sag das Wort Bank und meine damit Gartenbank«. Welche Formen geistiger Defekte bei Menschen vorgefunden werden, kümmert diese Untersuchung nicht; wohl aber die Möglichkeit solcher Formen. Nicht, ob es Menschen gibt, die eines Gedankens vom Typus »Ich wollte damals ....« nicht fähig sind, – sondern wie der Begriff so eines Defekts durchzuführen wäre, interessiert uns.

Wenn du annimmst, daß einer das nicht kann, wie ist es dann mit dem? Soll er es auch nicht können? – Wohin führt uns dieser Begriff? Denn wir haben ja hier Paradigmen.

184. Different people feel it to very different degrees when the spelling of a word is changed. And the feeling is not just one of respect for an old usage. – Anyone for whom orthography is only a practical question lacks a feeling not unlike that which a person "blind to meaning" would lack. (Goethe on personal names. The prisoner's number.)

185. Just as some people do not understand the question "What color does the vowel a have for you ?" – If someone did not understand it, if he declared it to be nonsense, – could we say that he does not understand German, or does not understand the meanings of the words "color", "vowel", etc.?

On the contrary: If he has learned to understand these words, then he can also respond to those questions ›with understanding‹ or ›without understanding‹.

186. Misunderstanding – lack of understanding. Understanding is brought about by explanation; but also by training.

187. Why can't you teach a cat to fetch? Does it not understand what you want? And what is the difference between understanding and lack of understanding here?

188. "I read every word with the feeling that corresponds to it. The word, for example, with the but-feeling - etc." - And even if that is true, what does it actually mean? What is the logic of the concept 'but-feeling'? - It does not become a feeling just because I call it 'feeling'.

189. Is lying a specific experience? Well, can I tell someone, "I'm going to lie to you now," and then do it?

190. To what extent am I conscious of the lie while I am lying? Only insofar as I do not become conscious of it later, and yet I know later that I have lied. Being conscious of the lie is an ability . This is not contradicted by the fact that there are characteristic feelings of lying. [ Marginal note: intention.]

191. Knowledge is not translated into words when it is expressed. Words are not a translation of something else that came before them,

192. “To resolve to do something is a special inner process.” – But what kind of process – even if you were allowed to invent it – could achieve what we demand of a resolution?

193. Isn't it exactly the same with the verb "to understand"? Someone explains to me the route I have to take here and there. He asks, "Did you understand me?" I answer, "I understood." - Do I want to tell him what was going on in my mind during his explanation? - And yet I love to tell him that too.

194. ‌ Imagine‌ this‌ game:‌ A‌ list‌ of‌ words‌ from‌ different‌ languages‌ and‌ of‌ meaningless‌ sequences‌ of‌ sounds‌ is‌ read‌ out‌ to‌ me.‌ After‌ each‌ one,‌ I‌ have‌ to‌ say‌ whether‌ I‌ understand‌ it‌ or‌ not;‌ also‌ what‌ was‌ going‌ on‌ inside‌ me‌ when‌ I‌ understood‌ it‌ or‌ didn't‌ understand it. – I will answer the word “tree” without thinking about it with “yes” (an image may come to mind); I will answer a combination of sounds that I have never heard before with “no” just as unhesitatingly. With words that designate a specific shade of color, the answer will often be preceded by an image; with rare words (“continuum”) for example) a consideration; for words such as the article "das", a shrug of the shoulders; I will sometimes translate words from a foreign language into German; images come to mind, sometimes they are those of the objects that are designated by the words (again, thousands of different cases), sometimes other images.

This game could be supplemented by one in which someone names activities and asks for each one: "Can you do that?" The subject should state what reasons he or she had for answering the question with "yes" or "no."

195. Let us imagine a kind of picture puzzle in which there is no specific object to be found, but which at first glance appears to us as a jumble of meaningless lines and only after some searching as, let us say, a landscape. – What is the difference between looking at the picture before and after the solution? It is clear that we see it differently both times. But to what extent can we say after the solution that the picture now tells us something, whereas before it didn't tell us anything?

196. We can also pose this question like this: What is the general characteristic that the solution has been found?

197. ‌ I will assume that,‌ as soon as it is solved,‌ I make the solution recognizable by strongly tracing certain lines of the picture and perhaps adding shadows.‌ Why do you now call the picture that you have drawn a solution?

‌(a)‌ Because‌ it‌ is‌ the‌ clear‌ representation‌ of‌ a‌ group‌ of‌ spatial‌ objects.‌

(b)‌ Because‌ it‌ is‌ the‌ representation‌ of‌ a‌ regular‌ body.‌

(c)‌ Because‌ it‌ is‌ a‌ symmetrical‌ figure.‌

(d) Because it is a figure that gives me an ornamental impression.

(e) Because it is a representation of a body that seems familiar to me.

(f) Because there is a list of resolutions and this figure (this body) is on the list.

(g) Because it represents a kind of object which I know well: for it gives me the immediate impression of familiarity, I immediately connect with it all sorts of associations; I know what it is called; I know that I have often seen it; I know what it is used for; etc.

(h) Because I seem to know the object well: a word immediately occurs to me as its name (although the word does not belong to any existing language); I say to myself "Of course, that is a ..." and give myself a nonsensical explanation that seems to make sense to me at that moment. (As in a dream.)

(i) Because it depicts a face that looks familiar to me.

(j) Because it represents a face which I recognise: it is the face of my friend N; it is a face which I have often seen depicted. Etc.

(k) Because it represents an object that I remember having seen once.

(l) Because it is an ornament that I know well (although I do not know where I saw it).

(m) Because it is an ornament that I know well: I know its name, I know where I have seen it before.

(n) Because it is a furnishing in my room.

(o) Because I instinctively traced these lines and now I feel calm.

(p) Because I remember that this object has been described.

(Anyone who does not understand why we talk about these things must find what we say to be an empty game.)

198. Can I think away the impression of acquaintance where it is, and think in where it is not? And what does that mean? For example, I look at the face of a friend and ask myself: What does this face look like when I see it as a face that is unfamiliar to me (as if I were seeing it for the first time)? What remains, so to speak, of the sight of the face when I think away the impression of acquaintance, subtract it? Here I am inclined to say: "It is very difficult to separate acquaintance from the impression of the face." But I also feel that this is a bad way of expressing it. I do not know how I can even try to separate the two. The expression "separate them" has no clear meaning for me.

I know what it means : "Imagine this table black instead of brown." The equivalent is: "Paint this table, but black instead of brown."

199. What if one said: »Imagine this butterfly exactly as it is, but ugly instead of beautiful«?!

200. We have not defined in this casewhat it means to think away the notoriety.

It might mean, for example, remembering the impression I had when I first saw the face.

201. A drawing of the interior of a radio receiver will be a jumble of meaningless lines for someone who has no knowledge of such things. But if he has become acquainted with the apparatus and its function, the drawing will be a meaningful picture for him.

Given any physical shape that is meaningless to me at the moment (perhaps in a picture), can I imagine it as meaningful at will? That would be like asking: Can I imagine an object of any shape as an object of use? But for what use?

One could methodically imagine one class of body shapes as the dwellings of animals or people. Another class as weapons. One as models of landscapes. Etc. etc. And here I know how to ascribe meaning to a meaningless form.

202. Think carefully about how we use the word "recognize"! I recognize the furniture in my room, my friend, whom I see every day. But no "recognition" takes place.

203. One could say: I would have no impression of the room as a whole if I could not let my gaze wander quickly here and there and move around freely in it. (Stream of thought.) But now the question is, how does it manifest itself that I 'have an impression of it as a whole'? For example, in the naturalness with which I find my way around in it; in the absence of searching, doubt and surprise. In the fact that a multitude of activities are limited by its walls and that I summarize all of this in speech as 'my room'. In the fact that I find it useful and necessary to repeatedly use the term 'my room' in contrast to its walls, corners, etc.

204. What does the description of an ›attitude‹ look like?

For example, one says: "Ignore these spots and this small irregularity and look at it as a picture of a ...!"

"Imagine it away! Would it be unpleasant for you even without this ...?" People will say that I change my facial image - as if I were blinking or ignoring a detail. This "ignoring ..." plays a very similar role to, for example, the creation of a new image.

205. Well, and these are good reasons for saying that we have changed our visual impression through our attitude. That is, these are good reasons for limiting the concept of 'visual impression' in this way.

206. "But I can obviously put elements together in my vision (lines, for example)!" But why do we call it "putting together"? Why do we need a word here - essentially - which already has a different meaning? (It is of course the same as in the case of the word "do mental arithmetic ".)

207. If I say to someone: "Put these lines (or other things) together!" what will he do? Well, various things, depending on the circumstances. Perhaps he should count them two by two, or put them in a drawer, or look at them, etc.

208. Let us consider what one says about a phenomenon like this:

See the figure note 208.pngonce as an F, once as the mirror image of an F.

I want to ask: What does it consist of seeing the figure one way and another? – Do I really see something different each time? Or do I just interpret what I see in different ways? – I am inclined to say the first. But why? Well, interpreting is an action. It can consist, for example, in someone saying "That should be an F"; or in not saying it, but replacing the sign with an F when copying; or in thinking: "What could that be? It must be an F that the writer has failed to write." – Seeing is not an action, but a state. (Grammatical remark.) And if I have never read the figure other than F, never considered what it might be, then people will say that I see it as F; if they know that it can also be seen differently. I would call it "interpreting" if I said: "That should certainly be an F; the writer writes all his Fs like this."

How did we come up with the concept of 'this as that'? On what occasions is it formed, is there a need for it? (Very common in art.) For example, where it is a question of phrasing through the eye or ear. We say 'You must hear these bars as an introduction', 'You must listen in this key', 'Once you have seen this figure as ...., it is difficult to see it any other way', 'I hear the French 'ne .... pas' as a two-part negation, but not as 'not a step'', etc. etc. Is it really seeing or hearing? Well, that is what we call it; we react with these words in certain situations. And we react to these words with certain actions.

209. This form that I see - I would like to say - is not simply a form, but it is one of the forms that I know; it is a form that is distinguished in advance. It is one of the forms whose image was already in me, and only because it corresponds to such an image is it the well-known form. (I carry around with me, as it were, a catalogue of such forms, and the objects that are depicted there are then the well-known ones.)

210. But the fact that I have carried the image around with me before would only be a causal explanation of the present impression. It is as if one were to say: this movement is so easy, as if it had been practiced.

211. "If I am asked 'Do you see a sphere there?', another time 'Do you see the hemisphere there?', what I see may be the same in both cases, and if I answer 'yes', I am still distinguishing between the two hypotheses. Just as in a game of chess I distinguish between a pawn and a king, even if the current move is one that both could make, and even if a king's piece functions as a pawn." - In philosophy one is always in danger of creating a myth of symbolism, or one of mental processes, instead of simply saying what everyone knows and must admit.

212. Is it introspection that tells me whether I am dealing with a genuine seeing or with an interpretation? First of all, I must be clear about what I would call an interpretation; how can I tell whether something is to be called an interpretation or a seeing. [ Marginal note: Seeing according to an interpretation.]

213. Do I not see the character sometimes one way, sometimes another, even if I do not react with words or in any other way?

But "sometimes like this," "sometimes different" are words, and what right do I have to use them here? Can I prove my right to you or to myself? (Unless through a further reaction.)

But I know that there are two impressions, even if I don't say it! But how do I know that what I then say is what I knew? What consequences follow from my interpreting this as that? What consequences from my seeing this as that?

214. Experience of real size. We see a picture that shows the shape of a chair; we are told that it represents a construction the size of a house. Now we see it differently.

215. Imagine that someone who is looking at the sun suddenly has the sensation that it is not the sun that is moving, but that we are passing in front of it. Now he wants to say that he has seen a new state of motion in which we find ourselves; and imagine that he now shows by gestures which movement he means and that it is not that of the sun. We would have to deal here with two different uses of the word "motion."

216. What one sees is not the change of aspect, but the change of interpretation.

217. You see it not by interpretation, but by interpretation.

218. I interpret words, but do I also interpret facial expressions? Do I interpret a facial expression as threatening or friendly? It can happen.

If I now said: "It is not enough that I perceive the threatening face, I must first interpret it." - Someone pulls a knife on me and I say: "I take that as a threat."

219. We understand Chinese signs as little as we understand Chinese sentences.

220. Consciousness in the other person's face. Look into the other person's face and see the consciousness in it and a certain tone of consciousness . You see on it, in it, joy, indifference, interest, emotion, dullness, etc. The light in the other person's face.

Do you look within yourself to see the wrath in his face? It is as evident there as in your own breast.

(And what can one say now? That the other person's face inspires me to imitate it, and that I therefore feel small movements and muscle tensions in my own and think of the sum of these ? Nonsense. Nonsense, because you are making assumptions instead of just describing. Anyone who has explanations floating around in their head here is neglecting to remember the most important facts.)

221. "Consciousness is as clear in his face and demeanor as in myself."

222. We do not see the human eye as a receiver; it does not seem to let anything in, but to send it out. The ear receives; the eye looks. (It casts glances, it flashes, shines, glows.) One can frighten with the eye, not with the ear or the nose. When you see the eye, you see something coming from it. You see the look of the eye.

223. "If you just get away from your physiological prejudices, you will find nothing wrong with the fact that the look of the eye can also be seen." I also say that I see the look that you give the other person. And if someone wanted to correct me and say that I don't actually see it, I would think that was sheer stupidity.

On the other hand, I have not admitted anything by my way of speaking , and I contradict the person who tells me that I see the look 'just like' the shape and color of the eye.

Because ›naive speaking‹, that is, our naive, normal way of expressing ourselves, does not contain any theory of seeing – it does not show you any theory , but only a concept of seeing.

224. Let a person look angry, haughty, ironic; and now cover his face so that only the eyes remain free, in which the whole expression seemed to be united: their expression is now surprisingly ambiguous .

225. "One sees emotion." - In contrast to what? One does not see the facial expressions and then concludes (like the doctor who makes a diagnosis) that the face is joy, sadness, boredom. One immediately describes one's face as sad, radiant with happiness, bored, even if one is unable to give any other description of the facial features. - One might say that sadness is personified in the face.

This belongs to the concept of emotion.

226. (The ugliness of a person can be repulsive in a picture, in a painting, as in reality, but also in description, in words.)

227. It is strange: we would like to explain our understanding of a gesture by translating it into words, and the understanding of words by translating it into a gesture. (So we are thrown back and forth when we try to find out where the understanding actually lies.)

And indeed we shall explain words by a gesture, and a gesture by words.

228. Explain to someone that the position of the hands that you have drawn is meant to express: the hands of this clock are now in this position. – The awkwardness with which the sign, like a mute, tries to make itself understood by all kinds of suggestive gestures – it disappears when we realize that it depends on the system to which the sign belongs.

One wanted to say: only the thought can say it , not the sign.

229. An interpretation is something that is given in signs. It is this interpretation in contrast to another (which is different). – If one wanted to say, “Every sentence requires an interpretation,” that would mean: no sentence can be understood without an addition.

230. It would be almost similar if, when rolling dice, one determined how much a throw should count for by another throw.

231. By "intention" I mean here what the sign is used for in thought. The intention seems to interpret, to give the final interpretation; not another sign or image, but something else, that which cannot be interpreted again. But a psychological end is reached, not a logical one.

Let us imagine a sign language, an 'abstract' one, I mean one that is foreign to us, in which we do not feel at home, in which, as we would say, we do not think ; and let us imagine this language interpreted by a translation into what we would like to call an unambiguous pictorial language; a language consisting of pictures painted in perspective. It is quite clear that it is much easier to imagine different interpretations of written characters than of a picture painted in the usual way. Here we will also be inclined to think that there is no longer any possibility of interpretation.

232. We could also say that we do not live in sign language, but in the painted image.

233. »Nur das intendierte Bild reicht als Maßstab an die Wirklichkeit heran. Von außen betrachtet, steht es gleich tot und isoliert da.« – Es ist, als hätten wir ein Bild erst so angeschaut, daß wir in ihm leben und die Gegenstände in ihm uns als wirkliche umgeben, und dann traten wir zurück und wären nun außerhalb, sähen den Rahmen, und das Bild wäre eine bemalte Fläche. So, wenn wir intendieren, umgeben uns die Bilder der Intention, und wir leben unter ihnen. Aber wenn wir aus der Intention heraustreten, so sind es bloße Flecke auf einer Leinwand, ohne Leben und ohne Interesse für uns. Wenn wir intendieren, leben wir im Raum der Intention, unter den Bildern (Schatten) der Intention zugleich mit den wirklichen Dingen. Denken wir, wir sitzen im verdunkelten Kino und leben im Film. Der Saal wird nun erhellt, aber das Lichtspiel auf der Leinwand geht weiter. Aber jetzt stehen wir plötzlich außerhalb und sehen es als Bewegungen von lichten und dunkeln Flecken auf einer Leinwand.

(Im Traum geschieht es manchmal, daß wir eine Geschichte erst lesen und dann in ihr selbst agieren. Und nach dem Aufwachen aus einem Traum ist es manchmal, als wären wir aus dem Traum heraus zurückgetreten und sehen ihn jetzt als ein fremdes Bild vor uns.) Und es heißt auch etwas, »in den Seiten eines Buches leben«.

234. Nicht das findet statt, daß sich dieses Symbol nicht mehr deuten läßt, sondern: ich deute nicht. Ich deute nicht, weil ich mich in dem gegenwärtigen Bild heimisch fühle. Wenn ich deute, so schreite ich auf dem Gedankenweg von Stufe zu Stufe.

235. Sehe ich das gedachte Symbol ›von außen‹ an, so kommt es mir zum Bewußtsein, daß es so und so gedeutet werden könnte; ist es eine Stufe meines Gedankenweges, so ist es ein mir natürlicher Aufenthalt, und es beschäftigt (und beunruhigt) mich seine weitere Deutbarkeit nicht. – Wie ich die Tabelle, den Fahrplan bei mir habe und verwende, ohne daß es mich beschäftigt, daß eine Tabelle verschiedenerlei Deutungen zuläßt.

236. Wenn ich den Vorgang der Intention beschreiben will, so fühle ich vor allem, daß sie noch am ehesten leisten kann, was sie soll, wenn sie ein äußerst getreues Bild von dem enthält, was sie intendiert. Aber ferner, daß auch das nicht ausreicht, weil ja das Bild, was immer es ist, sich verschieden deuten läßt; daß also dieses Bild doch wieder isoliert dasteht. Wie man das Bild allein ins Auge faßt, ist es plötzlich tot, und es ist, als wäre ihm etwas genommen worden, was es zuvor belebt hatte. Es ist kein Gedanke, keine Intention, und wie immer wir es uns begleitet denken, durch artikulierte oder unartikulierte Vorgänge, und durch welche Empfindungen immer: es bleibt isoliert, weist nicht aus sich heraus auf eine Realität außer ihm.

Now one says: "Of course the image does not intend, but we must intend something with it." But if this intending, meaning, is something that happens with the image, then I do not see why it should be tied to a human being. One can also study the process of digestion as a chemical process, regardless of whether it takes place in a living being. We want to say: "Meaning is essentially a mental process, a process of conscious life, not of dead matter." But what should make such a process other than the specific nature of what is happening - as long as we are thinking of a process. And now it seems to us as if no process, of whatever kind, can be intending. - Here we are not satisfied with the grammar of the process , and not with the specific nature of a process. - One could say: we would call every process "dead" in this sense!

237. One could almost say: "Opinion goes while every process stands still."

238. People say: How can this gesture, this position of the hand, this image be the wish that such and such were the case? It is nothing more than a hand over a table, standing there alone and without meaning ! Like a single set that has been left standing alone in a room after a play. It only had life in the play.

239. "The thought stood before my mind at that moment." - And how? - "I had this image." - So the image was the thought? No; for if I had merely communicated the image to someone, he would not have received the thought.

240. The picture was the key. Or at least it appeared as a key.

241. Let us imagine a picture story in schematic images, that is, more similar to a story in a language, as a series of realistic images. One could, for example, have captured the course of battles in such a picture language. (Language game.) And a sentence in our verbal language is much closer to an image of this picture language than one might think.

242. Let us also remember that we do not first translate such images into realistic ones in order to 'understand' them, just as we never translate photographs or the images of a film into coloured images, although black and white people or plants would seem indescribably strange and terrible to us in reality.

What if we now said here »A picture is something only in a pictorial language«?

243. Of course, I read a story and don't give a damn about a system of language. I simply read, have impressions, see pictures in front of me, etc. I let the story pass before me like pictures, like a picture story. (Of course, I don't mean to say that every sentence evokes a visual image or several in me, and that that is the purpose of a sentence.)

244. “Sentences serve to describe how everything behaves,” we think. The sentence as an image .

245. I understand this picture exactly, I could model it in clay. – I understand this description exactly, I could make a drawing from it.

In many cases, one could set the criterion for understanding as being that one must be able to represent the meaning of the sentence in a graphic form. (I am thinking of an officially established test of understanding.) How are people tested in map reading, for example?

246. And the meaningful picture is that which I can not only draw, but also represent plastically. And it would make sense to say this. But thinking the sentence is not an activity which one carries out according to the words (like singing according to the notes). The following example shows this. Does it make sense to say "I have as many friends as a solution to the equation ....."? Whether this makes sense cannot be seen directly from the equation. And one does not know, while reading the sentence, whether it can be thought or not. Whether it can be understood or not.

247. What does it mean to “discover that a sentence has no meaning”?

And what does it mean: “If I mean something by it, it must have meaning”:

The first thing is not to be misled by the appearance of a sentence and to examine its application in the language game.

And "if I mean something by it" - does that mean something similar to: "if I can imagine something by it"? - From the imagination there is often a path to further use.

248. (Something that at first glance looks like a sentence and is not one.) The following proposal for the design of a road roller was once communicated to me. The engine is located inside the hollow roller. The crankshaft runs through the center of the roller and is connected to the roller rim at both ends by spokes. The cylinder of the engine is attached to the inside of the roller. At first glance this design looks like a machine. But it is a rigid system and the piston cannot move in and out of the cylinder. We have deprived it of the possibility of movement and we do not know it.

249. »Nothing is easier than imagining a 4-dimensional cube! It looks like this: [1]

note 249.gif
«.

But that’s not what I mean, I mean something like

note 249.png
only with 4 extensions! – »But isn’t what I have shown you something like

note 249.png
only with 4 dimensions?' - No, that 's not what I mean ! - But what do I mean? What is my picture? Well, it's not the 4-dimensional cube as you drew it ! All I have as a picture now are the words and the rejection of everything you can show me.

250. Are roses red in the dark? – One can think of the rose in the dark as red. –

(The fact that one can 'think' something does not mean that it makes sense to say it.)

251. "The assumption that this person - who behaves completely normally - is nevertheless blind does make sense!" - That is, 'it is an assumption', 'I can really assume something like that'. And that means: I do form an image of what I assume. Yes, but does it go any further? If I make the assumption that someone is blind under different circumstances, I never confirm to myself that this assumption really makes sense. And the fact that I am actually thinking something, that I have an image, then plays no role at all. This image only becomes important here, where it is, so to speak, the only evidence that I have really made an assumption. In fact, it is all that is left of the assumption here.

252. "I can very well imagine that someone would act in this way and yet see nothing shameful in the action." - And now follows a description of how one should imagine this.

"I can imagine a human society in which it is considered indecent to do arithmetic, except for entertainment." This means something like: I could easily paint this picture further.

253. "I have actually never seen a black spot gradually become lighter until it is white, then the white become redder and redder until it is red. But I know it is possible because I can imagine it."

254. (When you talk to someone about a division of time, it often happens that you pull out your watch, not to see what time it is, but to get a picture of the division that has been considered.)

255. How can one learn the truth by thinking? How one learns to see a face better by drawing it.

256. Philosophers who believe that experience can be extended through thought should remember that speech can be transmitted by telephone, but not measles.

I also cannot perceive time as limited if I want to, or the field of vision as homogeneous, etc.

257. Would it be possible to discover a new color? (For the color-blind person is in the same situation as we are; his colors form a system just as complete as ours; he sees no gap where the other colors would fit in.)

(Compare with mathematics.)

258. Man kann in der Logik die Allgemeinheit nicht weiter ausdehnen, als unsere logische Voraussicht reicht. Oder richtiger: als unser logischer Blick reicht.

259. »Wie aber kann der menschliche Verstand der Wirklichkeit vorausfliegen, und selbst das Unverifizierbare denken?« – Warum sollen wir nicht das Unverifizierbare reden? Wir machten es ja selbst unverifizierbar.

Es wird ein falscher Schein erzeugt? Und wie kann es auch nur So scheinen? Willst du denn nicht sagen, daß dies so auch nicht einmal eine Beschreibung ist? Nun, dann ist es also kein falscher Schein, sondern vielmehr einer, der uns der Orientierung beraubt. So daß wir uns an den Kopf greifen und eben fragen: Wie ist es möglich?

260. Man kann nur scheinbar »über jede mögliche Erfahrung hinausgehen«; ja, dieses Wort hat auch nur scheinbar Sinn, weil es nach Analogie sinnvoller Ausdrücke gebildet ist.

261. Die »Philosophie des Als Ob« beruht ganz auf dieser Verwechslung zwischen Gleichnis und Wirklichkeit.

262. »Ich kann doch nicht in den Gedanken, durch Worte, eine Voraussicht erschleichen von etwas, was ich nicht kenne.

(Nihil est in intellectu .....)

Als könnte ich in den Gedanken gleichsam von hinten herum kommen und einen Blick von etwas erhaschen, was von vorn zu sehen unmöglich ist.«

263. Daher ist auch etwas daran richtig, daß die Unvorstellbarkeit ein Kriterium der Unsinnigkeit ist.

264. Wie, wenn einer sagte: »Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, wie das ist, wenn man einen Sessel sieht, außer wenn ich ihn gerade sehe«? Wäre er berechtigt, das zu sagen?

265. Bin ich berechtigt zu sagen, »Ich kann |||||||||| nicht als Gestalt sehen«? Was berechtigt mich dazu? (Was berechtigt den Blinden zu sagen, er könne nicht sehen?)

266. Kannst du dir absolutes Gehör vorstellen, wenn du es nicht hast? – Kannst du es dir vorstellen, wenn du es hast? – Kann ein Blinder sich das Sehen vorstellen? Kann ich mir es vorstellen? – Kann ich mir vorstellen, daß ich so und so spontan reagiere, wenn ich's nicht tue? – Kann ich mir's besser vorstellen, wenn ich's tue? ((Gehört zu der Frage: Kann ich mir vorstellen, daß jemand |||||||||| als artikulierte Gestalt sieht.))

267. Soll es Erfahrungstatsache sein, daß, wer ein Erlebnis hatte, es sich vorstellen kann, und daß es ein Andrer nicht kann? (Wie weiß ich, daß der Blinde sich die Farben vorstellen kann?) Aber: er kann ein Sprachspiel nicht spielen (nicht erlernen). Aber wie? Erfahrungsgemäß oder eo ipso? Das letztere.

268. Was würden wir dem sagen, der behauptete, er könne sich genau vorstellen, wie es ist, absolutes Gehör zu haben, ohne daß er's hat?

269. Wenn man glaubt, sich einen vierdimensionalen Raum vorstellen zu können, warum nicht auch vierdimensionale Farben, das sind Farben, die außer dem Grad der Sättigung, dem Farbton und der Lichtstärke noch eine vierte Bestimmung zulassen?

270. »Wie kann es denn Sinn haben, von einer mir ganz neuen Art der Sinneswahrnehmung zu reden, die ich vielleicht einmal haben werde? Wenn du nämlich nicht etwa vom Sinnesorgan reden willst.«

271. Wozu dient ein Satz wie dieser: »Wir können uns die Empfindungen eines Jongleurs wie Rastelli gar nicht vorstellen«?

272. »Es hat Sinn, von einer endlosen Baumreihe zu reden; ich kann mir doch vorstellen, daß eine Baumreihe ohne Ende weiterläuft.« D. h. etwa: Wenn es Sinn hat zu sagen, die Baumreihe komme hier zu einem Ende, hat es Sinn zu sagen, [sie komme nie zu einem Ende].[2] Ramsey pflegte auf solche Fragen zu antworten: es sei eben doch möglich, so etwas zu denken. So etwa, wie man sagt »Die Technik leistet heute eben Dinge, die du dir gar nie vorstellen kannst.« –– Nun, da muß man herausfinden, was du dabei denkst. (Daß du versicherst, diese Phrase ließe sich denken – was kann ich damit machen? Darauf kommt es ja nicht an. Ihr Zweck ist ja nicht der, Nebel in deiner Seele aufsteigen zu lassen.) Was du meinst – Wie ist es herauszufinden? Wir müssen geduldig prüfen, wie dieser Satz angewandt werden soll. Wie rund um ihn alles aussieht. Da wird sich sein Sinn zeigen.

273. Hardy: »That ›the finite cannot understand the infinite‹ should surely be a theological and not a mathematical war-cry.« Es ist wahr, dieser Ausdruck ist ungeschickt. Aber was Leute damit sagen wollen, ist: »Es muß hier doch mit rechten Dingen zugehen! Woher dieser Sprung von Endlichen zum Unendlichen?« Und so ganz unsinnig ist die Ausdrucksweise auch nicht – nur ist das ›Endliche‹, was das Unendliche nicht soll denken können, nicht ›der Mensch‹, oder ›unser Verstand‹, sondern der Kalkül. Und wie dieser das ›Unendliche‹ denkt, dies ist wohl einer Untersuchung wert. Und die ist zu vergleichen der genauen Untersuchung und Klärung der Geschäftsgebarung eines Unternehmens durch einen Chartered Accountant. Das Ziel ist eine übersichtliche, vergleichende Darstellung aller Anwendungen, Illustrationen, Auffassungen des Kalküls. Die vollkommene Übersicht über alles, was Unklarheit schaffen kann. Und diese Übersicht muß sich auf ein weites Gebiet erstrecken, denn die Wurzeln unserer Ideen reichen weit. – »Das Endliche kann nicht das Unendliche verstehen«, heißt hier: So kann es nicht zugehen, wie ihr es in charakteristischer Oberflächlichkeit darstellt.

Der Gedanke kann gleichsam fliegen, er braucht nicht zu gehen. Du verstehst, d. h. übersiehst deine Transaktionen nicht und projizierst quasi dein Unverständnis in die Idee eines Mediums, in dem das Erstaunlichste möglich ist.

274. Das ›wirklich Unendliche‹ ist ein ›bloßes Wort‹. Besser wäre zu sagen: dieser Ausdruck schafft vorläufig bloß ein Bild, – das noch in der Luft hängt; dessen Anwendung du uns noch schuldig bist.

275. Eine unendlich lange Kugelreihe, ein unendlich langer Stab. Denk dir, davon sei in einer Art Märchen die Rede. Welche Anwendung könnte man, wenn auch nur fiktiv, von diesem Begriff machen? Die Frage sei jetzt nicht: Kann es so etwas geben? Sondern: Was stellen wir uns vor? Lass also deiner Einbildung wirklich die Zügel schießen! Du kannst es jetzt haben, wie du's willst. Du brauchst nur zu sagen, wie du's willst. Mach also (nur) ein Wortbild; illustrier es, wie du willst – durch Zeichnungen, durch Vergleiche etc.! Du kannst also – gleichsam – eine Werkzeichnung anfertigen. – Und nun ist noch die Frage, wie nach ihr gearbeitet werden soll.

276. Ich glaube, im Reihenstück ganz fein eine Zeichnung zu erblicken, die nurmehr des »u.s.w.« bedarf, um in die Unendlichkeit zu reichen.

»Ich erblicke ein Charakteristikum in ihr.« – Nun, doch etwas, was dem algebraischen Ausdruck entspricht. – »Ja, aber nichts Geschriebenes, sondern förmlich etwas Ätherisches.« – Welches seltsame Bild. – »Etwas, was nicht der algebraische Ausdruck ist, sondern wofür dieser nur eben der Ausdruck ist.«

277. I see something in it - similar to a figure in a picture puzzle. And when I see that, I say "That's all I need." - Whoever finds the signpost is not looking for further instructions, but he goes . (And if I said "he now follows it" instead of "he goes," the difference between the two could only be that the second expression alludes to certain psychological concomitant phenomena.)

278. What does it mean that a straight line can be extended as desired? Isn't there an "And so on ad inf." here, which is quite different from that of mathematical induction? According to what has been said so far, the expression would be for the possibility of extension, in the sense of describing the extended piece or the extension. At first glance, it doesn't seem to be a question of numbers at all here. I can imagine that the pencil that draws the line continues its movement and goes on like this forever. But is it also conceivable that there is no possibility of accompanying this process with a countable process? I don't think so.

279. When do we say: "The line tells me this as a rule - always the same"? And on the other hand: "It tells me again and again what I have to do - it is not a rule"?

In the first case it means: I have no further authority to tell me what I have to do. The rule does it all by itself; I only need to follow it (and following is just one thing ). I do not feel, for example: it is strange that the line always tells me something. – The other sentence says: I do not know what I am going to do; the line will tell me.

280. One could imagine that someone with such feelings would multiply, really multiply, saying over and over again, "I don't know - now the rule suddenly tells me this !" - and that we would answer, "Of course; you are proceeding entirely according to the rule."

281. To say that the points obtained by this experiment lie on average on this line, for example a straight line, is to say something like: "Seen from this distance, they appear to lie on a straight line."

I can say of a stretch of road that the general impression is that of a straight line; but not of the line note 281.png; although it would be possible to see it as a part of a longer line in which the deviation from the straight line would be lost. I cannot say: "This part of the line looks straight, for it may be a part of a line which, as a whole, gives me the impression of a straight line." (Mountains on the earth and on the moon. Earth a sphere.)

282. "She irresponsibly suggests this or that to me" means: I cannot teach you how to follow the line as I do. I do not assume that you will follow it as I do, even if you do follow it.

283. What does it mean to understand that something is an order, even if you do not yet understand the order itself? (“He means: I should do something – but I do not know what he wants.”)

284. The sentence "I must understand the order before I can act upon it" has, of course, a good meaning; but again not a metalogical one.

285. The idea that one has of understanding is that one thereby comes closer from the words to the execution. – In what sense is that correct?

286. “But I must understand an order in order to be able to act on it.” Here the “ must ” is suspect. –

Also consider the question: "How long before you obey the command must you understand it?"

287. "I cannot carry out the order because I do not understand what you mean. –– Yes, now I understand you." – What happened when I suddenly understood the other person? There were many possibilities. The order could, for example, have been given with the wrong emphasis; and suddenly the correct emphasis occurred to me. I would then say to a third person "Now I understand him, he means..." and repeat the order with the correct emphasis. And with the correct emphasis I would now understand it; that is, I would not have to grasp any further meaning (something outside the sentence, something ethereal), but the well-known German wording is completely sufficient for me. – Or the order was given to me in understandable German, but seemed inconsistent to me. Then an explanation occurred to me; and now I can carry it out. – Or several interpretations could have occurred to me, and I would finally decide on one of them.

288. If the command is not obeyed, then where is the shadow of its obeying which you thought you saw, because you had the form: He commands this and that .

289. If the connection of opinioncould be established before the command, then it can also be established after the command.

290. "He did what I ordered him." - Why should we not say here that there is an identity of action and words ?! Why should I put a shadow between the two? We have a method of projection. - Only it is a different identity: "I did what he did" and on the other hand "I did what he ordered."

291. One could call the projection rays the “connection of the image with the object depicted”; but also the technique of projection.

292. The ambiguity of our expression: If we were given an order in a code and the key to translating it into German, we could describe the process of forming the German order with the words: "from the code we have to do" or "to deduce what the observance of the order is." On the other hand, if we act according to the order, to follow it, then here too we can speak in certain cases of a deduction of the observance.

293. I give the rules of a game. The other person makes a move, entirely in accordance with these rules, the possibility of which I had not foreseen and which disrupts the game, as I intended. I must now say: "I have given bad rules"; I must change my rules or perhaps add to them.

So I already have a picture of the game in advance? In a sense: yes!

It was possible, for example, that I did not foresee that a quadratic equation does not necessarily have real solutions.

So the rule leads me to something about which I say: "I did not expect this picture; I always imagined a solution like this : ......"

294. In the one case we are making a move in an existing game, in the other we are laying down a rule for the game. One could also understand the act of moving a piece in two ways: as a paradigm for future moves, and as a move in a game.

295. You must remember that there can be a language game, 'continuing a series of figures', in which no rule, no expression of a rule is ever given, but learning takes place only through examples. So that the idea that every step can be justified by something - a kind of model - in our minds would be completely foreign to these people.

296. How strange: it seems as if a physical (mechanical) guide could fail, could allow the unexpected, but a rule could not! It would be, so to speak, the only reliable guide. But what is it that makes a guide not allow a movement, and what makes a rule not allow it? - How do you know the one and the other?

297. "How do I always use a word correctly, that is, sensibly? Do I always look up the grammar? No; the fact that I mean something - what I mean - prevents me from saying nonsense." - "I mean something with the words" here means: I know that I can use them.

But I can believe that I can apply them, and it turns out that I was wrong.

298. It does not follow from this that understanding is the activity by which we demonstrate our understanding. The question whether it is this activity is misleading. It must not be understood as follows : "Is understanding then this activity - is it not another one ? " - but as follows: "If 'understanding' is used to designate this activity, is it not used in a different way ?"

299. We say: "If you really follow the rule when multiplying, the same result must come out." Now, if this is only the somewhat hysterical expression of university language, it need not interest us very much. But it is the expression of an attitude towards the technique of calculation which is evident everywhere in our lives. The emphasis on the must only corresponds to the inexorability of this attitude, both towards the technique of calculation and towards innumerable related exercises.

300. With the words: " This number is the logical continuation of this series," I could persuade someone to call this and that "logical continuation" in the future. What "this and that" is, I can only show by examples. That is, I teach him to continue a series (basic series) without using an expression of the "law of series"; rather, in order to obtain a substrate for the meaning of algebraic rules, or something similar to them.

301. He must continue like this without reason . But not because the reason cannot yet be made comprehensible to him, but because – in this system – there is no reason. (“The chain of reasons has an end.”)

And the so (in "continue so") is designated by a number, a value. Because at this level the rule expression is explained by the value, not the value by the rule.

302. For where it is said, "But don't you see ...?" the rule is of no use; it is something explained, not something that explains.

303. "He understands the rule intuitively." - But why the rule? And not how he should now continue?

304. "If he has only seen the right thing, the one of the infinite number of relationships that I am trying to explain to him, - if he has only grasped it once, he will now continue the series correctly without further ado. I admit that he can only guess (intuitively guess) this relationship that I mean - but if he succeeds, then the game is won." - But this correct thing that I mean does not exist. The comparison is wrong. There is no cog here that he is supposed to grasp, the right machine that, once chosen, automatically takes him further. It could be that something like this takes place in our brain, but that is not of interest to us.

305. "Do the same!" But in doing so I must point to the rule. He must therefore have already learned to apply it . Otherwise, what does its expression mean to him?

306. To guess the meaning of the rule, to grasp it intuitively, could only mean to guess its application . And that cannot mean to guess the manner , the rule, of its application. And there is no question of guessing here at all.

307. For example, I could guess which continuation would please the other person (for example, based on his face). One could only guess the application of the rule if one could already choose between different applications.

308. One could then imagine that instead of 'guessing the application of the rule', he invents it . Well, what would that look like? - Should he say: 'Following the rule + 1 means writing: 1, 1+1, 1+1+1, etc.'? But what does he mean by that? The 'etc.' already presupposes the mastery of a technique.

Instead of "etc." he could have said, "You know what I mean." And his explanation would have simply been a definition of the expression "follow the rule + 1." That would have been his "invention."

309. We copy the digits from 1 to 100 and conclude , think in this way.

I could put it like this: If I copy the digits from 1 to 100, how do I know that I will get a series of digits that will be correct when counting? And what is a check for what ? Or how should I describe the important empirical fact here? Should I say that experience teaches me that I always count the same way? Or that no digit is lost when copying? Or that the digits remain as they are on the paper even when I am not looking at them? Or all of these facts? Or should I say that we simply do not get into trouble? Or that everything seems to be OK almost all the time?

This is how we think. This is how we act. This is how we talk about it.

310. Suppose you were to describe how people learn to count (in the decimal system, for example). You describe what the teacher says and does, and how the student reacts to it. In what the teacher says and does, you will find, for example, words and gestures intended to encourage the student to continue a series; also words such as "He can now count." Should the description that I give of the process of teaching and learning contain not only the teacher's words but also my own judgment: the student can now count or the student has now understood the system of number words? If I do not include such a judgment in the description, is it then incomplete? And if I do include it, do I go beyond the mere description? Can I refrain from making those judgments on the grounds: " That is all that happens "?

311. Should I not rather ask: "What does the description actually do? What is its purpose?" - We know what a complete and an incomplete description is, however, in another context. Ask yourself: How do we use the expressions "complete" and "incomplete description"?

Reproducing a speech completely (or incompletely). Does this include reproducing the tone of voice, facial expressions, the authenticity or inauthenticity of the feelings, the intentions of the speaker, the effort of speaking? Whether this or that is part of a complete description for us will depend on the purpose of the description, on what the recipient does with the description.

312. The expression "That is all that happens " delimits what we call "happening."

313. Here the temptation to say something more, when everything has already been described, is overwhelming. – Where does this urge come from? What analogy, what false interpretation produces it?

314. Here we come across a strange and characteristic phenomenon in philosophical investigations: the difficulty - I could say - is not in finding the solution, but in recognizing as the solution something which looks as if it were only a preliminary stage to it. "We have already said everything. - Not something which follows from this, but precisely that is the solution!"

I think this is because we mistakenly expect an explanation, whereas a description is the solution to the difficulty if we place it correctly in our consideration. If we dwell on it and do not try to go beyond it.

The difficulty here is to stop.

315. "Why do you demand explanations? When these are given, you will be faced with an end again. They cannot take you any further than you are now."

316. One can use a red object as a model for painting a reddish white or a reddish yellow (etc.) – but can one also use it as a model for painting a blue-green shade, for example? – What if I saw someone 'reproducing' a red spot blue-green with all the external signs of exact copying? – I would say "I don't know how he does it!" Or even "I don't know what he does!" – But suppose he now 'copied' this shade of red on various occasions into blue-green and perhaps other shades of red regularly into other blue-green shades – should I now say that he is copying or that he is not copying?

But what does it mean that I do not know 'what he is doing'? Do I not see what he is doing? - But I do not see into him . - Except not this analogy! If I see him copying red into red - what do I know then? Do I know how I am doing it? Of course, one says: I am just painting the same colour. - But what if he says "And I am painting the fifth to this colour"? Do I see a special process of mediation when I paint the 'same' colour?

Suppose I know him to be an honest man; he renders a red by a blue-green, as I have described it - but not the same tone always by the same tone, but now by one tone, now by another. - Should I say "I do not know what he does"? - He does what I see - but I would never do it; I do not know why he does it; his way of acting "is incomprehensible to me."

317. One could imagine a negative portrait, that is one that is intended to represent what Mr. N. does not look like (which is therefore a bad portrait if it resembles Mr. N.).

318. I cannot describe how to use a rule (in general) except by teaching you to use a rule.

319. I can now, for example, record such a lesson in a spoken film. The teacher will sometimes say, "That's right." If the student asks him, "Why?", he will not answer, or at least not with anything relevant, not even, "Well, because we all do it that way." That will not be the reason.

320. Why do I not call the rules of cooking arbitrary, and why am I tempted to call the rules of grammar arbitrary? Because 'cooking' is defined by its purpose, whereas 'speaking' is not. Therefore the use of language is autonomous in a certain sense in which cooking and washing are not. Anyone who follows rules other than the correct ones when cooking is cooking badly; but anyone who follows rules other than those of chess is playing a different game ; and anyone who follows grammatical rules other than such and such is not speaking falsely, but about something else.

321. If one adds a rule concerning a word of the sentence to the sentence, its meaning does not change.

322. Language is not defined for us as an institution that serves a specific purpose. Rather, "language" is for us a collective term, and by this I understand the German language, the English language, etc., and various sign systems that have a greater or lesser relationship to these languages.

323. Our knowledge of many languages ​​prevents us from taking seriously the philosophy contained in the forms of each one. But we are blind to the fact that we ourselves have strong prejudices for and against certain forms of expression, and that this particular superposition of several languages ​​creates a certain picture for us.

324. Does the child only learn to speak or also to think? Does he learn the meaning of multiplication before or after multiplication?

325. How did I come to the concept of 'sentence' or the concept of 'language'? Only through the languages ​​that I have learned. – But they seem to have led me beyond myself in a certain sense, because I am now able to construct a new language, for example to invent words. – So this construction still belongs to the concept of language. But only if I want to define it as such.

326. The concept of a living being has the same indeterminacy as that of language.

327. Compare: inventing a game – inventing a language – inventing a machine.

328. The fact that such and such a sentence has no meaning is important in philosophy; but so is the fact that it sounds funny.

329. I make a plan not only to make myself understandable to others, but also to become clear about the matter myself. (That is, language is not just a means of communication.)

330. What does it mean: "It's not the same game anymore!" How do I use this sentence? As a message? Well, perhaps as an introduction to a message that lists the differences and explains their consequences. But also to express that I am no longer taking part in this, or at least that I have a different attitude to the game.

331. One is tempted to justify the rules of grammar by sentences of the type "But there really are four primary colors." And against the possibility of this justification, which is built on the model of justifying a sentence by pointing to its verification, is the statement that the rules of grammar are arbitrary.

But can one not say in some sense that the grammar of color words characterizes the world as it actually is? One might say: Can I not really search in vain for a fifth primary color? Do we not put the primary colors together because they have a similarity; or at least the colors , in contrast to, for example, the shapes or tones, because they have a similarity? Or do I, when I present this division of the world as the correct one, already have a preconceived idea as a paradigm in my head? Of which I can then only say: "Yes, that is the way we look at things," or "We want to make a picture like that." For if I say: "The primary colors do have a certain similarity to one another," where do I get the concept of this similarity? Just as the concept of "primary color" is nothing other than "blue or red or green or yellow," is not the concept of that similarity also given only by the four colors? – Yes, aren't they the same? – »Yes, could you put red, green and circular together?« – Why not?!

332. Do not think that you hold the concept of colour within you because you look at a coloured object, however you look.

(Just as you don't have the concept of a negative number because you have debts.)

333. "Red is something specific" would mean something like "That is something specific" - whereby one points to something red. But for that to be understandable, one would have to mean our concept "red", the use of that pattern.

334. I can clearly express an expectation in one case with the words "I expect a red circle," and in another case with the colored image of a red circle instead of the last two words. But in this expression the two words "red" and "circle" do not correspond to two things. So the expression in the second language is of a completely different kind .

335. In addition to this, there is also a language in which ›red circle‹ is expressed by juxtaposing a circle and a red spot.

336. Even if I have two symbols with me, the expression "red circle" and the colored picture, or the idea of ​​the red circle, the question would still be: How is the one word then associated with the color and the other with the form?

Because it seems that one word draws attention to the color, the other to the shape. But what does that mean? How can these words be translated into this image?

Or: If the word "red" brings a color to mind, it must be associated with a form; how can I then abstract from the form?

The important question is never: how does he know what he should abstract from? but rather: how is that even possible? or: what does it mean?

337. Perhaps it will become clearer if we compare the two languages, in one of which a red tablet and one with a circle on it (say a black one on a white background) replace the words "red circle"; and in the other a red circle is drawn instead.

How does the translation work here? He first looks at the red tablet and chooses a red pen, then at the circle, and then draws a circle with this pen.

For example, we would first learn that the first tablet always determines the choice of pencil, and the second what we should draw with it. The two tablets therefore belong to different parts of speech (such as noun and verb). But in the other language there would be nothing that could be called two words.

338. If someone said, "Red is a composite," we could not guess what he was alluding to, what he would want to do with this sentence. But if he says, "This chair is a composite," we may not immediately know what composite he is talking about, but we can immediately think of more than one sense for his statement.

Now what kind of fact is this that I have pointed out?

In any case, it is an important fact. – We are not aware of any technology to which this sentence could allude.

339. Here we are describing a language game which we cannot learn .

340. "Then something quite different must be happening in him, something we do not know." - This shows us how we determine whether something different or the same as what is happening in us is happening in the other person. This shows us how we judge inner processes.

341. Can you imagine what the red-green blind person sees? Can you paint a picture of the room as he sees it?

Can he paint it as he sees it? So can I paint it as I see it? In what sense can I?

342. "Anyone who sees everything only grey, black and white would have to be given something so that he would know what red, green, etc. is." And what would have to be given him? Well, the colors. So, for example, this and this and this . (Imagine, for example, that colored models would have to be introduced into his brain in addition to the purely grey and black ones.) But would that have to happen as a means to the end of future action? Or does this very action include these models? Do I mean: "He would have to be given something, for it is clear that he could not otherwise..." - or: His seeing behavior contains new components?

343. Also: what would we call an "explanation of seeing" ? Should one say: Well, you know what "explanation" means; so use this term here too!

344. Can I say: "Look at it! You will see that it cannot be explained." Or: "Drink the color red into yourself and you will see that it cannot be represented by anything else!" And if the other person agrees with me, does that show that he has drunk the same thing as I have? And what does our inclination to say this mean? Red appears to us to stand alone. Why? What is this appearance, this inclination, worth ?

But one might ask: To what peculiarity of the concept does this inclination of ours point?

345. Think about the sentence “Red is not a mixed color” and its function.

The language game with colors is characterized by what we can do and what we cannot do.

346. “There is no such thing as reddish green” is related to the sentences we use as axioms in mathematics.

347. The fact that we calculate with certain conceptsand not with others only shows how different the conceptual tools are (how little reason we have to assume uniformity here). [ Marginal note: On statements about colors that are similar to mathematical ones, e.g.: Blue is darker than white. See Goethe's theory of colors.]

348. “The possibility of agreement already requires agreement .” – Imagine someone saying: “Being able to play chess is a kind of chess”!

349. It is very difficult to describe the paths of thought where there are already many ruts - whether your own or others - and not to get into one of the well-worn paths. It is difficult to deviate only a little from an old rut of thought.

350. "It is as if our concepts were conditioned by a framework of facts."

That meant: If you imagine certain facts differently, describe them differently than they are, then you can no longer imagine the application of certain concepts, because the rules for their application have no analogue under the new circumstances. What I am saying therefore comes down to this : A law is given for people, and a lawyer may well be able to draw conclusions for every case that usually occurs to him, so the law obviously has its use, a meaning. Nevertheless, its validity presupposes all sorts of things; and if the being he has to judge differs completely from the ordinary person, then, for example, the decision as to whether he committed an act with malicious intent will not be difficult, but (simply) impossible.

351. "If people did not generally agree about the colors of things, if disagreements were not exceptions, our concept of color could not exist." No: - our concept of color would not exist.

352. Do I want to say, then, that certain facts are favorable or unfavorable to certain conceptual formations? And does experience teach this? It is a fact of experience that people change their concepts when they learn new facts; when something that was previously important to them becomes unimportant and vice versa. (For example, one finds that what was previously considered a difference in kind is actually only a difference in degree.)

353. But can one not say: "If there were only one substance, there would be no use for the word 'substance'"? But that means: The concept 'substance' presupposes the concept 'difference of substance'. (As that of the chess king presupposes that of the chess move, or as that of the color presupposes that of the colors .)

354. Between green and red, I mean to say, there is a geometrical void, not a physical one.

355. But does this not correspond to anything physical? I do not deny that. (Even if it is merely our habituation to these concepts, to these language games. But I am not saying that it is so.) If we teach a person this or that technique by example, the fact that he then goes in this way and not in that way with a certain new case , or that he then stops, that for him this and not that is the 'natural' continuation, is in itself a highly important natural fact.

356. "But if I mean green by 'bluish yellow', then I am interpreting this expression differently from the original way. The original interpretation indicates a different and not viable way."

But what is the right analogy here? That of the physically impassable path, or that of the non-existence of the path? So the analogy of physical or mathematical impossibility?

357. We have a system of colors like a system of numbers.

Are systems in our nature or in the nature of things? How should we put it? Not in the nature of numbers or colors.

358. Is there anything arbitrary about this system? Yes and no. It is related to the arbitrary and to the non-arbitrary.

359. It is obvious at first glance that one wants to recognize nothing but intermediate colors between red and green. (And whether it has always been obvious to me or only after experience and education is irrelevant.)

360. 'a is between b and c, and closer to b than to c', this is a characteristic relation between sensations of the same kind. That is, there is, for example, a language game with the command 'Create a sensation between this and this , and closer to the first than the second!' and also 'Name two sensations between which this one lies'.

361. And here it is important that, for example, for grey one will get the answer "black and white"; for violet "blue and red", for pink "red and white" etc.; but not for olive green "red and green".

362. People know a reddish green. – “But there is n’t one!” – What a strange sentence. – (How do you know?)

363. Let's put it this way: do these people have to notice the discrepancy? Perhaps they are too stupid to do so. And then again: perhaps not. –

364. Yes, but does nature have no say in this?! Yes, it does – it just makes itself heard in a different way.

»At some point you will come up against existence and non-existence!« But that means facts , not concepts.

365. It is a fact of the highest importance that a colour which we are inclined to call (for example) "reddish yellow" can really be produced by mixing (in various ways) red and yellow. And that we are not able to recognise without further ado a colour which has been produced by mixing red and green as one which can be produced in this way. (But what does "without further ado" mean here?)

366. Confusion of tastes: I say "That's sweet," the other says "That's sour," and so on. Someone comes along and says: "None of you have a clue what you're talking about. You don't even know what you once called a taste." What would be the sign that we still know it? (Related to a question about confusion in arithmetic.)

367. But could we not also play a language game in this ›confusion‹? – But is it still the former? –

368. Let us imagine people who express an intermediate color between red and yellow, for example, using a kind of binary decimal fraction like this: R,LLRL, etc., where on the right side there is yellow, on the left side red. These people learn in kindergarten to describe colors in this way, to select colors based on such descriptions, to mix them, etc. They behave towards us in a similar way to how people with perfect pitch behave towards people who lack this. They can do what we cannot.

369. And here one would like to say: "But is that even conceivable? Yes, the behavior certainly! But also the inner process, the experience of color?" And it is difficult to see what one should say to such a question. Could those who do not have perfect pitch have suspected that there would also be people with perfect pitch?

370. The gloss or reflection: When a child paints, he will never paint these. Indeed, it is almost difficult to believe that they can be represented by ordinary oil or water colours.

371. What would a society of deaf people look like? What, a society of 'mentally feeble' people? Important question! What would a society look like that never played many of our usual language games?

372. The feeble-minded person is imagined in the image of someone degenerate, essentially incomplete, in a state of raggedness, and thus in the image of disorder rather than of the more primitive order (which would be a far more productive way of looking at things).

We simply do not see a society of such people.

373. Other concepts, although related to ours, might appear very strange to us; namely, deviations from the usual in an unusual direction .

374. Fixed concepts would require uniformity of behavior. But where I am certain , the other is uncertain. And that is a fact of nature.

375. These are the fixed rails on which all our thinking runs, and therefore also our judgment and action.

376. For example, where a type is rare, the concept of this type is not formed. People do not perceive it as a unity, as a specific face.

377. They do not take a picture of it and recognize it from case to case.

378. Must the concept of modesty or boastfulness be known everywhere where there are modest and boastful people? Perhaps they do not care about this distinction.

Some differences are unimportant to us and could be important to us.

379. And others have concepts that cut through our concepts.

380. A tribe has two concepts related to our 'pain'. One is used for visible injuries and is associated with care, pity, etc. The other is used for stomachaches, for example, and is associated with amusement at the complainant. 'But don't they really notice the similarity?' - Do we have a concept everywhere where there is a similarity? The question is: is the similarity important to them ? And does it have to be? And why shouldn't their concept overlap with our concept 'pain'?

381. But does he not then overlook something that is there? – He takes no notice of it; and why should he? – But then his concept is fundamentally different from ours. – Fundamentally different? Different. – But then it is as if his word could not designate the same thing as ours. Or only a part of it. – But that is how it must look if his concept is different. For the indeterminacy of our concept can project itself for us into the object that the word designates. So that, if the indeterminacy were missing, it would not 'mean the same thing' either. The image we use symbolizes the indeterminacy.

382. In philosophy, one must not cut off any disease of thought . It must follow its natural course, and the slow healing is the most important thing. (Hence mathematicians are such bad philosophers.)

383. Imagine that the people of a tribe were brought up from early childhood not to show any expression of emotion. For them, it is something childish that should be discarded. The training is strict. One does not speak of 'pain'; and certainly not in the form of a suggestion: 'Perhaps he did...'. If someone complains, he is laughed at or punished. There is no suspicion of pretense. Complaining is, so to speak, pretense.

384. "Pretense," those people might say, "what a ridiculous term!" (As if one were differentiating between a murder with one bullet and one with three bullets.)

385. Complaining is already so bad that there is no worse thing than pretending.

386. One disgrace stands before them before another, but they cannot see it.

387. I mean: an education quite different from ours could also be the basis of quite different concepts.

388. Because life would be different here. What interests us would not interest them . Other concepts would no longer be unimaginable. In fact, essentially different concepts are only imaginable in this way.

389. One could simply teach [someone] to mimic pain (for example) (not with the intention of deceiving). But could it be taught to everyone? I mean: He could certainly learn to give out certain crude signs of pain, but without ever giving a more subtle imitation of his own accord, from his own insight. (Language talent.) (One could perhaps teach a clever dog a kind of howl of pain; but he would never be able to imitate it consciously.)

390. 'These people have nothing human-like about them.' Why? - We could not possibly communicate with them. Not even in the way we can with a dog. We could not find ourselves in them.

And yet there could be such beings, which are actually human.

391. What I actually want to say is that intellectual scruples begin in instinct (have their roots). Or also like this: the language game does not have its origin in reflection . Reflection is a part of the language game.

And the term is therefore at home in language games.

392. ›Sandpile‹ is a vaguely defined concept –– but why not use a sharply defined one instead? – Does the reason lie in the nature of the piles? What phenomenon is it whose nature is decisive for our concept?

393. It is easy to imagine and describe in detail events which, if we were to see them happen, would make us confused in all our judgment.

If I were to see a completely new environment from my window instead of the old one, if things, people and animals behaved in a way they have never behaved before, I would say something like "I've gone mad"; but that would only be an expression of my giving up on knowing what I'm doing. And the same thing could happen to me in mathematics. For example, it could seem to me as if I were constantly making calculation errors, so that no solution seemed reliable to me.

But the important thing for me is that there is no clear boundary between such a state and the normal one.

394. What would it mean to be mistaken in saying that he has a soul, consciousness? And what would it mean for me to be mistaken and not have one myself? What would it mean to say "I am not conscious"? -- But do I not know that consciousness is in me? -- So I know it, and yet the statement that it is so has no purpose?

And how strange that one can learn to communicate with other people on this matter!

395. One can pretend to be unconscious, but also conscious ?

396. What if someone told me in all seriousness that he (really) did not know whether he was dreaming or awake? –

Can there be a situation like this: someone says, "I think I'm dreaming now"; he actually wakes up soon afterwards, remembers that statement in the dream and says, "So I was right!" –– This story can only mean that someone dreamed that he said he was dreaming.

Imagine if an unconscious person said (perhaps under anesthesia) “I am conscious” – would we say “He must know”?

And if someone were to say in his sleep, “I am sleeping,” would we say, “He is quite right”?

Is someone telling an untruth if he tells me, "I am unconscious"? (And is he telling the truth if he says it while unconscious? And what if a parrot said, "I don't understand a word," or a gramophone said, "I am just a machine"?)

397. Suppose that in a daydream I let myself say, "I am merely fantasizing," would that be true ? Suppose that I write such a fantasy or story, an imagined dialogue, and in it I say, "I am fantasizing" -- but when I write it down, how does it become apparent that these words are words of the imagination and that I have not stepped out of the imagination?

Would it not really be possible for the dreamer, stepping out of the dream, so to speak, to say in his sleep "I am dreaming"? It would certainly be conceivable that such a language game existed.

This is connected with the problem of 'meaning'. For I can write in the dialogue of a piece "I am healthy" and therefore not cry , even though it is also true. The words belong to this and not to that language game.

398. 'True' and 'False' in dreams. I dream that it is raining and that I say "It is raining" –– on the other hand: I dream that I say "I am dreaming".

399. Does the verb "to dream" have a present tense? How do people learn to use it?

400. Suppose I had an experience similar to waking up, but then found myself in a completely different environment, with people who assure me that I was asleep. Suppose further that I maintain that I was not dreaming, but was somehow living outside my sleeping body. What is the function of this assertion?

401.  "'I have consciousness' is a statement about which no doubt is possible." Why should that not say the same thing as this: "'I have consciousness' is not a sentence"?

One could also say: What harm does it do if someone says that "I have consciousness" is a statement that admits of no doubt? How can I contradict him? Suppose someone said this to me - why should I not get used to not answering him, instead of starting an argument? Why should I not treat his words like his whistling or humming?

402. "Nothing is so certain as that I have consciousness." Why then should I not let it rest? This certainty is like a great force whose point of action does not move, and which therefore does no work.

403. Remember: most people say that you don't feel anything when you're under anesthesia. But some people say that you could still feel something and just completely forget about it.

So if there are those who doubt and those who have no doubt, the lack of doubt could also exist much more generally.

404. Or doubt might have another, and much less indeterminate, form than in our world of thought.

405. No one but a philosopher would say, "I know that I have two hands," but one may say, "I am not in a position to doubt that I have two hands."

406. But "knowledge" is not usually used in this sense. "I know what 97 × 78 is." "I know that 97 × 78 is 432." In the first case I tell someone that I can do something, that I possess something; in the second I simply assure them that 97 × 78 is 432. Doesn't "97 × 78 is definitely 432" mean that I know it to be so? The first proposition is not an arithmetical one, nor can one replace it; instead of the second one one could use an arithmetical proposition.

407. Can someone believe that 25 × 25 = 625? What does it mean to believe that? How does one show that he believes that?

408. But is there not a phenomenon of knowledge, so to speak, quite apart from the meaning of the words "I know"? Is it not strange that a man can know something , can have the fact, as it were, within himself? - But that is a false picture. - For, it is said, knowledge is only if it really is as he says. But that is not enough. It must not be so merely by chance. For he must know that he knows: knowledge is his own state of mind: he cannot - except through a special blindness - be in doubt or wrong about it. If, then, the knowledge that it is so is only knowledge if it really is so; and if the knowledge is in him, so that he cannot be mistaken about whether it is knowledge, then he is also infallible in that it is as he knows the knowledge; and therefore the fact that he knows must be like the knowledge in him.

And that does point to a possible way of using "I know." "I know that it is so" then means: It is so or I am crazy.

Therefore, if I say, without lying, "I know that it is so," I can only be wrong because of a special blindness.

409. How is it that doubt is not subject to arbitrary choice? – And if so, – could not a child, by his strange disposition, doubt everything?

410. One can only doubt when one has learned certain things, just as one can only make a mistake in one's calculations when one has learned to calculate. Then it is indeed involuntary.

411. Imagine a child is particularly clever, so clever that you can teach him straight away the doubtful nature of the existence of all things. So he learns from the beginning: "That is probably a chair."

And how does it learn to ask the question: “Is this really an armchair?”

412. Do I practice child psychology? – I connect the concept of teaching with the concept of meaning.

413. One is a convinced realist, the other a convinced idealist, and teaches his children accordingly. In such an important matter as the existence or non-existence of the external world, they do not want to teach their children anything wrong.

What will they be taught now? To say this too: "There are physical objects," or the opposite?

If someone does not believe in fairies, he need not teach his children "There are no fairies," but he can refrain from teaching them the word "fairy." On what occasion should they say "There is..." or "There is not..."? Only when they meet people who have an opposing belief.

414. But the idealist will teach the children the word "chair," because he wants to teach them to do this and that, for example, to fetch a chair. So how will what the children brought up in an idealistic way say differ from what the realistic ones say? Will the difference not only be that of the battle cries?

415. Doesn't the game "This is probably a..." begin with disappointment? And can the first attitude be towards possible disappointment?

416. "So you have to teach him a false sense of security first?"

Their language game does not yet involve any talk of security or insecurity. Remember: they are learning to do something .

417. The language game "What is that?" - "An armchair." - is not the same as: "What do you think that is?" - "It might be an armchair."

418. There is no point in teaching someone at the beginning, "That looks red." He will have to say that spontaneously once he has learned what "red" means, that is, the technique of using the word.

419. The basis of every explanation is training. (Educators should keep this in mind.)

420. "It seems red to me." - "And what is red?" - " So ." The correct paradigm must be pointed out.

421. When he first learns the names of colors, what is he taught? Well, he learns, for example, to call out "red" when he sees something red. - But is that the right description, or should it have been: "He learns to call 'red' what we also call 'red'"? - Both descriptions are correct.

How does the language game “How does it seem to you?” differ from this?

You could teach someone the color words by letting them look at white objects through colored glasses. But what I teach them has to be a skill . So now they can bring something red on command, or sort objects according to their colors. But what is something red?

422. Why do we not first teach the child the language game "It seems red to me"? Because it is not yet capable of understanding the finer difference between appearance and reality?

423. The red facial sensation is a new term .

424. The language game that we then teach him is: "It seems to me ...., it seems to you ...." In the first language game a person does not appear as a perceiving subject.

425. You give the language game a new hinge. But that does not mean that it will always be used.

426. The inner view of the sensation - what connection should it establish between word and sensation; and what purpose should this connection serve? Was that taught to me when I learned to use this sentence, to think this thought? (Thinking it is something I had to learn.)

We do, however, learn to direct our attention to things and sensations. We learn to observe and to describe the observation. But how is this taught to me? How is my 'inner activity' controlled in this case? How is it judged whether I have really paid attention?

427. "The chair is the same whether I look at it or not" - that does n't have to be true. People often get embarrassed when you look at them. "The chair continues to exist whether I look at it or not." That could be an empirical statement, or it could be understood grammatically. But you can also simply think of the conceptual difference between sensory impression and object.

428. But isn't the agreement between people essential to the game? So, whoever learns it mustn't first know the meaning of "equal," and doesn't that also presuppose agreement? And so on.

429. You say " That is red," but how do you decide whether you are right? Doesn't it depend on the agreement of people? - But do I then rely on this agreement in my color judgments? Does it then work like this : I let a number of people look at an object; each of them thinks of one of a certain group of words (the so-called color words); if the majority of the observers thought of the word "red," for example (I myself do not have to belong to this majority), then the object deserves the predicate "red." Such a technique could have its importance.

430. The color words are taught like this : "That is red," for example. Our language game only comes about if a certain agreement prevails, but the concept of agreement does not enter into the language game. If the agreement were perfect, its concept could be completely unknown.

431. Does the consensus of people decide what is red? Is it decided by appeal to the majority? Were we taughtto determine the color this way ?

432. I am describing the language game "Bring something red" to someone who can already play it. I could only teach it to others. (Relativity.)

433. "What I perceive is this - " and now follows a form of description . The word "this" could also be explained as follows: Let us imagine a direct transfer of the experience! - But what is our criterion for the fact that the experience was really transferred? "Well, he has just what I have." - But how does he ' have ' it?

434. What does it mean to "designate or name a sensation with a word"? Is there nothing to investigate?

Imagine you're starting from a language game with physical objects - and now you're told that sensations are now also being named. Wouldn't that be like first talking about a transfer of ownership and then suddenly about a transfer of the joy of ownership or the pride in ownership? Don't we have to learn something new? Something new that we also call "transferring."

435. The description of what is subjectively seen is closely or distantly related to the description of an object, but for that reason does not function as a description of an object. How do you compare visual sensations? How do I compare my visual sensations with those of others?

436. "Verifying by inspection" is a completely misleading expression. It says that a process, inspection, takes place first, and that is comparable to looking through a microscope or to the process of turning one's head to see something . And that seeing must then take place. One could speak of "seeing by turning" or "seeing by looking". But then turning (or looking) is a process external to seeing, which therefore only interests us practically. What one wants to say is "seeing by seeing".

437. The reasons why we believe a sentence are certainly irrelevant to the question of what it is that we believe; but not the reasons, which are grammatically related to the sentence and tell us who it is.

438. Nothing is more common than for the meaning of an expression to fluctuate in such a way that a phenomenon is sometimes regarded as a symptom and sometimes as a criterion of a state of affairs. And in such a case the change in meaning is usually not noticed. In science it is usual to make phenomena which can be measured precisely into defining criteria of an expression; and one is then inclined to think that the real meaning has now been found . A great deal of confusion has arisen in this way.

There are, for example, degrees of pleasure, but it is foolish to talk of measuring pleasure. It is true that in certain cases a measurable phenomenon takes the place previously occupied by an immeasurable one. The word which designates this place then changes its meaning, and its old meaning becomes more or less obsolete. People then reassure themselves by thinking that one concept is the more precise, the other the less precise, and they do not notice that in each particular case there is a different relationship between the 'precise' and the 'inexact'. It is the old mistake of not examining the particular cases.

439. Sufficient evidence, without having definite limits, passes into insufficient evidence. Should I say that a natural basis for this conception is the complex nature and variety of human cases?

So, with a much smaller diversity, a sharply defined concept formation would seem natural. And why does it seem so difficult to imagine the simplified case?

440. How should we imagine a complete list of rules for the use of a word? - What is meant by a complete list of rules for the use of a piece in chess? Could we not always construct doubtful cases in which the normal list of rules does not decide? Think of a question like this: how can one determine who moved last when the reliability of the players' memories is in doubt?

Traffic regulation in the streets permits and prohibits certain actions by drivers and pedestrians, but it does not attempt to regulate all their movements. And it would be pointless to talk about an 'ideal' traffic regulation that would do that; we would not know what this ideal would mean. If someone wishes to make the traffic regulation stricter in certain respects, this does not mean that he wishes to bring it closer to an ideal.

441. Consider this sentence too: "The rules of a game can allow a certain amount of freedom, but they must be very specific rules." That is like saying: "You can allow a person a certain amount of freedom of movement through four walls, but the walls must be completely rigid" - and that is not true. "Well, the walls can be elastic, but then they have a very specific elasticity." - What does that say? It seems to say that one must be able to specify this elasticity, but that is not true. "The wall always has a certain elasticity - whether I know it or not": that is actually a commitment to a form of expression. One that uses the form of an ideal of precision. As a parameter of representation, so to speak.

442. The commitment to a form of expression, when it is expressed in the disguise of a proposition which deals with objects (instead of with the sign), must be ' a priori '. For its opposite becomes really unthinkable insofar as it corresponds to a form of thought, a form of expression which we have excluded.

443. Suppose that people always used to point to objects in such a way that they described a circle around the object with their finger in the air; then one could imagine a philosopher saying: "All things are circular; for the table looks like this , the stove like this , the lamp like this ," etc., while each time drawing a circle around the thing.

444. We now have a theory ; a 'dynamic theory' [3] of the sentence, of language, but it does not appear to us as a theory. It is the characteristic of such a theory that it looks at a particular, clearly visible case and says: " This shows how things are in general; this case is the archetype of all cases." -- "Of course! That must be the case," we say, and are satisfied. We have arrived at a form of representation that makes sense to us . But it is as if we have now seen something that lies beneath the surface.

The tendency to generalize the clear case seems to have its strict justification in logic: one seems to conclude here with full justification: "If a proposition is an image, then every proposition must be an image, for they must all be of the same essence." For we are under the illusion that the sublime, essential aspect of our investigation consists in its grasping an all-embracing essence.

445. How can I understand the sentence now if the analysis is supposed to be able to show what I actually understand? – Here the idea of ​​understanding as a strange mental process comes into play.

446. Don't even think of understanding as a 'mental process'! - Because that is the way of speaking that confuses you. Instead, ask yourself: in what kind of case, under what kind of circumstances do we say 'now I know more' when the formula has occurred to us?

It is this way of speaking that prevents us from seeing the facts impartially. Consider the pronunciation of a word through the representation of its spelling! How easily one can convince oneself that two words - e.g. "für" and "führ" - have different sounds in everyday use - because they are pronounced differently - if one focuses one's attention on the difference in their spelling. This is comparable to the opinion that a violinist with a keen ear always plays f a little higher than eis. Consider such cases! - It can happen that the means of representation creates an illusion . Let us not think, then, that we have to find a specific mental process because the verb "verstehen" is there and because it is said that understanding is a mental activity.

447. The unrest in philosophy, one could say, comes from the fact that we view philosophy incorrectly, see it incorrectly, namely as if it were divided into (endless) longitudinal strips instead of (limited) transverse strips. This change in perception causes the greatest difficulty. So we want to grasp the unlimited strip, so to speak, and complain that it is not possible to do it piece by piece. Not, of course, if one understands a piece to be an endless longitudinal strip. But yes, if one understands a transverse strip. - But then we will not be able to finish our work! - Not, of course, because it does not have one.

(Instead of turbulent conjectures and explanations, we want to put calm consideration of linguistic facts.)

448. And does one say of the sentence "It is raining" that it says: it is like this and like that? What is the everyday use of this expression in ordinary language? For you have learned it from this use. If you now use it against its original use and think that you are still playing the old game with it, it is as if you were playing checkers with chess pieces and imagining that the game still had something of the spirit of chess.

449. Extension of a concept in a theory (e.g. wishful thinking).

450. Those who philosophize often make the wrong, inappropriate gesture in response to a verbal expression.

451. (One says the usual thing – with the wrong gesture.)

452. How is it that philosophy is such a complicated structure? It should be completely simple if it is that ultimate thing independent of all experience, which you say it is. Philosophy unravels knots in our thinking; therefore its result must be simple, but philosophizing must be as complicated as the knots it unravels.

453. (Just as one can sometimes reproduce music only in one's inner ear, but cannot whistle it, because the whistling drowns out the inner voice, so sometimes the voice of a philosophical thought is so quiet that it is drowned out by the noise of the spoken word and can no longer be heard when one is asked to speak.)

454. Plato: "- What? he says, it should not be of any use? For if temperance is the knowledge of knowledge and precedes other knowledge, then it must also precede this knowledge of the good and thus be of use to us. - Does it also make us healthy, I said, and not medicine? And the same with the other arts; does it perform the functions of the other arts and not rather each of them its own? Or have we not long ago admitted that it is only knowledge of knowledge and ignorance and of nothing else? - Certainly yes. - So it will not make us healthy? - Probably not. - Because health belongs to another art? - Yes. - So it will not bring us any benefit either, friend. For we have now assigned this function to another art too. - Certainly. - So how can temperance be of any use to us if it brings us no benefit at all?"

455. (The philosopher is not a citizen of a community of thought. That is what makes him a philosopher.)

456. Some philosophers (or whatever you call them) suffer from what you might call "loss of problems". Everything then seems very simple to them and there no longer seem to be any deep problems, the world becomes wide and flat and loses all depth, and what they write becomes infinitely shallow and trivial. Russell and HG Wells suffer from this.

457. .... quia plus loquitur inquisitio quam inventio .... (Augustine.)

458. Philosophical investigations: conceptual investigations. The essence of metaphysics: that it blurs the distinction between factual and conceptual investigations.

459. The fundamental expressed grammatically: What about the sentence "you cannot step into the same river twice"?

460. In a certain sense, one cannot be too careful with philosophical errors, they contain so much truth.

461. I would like you to say: "Yes, it is true, one could imagine that, it could also have happened!" But did I want to draw your attention to the fact that you are capable of imagining this? –– I wanted to put this image before your eyes, and your recognition of this image consists in the fact that you are now inclined to look at a given case differently: namely, to compare it with this series of images. I have changed your way of looking at things . (I have read somewhere that certain Indian mathematicians use a geometric figure to prove a theorem with the words: "Look at this!" This looking at it also causes a change in the way of looking at things.)

462. (The classifications of philosophers and psychologists: they classify clouds according to their shape.)

463. On mathematics: "You have a wrong concept. - But the matter cannot be cleared up by my railing against your words; but only by my attempting to direct your attention away from certain expressions, illustrations, ideas and towards the use of the words."

464. The family tree of psychological phenomena:I do not strive for exactness , but for clarity.

465. The treatment of all these phenomena of the psychic life is important to me, not because I am concerned with completeness, but because each onesheds light on the correct treatment of all .

466. And we are not dealing here with symptoms, but with logical criteria. The fact that these are not always clearly separated does not prevent them from being separated.

467. Our investigation does not seek to find the actual, exact meaning of words; but in the course of our investigation we often give exact meanings to words.

468. “Man thinks, fears, etc. etc.”: this is the answer one might give to someone who asked which chapters a book on psychology should contain.

469. Suppose someone says, "Man hopes." How could one describe this general phenomenon of natural history? - One could observe a child and wait until one day it expresses hope; and then one could say, "Today it has hoped for the first time." But that sounds strange! Although it would be quite natural to say, "Today it has said 'I hope' for the first time." And why strange? - One does not say of an infant that it hopes..., nor that it does not hope..., and yet one does say it of an adult. - Well, everyday life gradually becomes that in which there is room for hope.

But now people say: You can't be sure when the child really starts to hope, because hope is an internal process. What nonsense! How do you even know what you're talking about?

470. Or could he give an example like this : "I, for example, see, but am not blind"? That also sounds strange.

It would be correct to say: “And in me too you can observe the appearance of thinking, hoping, seeing, etc.”

471. The psychological verbs see, believe, think, wish do not denote phenomena. But psychology observes the phenomena of seeing, believing, thinking, wishing.

472. Plan for the treatment of psychological concepts.

Psychological verbs are characterized by the fact that the person of the present tense can be verified by observation, the first person cannot.

Sentence in the third person present tense: communication. In the first person present tense: statement. ((Not entirely true.))

The first person of the present tense is used in the utterance.

Sensory perceptions: their internal connections and analogies.

All have real duration. Possibility of specifying a beginning and an end. Possibility of simultaneity, of temporal coincidence.

All have degrees and qualitative mixtures. Degree: barely noticeable - unbearable.

In this sense, there is no sense of position or movement. Location of sensation on the body: distinguishes sight and hearing from sensations of pressure, temperature, taste and pain.

473. It must be remembered that there can be (and has probably existed) a state of language in which it does not possess the general concept of sensation, but nevertheless has words which correspond to our "see," "hear," and "taste."

474. We call sensory perceptions seeing, hearing, ..... There are analogies and connections between these concepts; they are our justification for this summary.

475. One can therefore ask: What connections and analogies exist between seeing and hearing? Between seeing and touching? Between seeing and smelling? Etc.

476. And if we ask this, our senses immediately become further apart than they seemed to be at first glance.

477. What do sense experiences have in common? – The answer that they teach us to know the external world is both a false and a correct one. It is correct insofar as it is intended to point to a logical criterion.

478. The duration of sensation. Compare the duration of a sound sensation with the duration of the tactile sensation which teaches you that you are holding a ball in your hand; and with the "feeling" which teaches you that your knees are bent.

479. We feel our movements. Yes, we really feel them; the sensation is not like a taste sensation or a heat sensation, but a touch sensation: the sensation when skin and muscles are pressed, pulled, moved.

480. I feel my arm and strangely enough I would now like to say: I feel it in space in a certain position; as if the bodily feeling were distributed in space in the shape of the arm, so that in order to represent it I would have to represent the arm in its correct position, perhaps in plaster.

481. Yes, it is strange. My forearm is now lying horizontally, and I would like to say that I feel it; but not as if I had a feeling that always goes along with this position (as if one felt bloodlessness or plethora, for example) – but as if the 'body feeling' of the arm were arranged or distributed horizontally, like a mist or dust particles on the surface of my arm are distributed in space. So it is not really as if I felt the position of my arm, but as if I felt my arm and the feeling was in such and such a position . But that is only: I simply know how it is lying – without knowing it, because .... Just as I know where I feel the pain – but don't know it, because ....

482. It is as if pain had a body, as if it were a thing, a body with shape and color. Why? Does it have the shape of the painful part of the body? One would like to say, for example: "I could describe the pain if only I had the necessary words and elementary meanings." One feels that one is lacking only the necessary nomenclature. (James.) As if one could even paint the sensation if only the other person understood this language. - And one can really describe the pain spatially and temporally.

483. (If sensations characterize the position of the limbs and the movements, their location is certainly not the joint.)

You know the position of your limbs and their movements . You can, for example, specify them when you are asked. Just as you know the location of a sensation (pain) on your body.

Reaction of touching the painful area.

There is no local characteristic in the sensation. Just as there is no temporal characteristic in the memory image. (Temporal characteristics in the photograph.)

Pain is distinguished from other sensory sensations by its characteristic expression. Therefore related to joy (which is not a sensory sensation).

484. Is it quibbling over words: – Joy, pleasure, delight are not sensations? – Let us ask ourselves: How much analogy is there between delight and what we call, for example, “sensory sensations”?

485. The link between them would be pain, for its concept resembles that of tactile sensation, for example (through the characteristics of localization, real duration, intensity, quality) and at the same time that of emotions through expression (facial expressions, gestures, sounds).

486. "I feel great joy." - Where? - That sounds absurd. And yet one also says "I feel a joyful excitement in my chest." - But why is joy not localized? Is it because it is distributed over the whole body? Nor is it localized when, for example, the feeling that it evokes is this; when we rejoice at the smell of a flower, for example. Joy is expressed in the facial expression, in behavior. (But we do not say that we rejoiced in our faces.)

487. "But I have a real feeling of joy!" Yes, when you are happy, you are really happy. And of course joy is not joyful behavior, nor is it a feeling around the corners of the mouth and eyes.

"But 'joy' means something internal." No. "Joy" means nothing. Neither internal nor external.

488. Continuation of the classification of psychological concepts.

Emotions. What they have in common is a real duration, a course. (Anger flares up, subsides, disappears; likewise: joy, depression, fear.)

Difference from sensations: they are not localized (not even diffuse!).

What they have in common is that they have a characteristic expressive behavior. (Facial expression.) And from this follows: characteristic feelings too. For example, sadness is often accompanied by crying, and with it, characteristic feelings. (The tearful voice.) But these feelings are not the emotions. (In the sense that the number 2 is not the number 2.)

Among the emotions, one could distinguish between directed and undirected ones: fear of something, joy about something.

This something is the object, not the cause of the emotion.

489. The language game “I am afraid” already contains the object.

Anxiety could be called undirected fear insofar as its manifestations are similar or equal to those of fear.

The content of an emotion - by this we imagine something like a picture or something of which a picture can be made. (The darkness of depression descending upon one, the flame of anger.)

490. One might also call the human face such a picture, and represent the course of passion by its changes.

491. In contrast to sensations: they do not inform us about the external world. (Grammatical remark.)

Love and hate could be called emotional dispositions: also fear in a certain sense.

492. It is one thing to feel acute fear and another to fear someone 'chronically.' But fear is not a feeling.

'Terrible fear': are the sensations so terrible?

Typical causes of pain on the one hand, and depression, sadness, and joy on the other. The cause of these is also their object.

The behavior of pain and the behavior of sadness. – These can only be described by their external causes. (If the mother leaves the child alone, it may cry from grief; if it falls down, from pain.) Behavior and type of cause belong together.

493. There are fearful thoughts, hopeful ones, joyful ones, angry ones, etc.

494. Emotions express themselves in thoughts. One speaks angrily, fearfully, sadly, joyfully, etc., not with back pain.

A thought inspires emotional reactions (fear, sadness, etc.) in me, not physical pain.

495. I would almost like to say: One feels grief no more in the body than one feels sight in the eye.

496. (The terrible thing about fear is not the sensations of fear.) This thing is also reminiscent of hearing a noise from a certain direction . It is almost as if one felt the discomfort in the stomach region, the oppression of the breath, from the direction of the fear. In other words, "I feel sick with fear" does not indicate a cause of the fear.

497. "Where do you feel the sorrow?" - In the soul. - What conclusions do we draw from this indication of location? One is that we are not talking about a physical location of the sorrow. But we do point to our body as if the sorrow were in it. Is that because we feel a physical discomfort? I do not know the cause. But why should I assume that it is a physical discomfort?

498. Consider the following question: Can one imagine a pain, let us say of the quality of rheumatic pain, but without a location? Can one imagine it ?

When you begin to think about it, you will see how much you want to transform the knowledge of the location of the pain into a characteristic of what is felt , into a characteristic of a sensory datum, of the private object that stands before my soul.

499. If the fear is terrible, and if in it I am conscious of my breathing and of a tension in the muscles of my face, does that mean that these feelings are terrible to me? Could they not even be a relief? (Dostoyevsky.)

500. But why do we use the word "suffering" for fear and also for pain? Well, there are enough connections. –

501. To the statement "I cannot think of it without fear..." one might reply, for example, "There is no reason to be afraid, because..." This is at least a means of eliminating fear. The opposite of pain.

502. That there is a fear conglomerate of sensations, thoughts, etc. (e.g.) does not mean that fear is a conglomerate (syndrome).

503. If you pretend to be sad in your study, you will easily become aware of the tension in your face. But really grieve, or watch a sad action in a film, and ask yourself whether you were conscious of your face.

504. Love is not a feeling. Love is tested, pain is not. One does not say: "That was not real pain, otherwise it would not have gone away so quickly."

505. One connection between moods and sensory impressions is that we use mood concepts to describe sensory impressions and ideas. We say of a subject or a landscape that they are sad, happy, etc. But it is of course much more important that we describe the human face, action, and behavior using all mood concepts.

506. A friendly mouth, a friendly eye. How does one imagine a friendly hand? – Probably open and not as a fist. – And could one imagine the color of a person's hair as an expression of friendliness or the opposite? – But posed like this, the question seems to be whether we can succeed . The question should be: Do we want to call something a friendly or unfriendly hair color? If we wanted to give meaning to such words, we would imagine a person whose hair turns dark when he is angry. Reading the evil expression into the dark hair, however, would be done by means of an idea that was already formed earlier.

One can say that the friendly eye, the friendly mouth, the wagging of the dog's tail are, among others, primary and independent symbols of friendliness; I mean: they are parts of the phenomena that we call friendliness. If we want to think of other phenomena as expressions of friendliness, we see those symbols in them. We say "He is making a grim face"; perhaps because the eyes are more strongly shaded by the eyebrows; and now we transfer the idea of ​​darkness to the color of the hair.

507. Whoever asks whether pleasure is a sensation probably does not distinguish between reason and cause, for otherwise he would notice that one takes pleasure in something , which does not mean that this something causes a sensation in us.

508. But pleasure is certainly associated with a facial expression, and although we do not see it in ourselves, we can still feel it.

And try thinking about something very sad with an expression of radiant joy on your face!

509. It is possible that the glands of a sad person secrete differently from those of a happy person, and also that this secretion is the cause or a cause of sadness. But does it follow from this that sadness is a sensation caused by this secretion ?

510. But the thought here is: "You feel the grief after all –– so you must feel it somewhere ; otherwise it would be a chimera." But if you want to think like that, recall the difference between seeing and pain. I feel the pain in the wound –– but the color in the eye? The way we want to use a scheme here, instead of just noting what is really common, means that we see everything in a falsely simplified way.

511. But if one wanted to find an analogue to the place of pain, it would of course not be the soul (just as the place of physical pain is not the body), but the object of repentance.

512. Imagine if someone said that happiness was a feeling, and sadness consisted in not being happy. Is the absence of a feeling a feeling?

513. One speaks of a feeling of conviction because there is a tone of conviction. Indeed, the characteristic of all 'feelings' is that there is an expression, i.e. a look, a gesture of the feeling.

514. Now one could say: A person's face is not always the same shape. It changes from minute to minute; sometimes a little, sometimes to the point of being unrecognizable. Nevertheless, it is possible to draw a picture of his physiognomy. Of course, a picture in which the face is smiling does not show what it looks like when it is crying. But it does allow conclusions to be drawn. And in this way it would also be possible to describe a kind of approximate physiognomy of faith (for example).

515. I give signs of delight and understanding.

516. Can one call 'knowing one's way' an experience? No, but there are experiences characteristic of the state of knowing one's way and of not knowing one's way. (Not knowing one's way and lying.)

517. But it is important that there are all these paraphrases! That one can describe the worry with the words "Eternal gloom descends." Perhaps I have never emphasized enough the importance of this paraphrasing.

518. Why can the dog feel fear but not remorse? Would it be correct to say, "Because he cannot speak"?

519. Only those who can reflect on the past can repent. But that does not mean that only such a person is capable of experiencing the feeling of remorse.

520. There is nothing surprising in the fact that certain concepts should only be applicable to a being that, for example, possesses a language.

521. "The dog means something by wagging his tail." - How would one justify this? - Do we also say: "When the plant lets its leaves hang, it means that it needs water"? -

522. We would hardly ask whether the crocodile means something when it approaches a person with its jaws open. And we would explain that the crocodile cannot think, and therefore there is really no question of meaning here.

523. Let us forget for a moment that we are interested in the state of mind of the person who is afraid. It is certain that his behavior can also interest us under certain circumstances as an indication of future behavior. So why should we not have a word for it?

One might now ask whether this word really refers simply to behavior, simply to the change in the body. And we can answer that in the negative. We have no interest in simplifying the use of this word in this way. It refers to behavior under certain external circumstances. When we observe these circumstances and that behavior, we say that someone is ...., or has .....

524. There could be a concept of fear that only applies to animals, that is, only through observation. You don't mean to say that such a concept would have no use. The verb that would correspond incidentally to the word "to fear" would then have no first person, and none of its forms would be an expression of fear.

525. Now I will say that people who use such a concept should not be able to describe its use. And if they tried, it is possible that they would give a very inadequate description. (As most people would do if they tried to describe correctly the use of money.) (They are not prepared for such a task.)

526. If someone behaves in such and such a way under such and such circumstances, we say that he is sad. (This also applies to dogs.) In this respect, one cannot say that behavior is the cause of sadness; it is its sign. To call it the effect of sadness would also be inaccurate. If he says it about himself (that he is sad), he will not generally give his sad face or the like as the reason. But what about: "Experience has taught me that I become sad as soon as I begin to sit there sadly, etc."? That could mean two things. Firstly: "As soon as I, perhaps following a slight inclination, allow myself to hold myself and behave in such and such a way, I find myself in a situation where I have to continue in this behavior." It could be that toothache would be made worse by groaning. Secondly, however, that sentence could contain a speculation about the cause of human sadness; to the effect that anyone who was able to induce certain physical states in any way would make the person sad. But the difficulty here is that we would not call a person who looked and behaved sad under all circumstances sad. Indeed, if we taught such a person the expression "I am sad" and he said it constantly and incessantly with the expression of sadness, these words, like the other signs, would have lost their normal meaning.

527. Is it not as if one wanted to imagine a facial expression which was not capable of gradual, elusive changes, but had, say, only five positions; when one changed, one would suddenly pass into the other. Now would this fixed smile, for example, really be a smile? And why not? - We call a "smile" an expression in a normal facial expression. - I could perhaps not relate to it in the same way as to a smile. It would not, for example, make me smile myself. "No wonder," one would say, "that we have this concept under these circumstances."

528. An auxiliary construction. A tribe that we want to enslave. The government and science say that the people of this tribe have no souls, so they can be used for any purpose. Of course, we are still interested in their language, because we want to give them orders and receive reports from them, for example. We also want to know what they say to each other, because this is connected with their other behavior. But we must also be interested in what they say that corresponds to our 'psychological expressions', because we want to keep them able to work, so their expressions of pain, discomfort, depression, zest for life, etc., etc. are important to us. Yes, we have also found that these people can be used successfully as test subjects in physiological and psychological laboratories, because their reactions - including their language reactions - are exactly those of people with souls. It has also been discovered that these beings can be taught our language instead of theirs by a method very similar to our 'teaching'.

529. These beings learn to calculate, for example, in writing or orally. But we somehow get them to the point where they can tell us the result of a multiplication after they have behaved for a while in a 'thinking' attitude without writing or speaking. If one considers the way in which they learn this 'mental arithmetic' and the phenomena that surround it, the image suggests itself that the process of calculating has, as it were, submerged and is now taking place under the surface of the water.

Of course, for various purposes we need a command like "Do this in your head!"; a question like "Have you done it?"; even "How far have you got?"; a statement from the machine like "I did it..."; etc. In short, everything we say among ourselves about mental arithmetic is of interest to us when they say it. And what applies to mental arithmetic also applies to all other forms of thinking. If one of us expresses the opinion that these beings must have some kind of soul in which this or that takes place, we laugh at him.

530. The slaves also say: "When I heard the word 'bank', it meant to me...". Question: Against the background of what linguistic technique do they say this? Because that is what matters. What had we taught them, what use of the word "mean"? And what, if anything, do we take from their statement? Because if we cannot do anything with it, it could interest us as a curiosity. –– Let us imagine a tribe of people who do not know dreams and who hear our dream stories. One of us came to these non-dreaming people and gradually learned to communicate with them. – Perhaps one would think that they would never understand the word "dream". But they would soon find a use for it. And their doctors could very well be interested in the phenomenon and draw important conclusions from the stranger's dreams. –– Nor can one say that for these people the verb "dream" could mean nothing other than: to tell a dream. For the stranger would use both expressions: "to dream" and "to tell a dream", and the people of that tribe must not confuse "I dreamed..." with "I told the dream...".

531. "I assume that an image is before his eyes." - Could I also assume that an image is before this oven? - And why does this seem impossible? Is the human form then necessary for this? -

532. The concept of pain is characterized by its specific function in our lives.

533. Pain is part of our lives, has such connections. (That is: only what is part of our lives, has such connections, we call "pain".)

534. Only in the midst of certain normal expressions of life is there an expression of pain. Only in the midst of much more specific expressions of life is there an expression of grief or affection. Etc.

535. If I, or someone else, can imagine a pain, or if we say that we can, how can we find out whether we imagine it correctly, and how accurately?

536. I may know that he is in pain, but I never know the exact degree of his pain. So here is something that he knows and the expression of pain does not tell me. Something purely private.

He knows exactly how severe his pain is? (Isn't that similar to saying he always knows exactly where he is? Namely here.) Is the concept of degree given with the pain?

537. You say that you care for the groaner because experience has taught you that you yourself groan when you feel such and such. But since you do not draw such a conclusion, we can omit the argument by analogy.

538. Nor is it any use saying, "I do not care about my own groaning because I know that I am in pain" or "because I feel my pain ."

But it is true: – “I do not care about my groaning.”

539. I conclude from observing his behavior that he must see a doctor; but I do not draw this conclusion for myself from observing my own behavior. Or rather: I sometimes do this too, but not in analogous cases.

540. It helps here to consider that it is a primitive behavior to care for and treat the painful area of ​​another person and not only one's own - that is, to pay attention to the other person's pain behavior, as well as to ignore one's own pain behavior .

541. But what does the word "primitive" mean here? It certainly means that the mode of behavior is pre-linguistic : that a language game is based on it , that it is the prototype of a mode of thinking and not the result of thinking.

542. One can say that an explanation like this is "wrong-handed": We cared for the other person because, by analogy with our own case, we believed that he too had experienced pain. Instead of saying: Learn a new side from this particular chapter of human behavior - from this use of language.

543. My concept here includes my relationship to the phenomenon.

544. When we tell the doctor that we are in pain - in what cases is it useful for him to imagine a pain? - And does this not happen in very many different ways? (As many as remembering a pain.) (Knowing what a person looks like.)

545. Suppose someone explains how a child learns to use the word "pain" in this way: If the child behaves in such and such a way on certain occasions, I think that he feels what I feel in such cases; and if this is the case, the child associates the word with his feeling and uses the word when the feeling recurs. –– What does this explanation explain? Ask yourself: what kind of ignorance does it remedy? – Being certain that the other person is in pain, doubting whether he is in pain, etc., are so many natural, instinctive ways of relating to other people, and our language is only an aid and further development of this behavior. Our language-game is an extension of primitive behavior. (For our language-game is behavior.) (Instinct.)

546. "I am not sure whether he is in pain." - Now if someone were to prick himself with a needle every time he says this, in order to have the meaning of the word "pain" vividly before his mind (so as not to have to content himself with the idea) and to know what he is in doubt about in the other person! - Would the meaning of his statement now be certain?

547. So he has true pain, and the possession of this is what he doubts in others. – But how does he do it? –– It is as if someone had said to me: “Here is a chair. Do you see it clearly? – Good – now translate it into French!”

548. He therefore has the real pain, and now he knows what he should doubt about the other person. He has the object before him, and it is not 'behavior' or anything like that. (But now!) To doubt whether the other person is in pain, he needs the concept 'pain', not pains.

549. To call the expression of the feeling an assertion is misleading because the word "assertion" is associated with the 'testing', the 'justification', the 'confirmation', the 'refutation' of the assertion in the language game.

550. What is the purpose of the statement: “I have something when I am in pain”?

551. "The smell is wonderful!" Is there any doubt that it is the smell that is wonderful?

So it is a property of smell? - Why not? It is a property of ten to be divisible by two and also to be the number of my fingers.

But there could be a language in which people just close their eyes and say "Oh, that smell!" and there is no subject-predicate sentence that is equivalent to that. That is a 'specific' reaction.

552. One might say that the language game with the words "he is in pain" includes not only the image of behavior, but also the image of pain. But here one must be careful: think of my example of the private tables that are not part of the game . The impression of the "private table" in the game arises from the absence of a table and from the similarity of the game to one that is played with a table.

553. Consider: We often use the word "I do not know" in a strange way; for example, when we say that we do not know whether this person really feels more than the other person, or only expresses it more strongly. It is then not clear what kind of investigation could decide the question. Of course, the statement is not entirely idle: we want to say that we can compare the feelings of A and B, but circumstances lead us astray when comparing A with C.

554. We do not see that the evidence only makes the feeling (that is, the inner) of the other person probable, but that we regard this as evidence for something important, that we base a judgement on this complicated kind of evidence, that it therefore has a special importance in our life and is highlighted by a concept. (The inner and 'outer', an image .)

555. The ›uncertainty‹ does not refer to the particular case, but to the method, to the rules of evidence.

556. The reason for the uncertainty is not that he does not wear his pain on the outside of his coat. And there is no uncertainty in any particular case . If the border between two countries were disputed, would it follow that the nationality of each individual resident would be questionable?

557. Imagine that people could observe the functioning of the nervous system in others. They would then be able to distinguish between genuine and feigned feelings in a reliable manner. – Or could they doubt that the other person feels something when they see these signs? – In any case, one could easily imagine that what they see determines their behavior without any scruples.

And now we can transfer this to external behavior.

This observation completely determines their behavior towards the other person and no doubt arises.

558. There may well be cases where someone later reveals his innermost thoughts to me through a confession: but the fact that it is so cannot explain to me the nature of the outside and the inside, for I must nevertheless believe the confession.

The confession is also something external.

559. Look at people who doubt even under these circumstances; and those who do not doubt.

560. Only God sees the most secret thoughts. But why should they be so important? Some are important, not all. And must all people consider them important?

561. One kind of uncertainty would be the one we could bring to a mechanism unknown to us. The other would be to recall an event in our life. It could be, for example, that someone who has just escaped the fear of death would be afraid to kill a fly and would otherwise do it without hesitation. Or, on the other hand, that with this experience in mind he would hesitate to do something that he would otherwise do without hesitation.

562. Even if I ‘do not rest securely in my pity,’ I must not think of the uncertainty of his later conduct.

563. One insecurity comes, so to speak, from you, the other from him.

So one could say that one is connected with an analogy, but not the other. But not as if I were drawing a conclusion from the analogy!

564. But if I doubt whether a spider feels pain, it is not because I do not know what to expect.

565. But we cannot help but form a picture of the mental process. And not because we know it from ourselves!

566. Could not the behavior and behaviour of trust exist quite generally among a group of people, so that doubt about expressions of feeling is completely foreign to them?

567. How could one describe human behavior? But only insofar as one describes the actions of different people as they swarm together. Not what one person does now , a single action, but the whole swarm of human actions, the background against which we see every action, determines our judgment, our concepts and reactions.

568. If life were a carpet, this pattern (of dissimulation, for example) would not always be complete and would vary greatly. But we, in our conceptual world, see the same thing recurring again and again with variations. This is how our concepts understand it. Concepts are not for one-time use.

569. And one pattern is woven in the carpet with many other patterns.

570. " One cannot pretend like that." - And that can be an experience - namely, that no one who behaves in one way will later behave in such and such a way; but also a conceptual statement ("That would no longer be pretending"), and the two can be connected.

This can no longer be called “pretense.”

(For one would not have said that the planets must move in circles if it had not appeared that they moved in circles.)

(Compare: “You can’t talk like that without thinking,” “You can’t act like that without thinking.”)

571. "Couldn't you think of another environment in which this too could be interpreted as pretense?" Must not every behavior be capable of being interpreted in this way?

But what does it mean that all behavior could still be pretense ? Has experience taught us that? And how else can we be informed about pretense? No, it is a remark about the concept of pretense. But then this concept would be useless, because pretense would have no criteria in behavior.

572. Is there not something similar here to the relationship between Euclidean geometry and sensory experience? (I mean: there is a profound similarity.) For Euclidean geometry also corresponds to experience only in a way that is not at all easily understandable, and not just like the more exact to the less exact.

573. There is trust and distrust in behavior!

If someone complains, for example, I can react with complete certainty and trust, or uncertainly and like someone who has suspicions. No words or thoughts are needed.

574. Is that which he says he has, and of which I say I have, without our inferring this from any observation, the same as that which weinfer from observing the other person's behaviour and from his expression of conviction?

575. Can one say: I conclude that he will act as he intends to act?

(Case of the wrong gesture.)

576. Why do I never draw conclusions about my probable actions from my words? For the same reason that I do not draw conclusions about my probable behavior from my facial expression. For the interesting thing is not that I do not draw conclusions about my emotional state from my expression of emotion, but that I do not draw conclusions about my subsequent behavior from that expression, as others do who observe me.

577. Certain movements are voluntary in their normal environment of intention, learning, attempting, acting. Movements of which it makes sense to say that they are sometimes voluntary, sometimes involuntary, are movements in a special environment

578. Now if someone told us that he eats involuntarily, what evidence would make me believe this?

579. One causes oneself to sneeze or cough, but not to make a voluntary movement. And the will does not cause one to sneeze or walk.

580. My expression came from the fact that I thought of willing as a bringing about, but not as a causing, but rather - I would say - as a direct, non-causal bringing about. And underlying this idea is the notion that the causal nexus is the connection of two machine parts by a mechanism, for example a series of gears.

581. Is "I do my best" the expression of an experience? – One difference: One says "Do your best!"

582. If someone meets me on the street and asks me "Where are you going?" and I answer "I don't know," he assumes that I have no specific intention ; not that I don't know whether I will be able to carry out my intention. (Lebel.)

583. What is the difference between these two: Following a line involuntarily –– Following a line intentionally.

What is the difference between these two: Tracing a line carefully and with great attention –– Watching carefully as my hand follows a line.

584. Certain differences are easy to point out. One lies in the anticipation of what the hand will do.

585. Experience: getting to know a new experience. For example, when writing. When do you say you have had a new experience? How do you use a sentence like that?

586. Writing is certainly an arbitrary movement, and yet an automatic one. And of course there is no question of feeling every writing movement. One feels something, but it is impossible to analyze the feeling. The hand writes; it does not write because one wants it to, but because one wants what it writes.

You don't watch her writing with surprise or interest; you don't think, "What will she write now?" But not because you want her to write that. Because the fact that she writes what I want could really surprise me.

587. The child learns to walk, to crawl, to play. It does not learn to play voluntarily and involuntarily. But what makes the movements of play voluntary movements? - What would it be like if they were involuntary? - I could just as well ask: What makes this movement a game? - Its character and its environment.

588. Active and passive. Can one command it or not? This may seem a far-fetched distinction, but it is not. It is similar to: "Can one ( logical possibility) decide to do it or not?" - And that means: How is it surrounded by thoughts, feelings, etc.?

589. "When I exert myself, I am doing something, I am not just having a feeling." And so it is; for someone orders someone to "exert yourself," and he can express the intention, "I will exert myself now." And when he says, "I can't go on!", that does not mean, "I can no longer bear the feeling in my limbs - the pain, for example." On the other hand, one suffers from exertion as well as from pain. "I am completely exhausted" - someone who said that, but was moving as briskly as ever, would not be understood.

590. The connection between our main problem and the epistemological problem of volition has already struck me once before. When such a persistent problem arises in psychology, it is never a question of actual experience (such experience is always much more benign), but a logical, and therefore actually grammatical, problem.

591. My behavior is sometimes the object of my observation, but rarely . And this is connected with the fact that I intend my behavior. Even when the actor observes his own expression in the mirror, or the musician pays close attention to every note of his playing and judges it, he does so in order to direct his actions accordingly.

592. What does it mean, for example, that self-observation makes my actions and movements uncertain?

I cannot observe myself without being observed. And I do not observe myself for the same purpose as others.

593. If a child stamps its feet and cries in anger, who would say that it does this involuntarily? And why? Why do we assume that it does not do this involuntarily? What are the signs of voluntary action? Are there such signs? - What are the signs of involuntary movement? It does not follow orders like voluntary action. There is a "Come here!", "Go there!", "Make this arm movement!", but not "Make your heart beat faster!"

594. There is a certain combination of movements, words, expressions, such as expressions of unwillingness or willingness, which characterize the voluntary movements of the normal person. When you call the child, it does not come automatically: there is, for example, the gesture "I don't want to!" Or the joyful coming, the decision to come, the running away with the sign of fear, the effects of persuasion, all the reactions of play, the signs of reflection and its effects.

595. How could I prove to myself that I can move my arm at will? Perhaps by saying to myself, "I will move it now," and it moves? Or should I say, "Simply by moving it"? But how do I know that I have done it, and that it has not just moved by chance? Do I feel it after all? And what if my memory of earlier feelings deceives me, and so they were not the right decisive feelings at all?! (And which are the right ones?) And how does the other person know whether I have moved my arm at will? I will perhaps say to him, "Tell me what movement you want, and I will make it to convince you." - And what do you feel in your arm? "Well, the usual." There is nothing unusual about the feelings - the arm is not numb, for example (as if it had "fallen asleep").

596. A movement of my body, of which I do not know that it is taking place or has taken place, will be called involuntary. But what if I merely try to lift a weight, and no movement takes place? What if someone involuntarily made an effort to lift a weight? Under what circumstances would this behavior be called 'involuntary'?

597. Can not rest be as voluntary as movement? Can not the cessation of movement be voluntary? What better argument against a feeling of innervation?

598. What a strange concept 'try', 'endeavour' is; all the things one can 'endeavour to do'! (Remember, lift a weight, pay attention, think of nothing.) But then one could also say: What a strange concept 'do' is! What are the relationships between 'talking' and 'thinking', between 'talking' and 'talking to oneself'? (Compare the relationships between the types of numbers.)

599. One draws entirely different conclusions from involuntary movement than from voluntary movement: this characterises voluntary movement.

600. But how do I know that this movement was arbitrary? – I do not know, I express it.

601. "I'm pulling as hard as I can." How do I know? Does my muscle feeling tell me? The words are a signal; and they have a function .

But am I not experiencing anything? Am I not experiencing something? Something specific? A specific feeling of effort and of not being able to go on, of reaching the limit? Of course, but these expressions say no more than "I'm pulling as hard as I can."

602. Compare this case: Someone is asked to say what he feels when a weight rests on the palm of his hand. I can imagine that a conflict arises here: on the one hand he says to himself that what he feels is a pressure against the palm of his hand and a tension in the muscles of his arm; on the other hand he wants to say: "But that is not all; I feel a pull, a striving of the weight downwards!" - Does he then feel such a 'striving'? Yes: when he thinks of 'striving'. The word 'striving' here brings to mind a certain image, a gesture, a tone of voice; and in this you see the experience of striving.

(Remember, too: Some people say that such and such 'emanates a fluid'. That's where the word ' influence ' came from.)

603. The unpredictability of human behavior. If it did not exist, would one also say that one can never know what is going on in another person's mind?

604. But what if human behavior were not unpredictable? How should one imagine this? (That is: how to picture it, what connections to assume?)

605. One of the most philosophically dangerous ideas is, strangely enough, that we think with our heads or in our heads.

606. The idea of ​​thinking as a process in the head, in a completely enclosed space, gives it something occult.

607. Is thinking, so to speak, a specifically organic process of the soul - a kind of chewing and digestion in the soul? Can it then be replaced by an inorganic process that serves the same purpose, so to speak, by providing thinking with a prosthesis? How should one imagine a thinking prosthesis?

608. No assumption seems more natural to me than that there is no process in the brain associated with association or thought; indeed, it would be impossible to deduce thought processes from brain processes. I mean this: when I speak or write, I suppose a system of impulses associated with my spoken or written thought emanates from my brain. But why should the system continue in a central direction? Why should not this order, so to speak, arise from chaos? The case would be similar to that - that certain species of plants reproduced by seed, so that a seed always produces the same species of plant from which it was produced - but that nothing in the seed corresponds to the plant which it becomes; so that it is impossible to deduce from the properties or structure of the seed those of the plant which it becomes - that one can do this only from its history . Thus, from something quite amorphous, an organism could arise, so to speak, without cause; and there is no reason why this should not really be the case with our thoughts, that is, with our speech or writing, etc.

609. It is therefore quite possible that certain psychological phenomena cannot be investigated physiologically because there is no physiological correspondence to them.

610. I saw this man years ago; now I see him again, recognize him, remember his name. And why must there be a cause in my nervous system for this memory? Why must something, whatever,have been stored there in some form ? Why must he have left a trace? Why should there not be a psychological law that does not correspond to a physiological one? If this upsets our notions of causality, then it is time they were upset.

611. The prejudice in favour of psycho-physical parallelism is the fruit of primitive conceptions of our concepts. For if we admit causality between psychological phenomena which is not physiologically mediated, we think we are thereby admitting a nebulous nature of the soul.

612. Imagine this phenomenon: If I want someone to remember a text that I am reciting to him so that he can repeat it to me later, I have to give him a piece of paper and a pencil; and while I am speaking, he writes lines, symbols on the paper; if he is to reproduce the text later, he follows those lines with his eyes and recites the text. But I assume that his recording is not writing , that it is not connected to the words of the text by any rules; and yet he cannot reproduce the text without this recording; and if something is changed in it, if it is partially destroyed, he gets stuck when 'reading' or speaks the text uncertainly or unreliably or cannot find the words at all. - That is conceivable! - What I called the 'recording' would then not be a reproduction of the text, not a translation, so to speak, in a different symbolism. The text would not be recorded in the recording . And why should it be recorded in our nervous system?

613. Why should a law of nature not connect an initial and a final state of a system, but ignore the state between the two? (Just don't think about effects !)

614. "How is it that I see the tree upright even when I tilt my head to the side, and so the retinal image is that of a tree that is leaning?" So how is it that I refer to the tree as upright even under these circumstances? - "Well, I am aware of the tilt of my head, and so I make the necessary correction to the perception of my visual impressions." - But doesn't that mean confusing primary with secondary? Imagine if we knew nothing at all about the inner structure of the eye - would this problem even arise? In truth, we are not making any corrections here, this is just an explanation.

Yes – but now that the structure of the eye is known, how is it that we act like this, react like this? But does there have to be a physiological explanation here? What if we leave it at that? But you wouldn't speak like that if you were examining the behavior of a machine! – Well, who says that in this sense the living being, the animal body, is a machine? –

615. (I have never read any remark that if one closes one eye and "sees only with one eye," one does not see the darkness (blackness) at the same time as the closed eye.)

616. The limitlessness of visual space is clearest when we see nothing in total darkness.

617. What about the blind man; can a part of language not be explained to him? Or rather, cannot it be described ?

618. A blind man can say that he is blind and that the people around him are sighted. "Yes, but does he not mean something different by the words 'blind' and 'seeing' than the sighted person?" What is the basis for wanting to say something like that? Well, if someone did not know what a leopard looks like, he could still say and understand "This place is very dangerous, there are leopards there." But one would perhaps say that he does not know what a leopard is, and therefore does not know, or only partially knows, what the word "leopard" means, until one shows him such an animal. Now we have a similar situation with blind people. They do not know, so to speak, what it is like to see. - Is "not knowing fear" analogous to "never having seen a leopard"? Of course I would say no.

619. Could I not, for example, assume that he sees something red when I hit him on the head? This could correspond to an experience for sighted people.

If we accept this, he is still blind for practical life. That is, he does not react like a normal person. But if someone were blind in his eyes, but behaved in such a way that we would have to say that he sees with the palms of his hands (this behavior is easy to imagine), we would treat him as a sighted person, and we would also consider it possible to explain the word 'red' with the tablet.

620. You give someone a signal when you imagine something; you use different signals for different ideas. How do you agree on what each signal means?

621. Auditory ideas, visual ideas, how do they differ from sensations? Not by "vividness."

Ideas do not teach us about the external world, neither rightly nor wrongly. (Ideas are not hallucinations, nor are they imaginations.)

While I see an object, I cannot imagine it.

Difference in language games: "Look at the figure!" and "Imagine the figure!"

imagination subjected to the will.

Idea not image. I cannot determine what object I am imagining from the similarity of the image I am imagining to it.

The question “What do you imagine?” can be answered with an image.

622. One might say: The imagined sound is in a different space from the one heard. (Question: Why?) What is seen is in a different space from what is imagined.

Hearing is connected to listening; imagining a sound is not.

Therefore, the sound heard is in a different space than the one imagined.

623. I am reading a story and while I am reading, that is, while I am looking attentively and seeing clearly, I am imagining all sorts of things.

624. There may be people who never use the expression "see something in the mind's eye," or something similar; and yet they may be able to draw, model, imitate others, etc., "from the imagination," or from memory. Such a person may also close his eyes before drawing something from memory, or stare blindly in front of him. And yet he may deny that he then sees before him what he later draws. But how much should I put weight on this statement? Is it to judge whether he has a visual image? (Not only by it . Think of the expression: "Now I see it before me - now not any more." There is a real duration there.)

625. I could also have said earlier: The connection between imagining and seeing is close;but there is no similarity .

The language games that use these terms are fundamentally different, but related.

626. Difference: 'try to see something' and 'try to imagine something'. In the first case you say something like "Look closely!", in the second "Close your eyes!"

627. Because imagining is an act of the will, it does not inform us about the external world.

628. What is imagined is not in the same space as what is seen. Seeing is connected with looking.

629. "Seeing and imagining are different phenomena." - The words "seeing" and "imagining" have different meanings! Their meanings refer to a number of important types and manners of human behavior, to phenomena of human life.

630. Tell yourself again that if someone insists that what he calls a "visual representation" is similar to a visual impression, he may be mistaken! Or: What if he were mistaken about this? That is, what do you know about the similarity of his visual impression and his visual representation?! (I am talking about the other person because what applies to him also applies to me.)

What do you know, then, of this resemblance? It is only evident in the expressions he is inclined to use, not in what he says with those expressions.

631. "There is no doubt at all: the visual image and the visual impression are of the same kind!" You must know that from your own experience, and then it is something that may be true for you and not for others. (And of course that also applies to me when I say it.)

632. When we imagine something, we do not observe it. The fact that the images come and go does not happen to us. We are not surprised by these images and say "Look there!" (The opposite of, for example, afterimages.)

633. We do not 'drive away' visual impressions, but ideas. And we do not say of the former that we cannot drive them away.

634. If someone really said, "I don't know whether I see a tree or whether I imagine one," I would at first think that he meant, "or am I just imagining that there is one there." If he did not mean that, I would not be able to understand him at all - but if someone wanted to explain this case to me and said, "He has such extraordinarily vivid ideas that he can take them for sense impressions," would I understand it now?

635. But must one distinguish here: (a) imagining the face of a friend, for example, but not in the room that surrounds me – (b) imagining a picture on this wall there?

If you were asked to “Imagine a round spot over there,” you might imagine that you really see one there.

636. The ›idea‹ does not enter the language game where one would expect it to.

637. I learn the concept of 'seeing' by describing what I see. I learn to observe and to describe what I have observed. I learn the concept of 'imagining' in a different connection. The descriptions of what is seen and what is imagined are of the same kind, and a description could be either one or the other; but otherwise the concepts are quite different. The concept of imagining is more like that of doing than of receiving. Imagining could be called a creative act. (And it is called that.)

638. "Yes, but the idea itself, like the visual impression, is the inner image, and you are only talking about the differences in the production, creation, and treatment of the image." The idea is not an image, nor is the visual impression one. Neither 'idea' nor 'impression' is an image concept, although in both cases there is a connection with an image, and each time a different one.

639. What do you call the »experiential content« of seeing, what »experiential content« of the imagination?

640. "But could I not imagine an experience content of the kind of visual representation, but not subject to the will, in this respect like the visual impression?"

641. (It is clear that the voluntary act of imagining cannot be compared with the movement of a body; for others are also able to judge whether the movement has taken place; whereas in the case of the movement of my ideas, it would only be a question of what I claim to see, whatever someone else sees. The actual objects in motion would therefore be excluded from consideration, since they would not be important at all.)

642. If one were to say: "Ideas are inner images, similar or exactly like my visual impressions, only subject to my will" – this would not yet make any sense.

For if someone has learned to report what he sees there, or what seems to him to be there , it is still not clear what the command means that he should now see that there, or that it should now appear to him to be that there.

643. What does it mean to "move by the will alone"? Does it mean that the images in my mind always follow my will exactly, while my drawing hand, my pencil, does not? After all, it would then be possible to say: "I usually imagine exactly what I want; today it turned out differently." Is there such a thing as a "failure of imagination"?

644. A language game involves the use of several words.

645. Nothing could be more false than to say that seeing and imagining are different activities. That is like saying that moving and losing in chess are different activities.

646. When we as children learn to use the words "see," "look," and "imagine," volitional actions and commands play a role in this training. But a different one for each of the three words. The language game "Look" and "Imagine!" - How can I compare them? - If we want to train someone to react to the command "Look!" and to understand the command "Imagine!", we must obviously teach him something completely different. Reactions that belong to this language game do not belong to that one. Yes, there is of course a close connection between the language games, but a similarity? - Parts of one are similar to parts of the other, but the similar parts are not homologous.

647. I could imagine something similar for real games.

648. A language game analogous to one part of another. A space projected into limited pieces of a space. A 'holey' space. (On 'Inside and Outside'.)

649. Let us imagine a variant of the game of tennis: the rules of this game include the fact that the player has to imagine this and that when performing certain actions ! (The purpose of this rule is to make the game more difficult.) The first objection is that it is too easy to cheat in this game. But this is countered by the assumption that the game is only played by honest and reliable people. So here we have a game with internal actions. –

Now what kind of inner game action is it, what does it consist of? In the fact that he - in accordance with the rules of the game - imagines ..... - But could one not also say: we do not know what kind of inner game action is that he carries out in accordance with the rules; we only know its expressions? The inner game action is an X whose nature we do not know. Or: here too there are only external game actions: the communication of the rules of the game and what is called the 'expression of the inner process'. - Well, can one not describe the game in all three ways? The 'unknown' X is also a perfectly possible way of describing it. One says that the so-called 'inner' game action is not comparable to a game action in the usual sense - another says that it is comparable to one - a third says that it is comparable only to an action that takes place in secret and that no one knows about except the actor.

It is important for us to see the dangers of the expression "inner play action". It is dangerous because it causes confusion.

650. Memory: "I can still see us sitting at that table." - But do I really have the same visual image - or one of those that I had then? Am I also sure that I see the table and my friend from the same point of view as I did then, and not myself? - My memory image is not evidence of that past situation; as would be a photograph that, taken then, now proves to me that it was like that then. The memory image and the memory words are on the same level.

651. We call shrugging our shoulders, shaking our heads, nodding, etc. signs primarily because theyare embedded in the use of our verbal language .

652. If we take it for granted that man enjoys his imagination, we should remember that imagination is not a painted picture, a sculpture or a film, but a complex structure made up of heterogeneous components - signs and images.

653. Some people remember a musical theme by seeing the score before them and reading it out.

It is conceivable that what we call "remembering" in a person would consist in him seeing himself looking up a book in his mind, and that what he reads in this book is precisely what he remembers. (How do I react to a memory?)

654. Can one describe a memory experience? – Certainly. – But can one describe the memorable aspect of this experience? What does that mean? (The indescribable aroma.)

655. "An image (idea, memory) of longing." One thinks that one has already done everything by speaking of an 'image'; for longing is precisely a content of consciousness, and its image is something that is (very) similar to it, even if less distinct than the original.

And one could certainly say of someone who plays longing in the theater that he experiences or has an image of longing: namely, not as an explanation of his actions, but as a description of them.

656. Being ashamed of a thought. Are you ashamed of having said such and such a sentence to yourself in your imagination?

Language has multiple roots; it has roots, not one root. [ Marginal note: ((Remembering a thought, an intention.)) Germ. ]

657. "It tastes exactly like sugar." How is it that I can be so sure of that? - Even if it turns out to be wrong. And what surprises me about that? That I bring the concept of sugar into such a strong connection with the sensation of taste. That I seem to recognize the substance sugar directly in the taste.

But instead of saying "It tastes exactly like ...," I could more simply say "Sugar!" And can one say that when one hears the word "the substance sugar comes to mind"? How does one do that?

658. Can I say that this taste imperatively brings with it the name "sugar" or the image of a piece of sugar? Neither seems correct. Yes, the desire for the concept "sugar" is certainly imperative, just as it is for the concept "red" when we use it to describe what we see.

659. I remember that sugar tasted like that. The experience comes back to my consciousness. But of course: how do I know that it is the earlier experience? My memory is no longer of any help to me. No, these words - the experience comes back .... - are only a paraphrase, not a description of the memory.

But when I say "It tastes just like sugar," there is an important sense in which no remembering takes place. I am therefore not justifying my judgment or my exclamation . If someone asks me, "What do you mean by 'sugar'?" - I will certainly try to show them a piece of sugar. And if someone asks, "How do you know that sugar tastes like that?" I will certainly answer, "I have eaten sugar thousands of times" - but that is not a justification that I give myself.

660. "It tastes like sugar." One remembers exactly and with certainty what sugar tastes like. I do not say, "I think that is what sugar tastes like." What a strange phenomenon! The phenomenon of memory. - But is it right to call it a strange phenomenon?

It is nothing less than strange. That certainty is not (by a hair) stranger than uncertainty would be. What is strange then? That I say with certainty "That tastes like sugar"? Or that it really is sugar? Or that others think the same thing?

If the certain recognition of sugar is strange, then the failure to recognize it would be less so.

661. "What a strange and terrible sound. I shall never forget it." And why should one not be able to say the same of remembering ("What a strange ... experience ...") when one has seen into the past for the first time? -

662. Remembering: seeing into the past. Dreaming could be called that if it shows us the past. But not remembering; for even if it shows us scenes with hallucinatory clarity, it only now teaches us that this is the past.

663. But if memory shows us the past, how does it show us that it is the past?

It simply does not show us the past. Just as our senses do not show us the present.

664. Nor can it be said that it tells us the past. For even if memory were an audible voice speaking to us, how could we understand it? If it tells us, for example, "Yesterday the weather was fine," how can I learn what "yesterday" means?

665. I only demonstrate to myself what I demonstrate to others.

666. I can demonstrate my good memory to others, and also to myself. I can question myself. (Vocabulary, data.)

667. But how do I demonstrate remembering to myself? Well, I ask myself "How did I spend this morning?" and answer it. - But what did I actually demonstrate to myself? Was it remembering? Namely, what it is like to remember something? - Would I havedemonstrated remembering to someone else ?

668. Forgetting the meaning of a word - remembering it again. What kind of process is involved? What do you remember, what comes to mind when you remember what the English word "perhaps" means.

669. If I am asked, "Do you know the ABC?" and I answer "yes," I am not saying that I am now going over the ABC in my mind, or that I am in a special state of mind which is in any way equivalent to reciting the ABC.

670. One can own a mirror, but does one then also own the reflection that appears in it?

671. To say something is an activity, to be inclined to say something is a state . "But why does it exist?" - Consider how the expression is used!

672. "As long as the temperature of the rod does not fall below ....., it can be forged." So it makes sense to say: "I can forge it from 5 to 6 o'clock." Or: "I can play chess from 5 to 6," that is, I have time from 5 to 6. - "As long as my pulse does not fall below ...., I can do the calculation." This calculation takes 1½ minutes; but how long does it take to be able to do it? And if you can do the calculation for an hour, do you always start from scratch?

673. Attention is dynamic, not static – one might say. I compare paying attention to staring first: but that is not what I call attention; and now I want to say that I think one cannot pay attention statically.

674. If I say in a particular case: attention consists in the readiness to follow every smallest movement that may appear, then you already see that attention is not the fixed gaze, but a concept of a different kind.

675. States: 'Being able to climb a mountain' can be called a state of my body. I say: "I can climb up - I mean: I am strong enough to do so." Compare this with this state of being able: "Yes, I can go there - I mean: I have time to do so."

676. What role do false sentences play in a language game? I think there are several cases.

(1) One person has to observe the signal lights at a crossroads and tell another person what color they show. He makes a mistake and says the wrong color.

(2) Meteorological observations are made and the weather for the next day is predicted according to certain rules. The prediction either comes true or it does not.

In the first case, you can say he is playing foul; in the second case, not – as I believed at the time.

One is plagued here by a question that goes something like this: Is verification still part of the language game?

677. I assert: "If this happens, that will happen . If I am right, you pay me a shilling; if I am wrong, I pay you one; if it remains a tie, nobody pays." This could also be expressed as follows: the case in which the premise does not happen does not interest us; we do not talk about it. Or: it is not natural for us here to use the words "yes" and "no" as in the case (and there are such cases) in which we are interested in the material implication. By "no" we mean here "p and not q," by "yes" only "p and q." There is no theorem of the excluded middle which goes like this : you either win the bet or lose it—there is no middle.

678. Someone throws a 5 in a game of dice, then a 4, and says, "If only I had thrown a 4 instead of his, I would have won!" The conditionality is not physical but only mathematical, because one could answer, "If you had thrown a 4 first, who knows what you would have thrown afterwards!"

679. If you now say, "The use of the subjunctive is based on belief in a law of nature," one can reply, "It is not based on this belief; it and this belief are on the same level." (I heard a father in a film say to his daughter that he should have married someone else: " She should have been your mother"! Why is that incorrect?)

680. Fate is the opposite of natural law. We want to understand and use natural law, but not fate.

681. "If p happens, then q happens" could be called a conditional prediction. That is: I make no prediction for the case not-p. But for that reason what I say is not made true by "not- and not-q".

Or like this : there are conditional predictions, and »p implies q« is not one of them.

682. I will call the sentence "If p occurs, then q occurs" "S". - "S or not-S" is a tautology: but is it (also) the law of the excluded middle? Or also like this: If I want to say that the prediction "S" can be right, wrong or undecided, is this expressed by the sentence "not (S or not-S)"?

683. Is the negation of a sentence identical with the disjunction of the non-excluded cases? In some cases it is. (E.g. in this one: "The permutation of the elements ABC that he wrote down was not AC B.")

684. Der wichtige Sinn des Fregeschen Behauptungszeichens wird vielleicht am besten dadurch gefaßt, daß wir sagen: es bezeichnet deutlich den Anfang des Satzes. – Das ist wichtig: denn unsere philosophischen Schwierigkeiten, das Wesen der ›Negation‹ und des ›Denkens‹ betreffend, hängen damit zusammen, daß ein Satz »
 nicht p«, oder »
 ich glaube p« wohl den Satz »p« enthält, aber nicht »
p«. (Denn wenn ich jemanden sagen höre: »es regnet«, so weiß ich nicht, was er gesagt hat, wenn ich nicht weiß, ob ich den Anfang des Satzes gehört habe.)

685. Ein Widerspruch verhindert mich, im Sprachspiel zur Tat zu kommen.

686. Nehmen wir aber an, das Sprachspiel bestünde eben darin, mich fortwährend von einem Entschluß in den entgegengesetzten zu werfen!

687. Der Widerspruch ist nicht als Katastrophe aufzufassen, sondern als eine Mauer, die uns anzeigt, daß wir hier nicht weiter können.

688. Ich möchte nicht so sehr fragen »Was müssen wir tun, um einen Widerspruch zu vermeiden?«, als »Was sollen wir tun, wenn wir zu einem Widerspruch gelangt sind?«

689. Warum ist ein Widerspruch mehr zu fürchten als eine Tautologie?

690. Unser Motto könnte sein: »Lassen wir uns nicht behexen!«

691. »Der Kretische Lügner«. Statt zu sagen »ich lüge«, könnte er auch hinschreiben »dieser Satz ist falsch«. Die Antwort darauf wäre: »Wohl, aber welchen Satz meinst du?« – »Nun, diesen Satz.« – »Ich verstehe, aber von welchem Satz ist in ihm die Rede?« – »Von diesem.« – »Gut, und auf welchen Satz spielt dieser an?« u.s.w. Er könnte uns so nicht erklären, was er meint, ehe er zu einem kompletten Satz übergeht. – Man kann auch sagen: Der fundamentale Fehler liegt darin, daß man denkt, ein Wort, z. B. »dieser Satz«, könne auf seinen Gegenstand gleichsam anspielen (aus der Entfernung hindeuten), ohne ihn vertreten zu müssen.

692. Stellen wir uns die Frage: Welchem praktischen Zweck kann Russell's Theorie der Typen dienen? – R. macht uns darauf aufmerksam, daß wir manchmal den Ausdruck der Allgemeinheit einschränken müssen um zu vermeiden, daß unerwünschte Konsequenzen aus ihm gezogen werden.

693. Das Raisonnement, das zu einem endlosen Regreß führt, ist nicht darum aufzugeben, ›weil wir so nie das Ziel erreichen können‹, sondern, weil es hier ein Ziel nicht gibt; so daß es gar keinen Sinn hat zu sagen »wir können es nicht erreichen«.

Wir meinen leicht, wir müßten den Regreß ein paar Stufen weit durchlaufen und ihn dann sozusagen in Verzweiflung aufgeben. Während seine Ziellosigkeit (das Fehlen des Zieles im Kalkül) aus der Anfangsposition zu entnehmen ist.

694. Eine Variante des Cantor'schen Diagonalbeweises: N = F(k, n) sei die Form der Gesetze für die Entwicklung von Dezimalbrüchen. N ist die n-te Dezimalstelle der k-ten Entwicklung. Das Gesetz der Diagonale ist dann: N = F (n, n) = Def. F'(n).

Zu beweisen ist, daß F'(n) nicht eine der Regeln F (k, n) sein kann. Angenommen, es sei die 100ste. Dann lautet die Regel zur Bildung

von F'(1)	F(1,1)
von F'(2)	F(2,2) etc.
aber die Regel zur Bildung der 100sten Stelle von F'(n) wird F(100,100); d. h., sie sagt uns nur, daß die 100ste Stelle sich selber gleich sein soll, ist also für n = 100 keine Regel.

Die Spielregel lautet »Tu das Gleiche, wie ....!« – und im besondern Fall wird sie nun »Tu das Gleiche, wie das, was du tust!«

695. Das Verstehen der mathematischen Frage. Wie wissen wir, ob wir eine mathematische Frage verstehen?

Eine Frage – kann man sagen – ist ein Auftrag. Und einen Auftrag verstehen, heißt: wissen, was man zu tun hat. Ein Auftrag kann natürlich ganz vag sein – z. B., wenn ich sage: »Bring ihm etwas, was ihm gut tut!« Aber dies kann heißen: denk an ihn, seinen Zustand etc. in freundlicher Weise und dann bring ihm etwas, was deiner Gesinnung gegen ihn entspricht.

696. Die mathematische Frage ist eine Herausforderung. Und man könnte sagen: sie hat Sinn, wenn sie uns zu einer mathematischen Tätigkeit anspornt.

697. Man könnte dann auch sagen, eine Frage in der Mathematik habe Sinn, wenn sie die mathematische Phantasie anregt.

698. Übersetzen von einer Sprache in die andere, ist eine mathematische Aufgabe, und das Übersetzen eines lyrischen Gedichts z. B. in eine fremde Sprache ist ganz analog einem mathematischen Problem. Denn man kann wohl das Problem stellen »Wie ist dieser Witz (z. B.) durch einen Witz in der andern Sprache zu übersetzen?«, d. h. zu ersetzen; und das Problem kann auch gelöst sein; aber eine Methode, ein System zu seiner Lösung gab es nicht.

699. Denk die Menschen, die mit ›äußerst komplizierten‹ Zahlzeichen rechnen. Diese stellen sich aber dar als Figuren, welche entstehen, wenn man unsere Zahlzeichen aufeinander schreibt.

Sie schreiben z. B. π bis zur fünften Stelle so: note 699.png Wer ihnen zusähe, fände es schwer zu erraten, was sie tun. Und sie könnten es vielleicht selbst nicht erklären. Es kann ja dieses Zahlzeichen, in etwas anderer Schrift geschrieben, seine Erscheinung (für uns) zur Unkenntlichkeit ändern. Und was die Leute täten, erschiene uns rein intuitiv.

700. Warum zählen wir? Hat es sich als praktisch erwiesen? Haben wir unsere Begriffe, z. B. die psychologischen, weil es sich als vorteilhaft erwiesen hat? – Und doch haben wir gewisse Begriffe eben deswegen, haben sie deswegen eingeführt.

701. Übrigens tritt der Unterschied zwischen dem, was man Sätze der Mathematik nennt und Erfahrungssätzen zu Tage, wenn man bedenkt, ob es Sinn hat zu sagen: »ich wünschte, 2 × 2 wäre 5!«

702. Wenn man bedenkt, daß die Gleichung 2 + 2 = 4 ein Beweis des Satzes ist »es gibt gerade Zahlen«, so sieht man, wie lose hier das Wort »Beweis« gebraucht ist. Aus der Gleichung 2 + 2 = 4 soll der Satz »es gibt gerade Zahlen« hervorgehen?! – Und was ist der Beweis der Existenz von Primzahlen? – Die Methode der Zerlegung in Primfaktoren. Aber in dieser Methode wird ja überhaupt nicht geredet, auch nicht von ›Primzahlen‹.

703. »Die Kinder müßten, um das Rechnen der Volksschule zu verstehen, bedeutende Philosophen sein; in Ermanglung dessen brauchen sie die Übung.«

704. Russell und Frege fassen den Begriff gleichsam als Eigenschaft eines Dings auf. Aber es ist sehr unnatürlich, die Worte »Mensch«, »Baum«, »Abhandlung«, »Kreis« als Eigenschaften eines Substrats aufzufassen.

705. Die Dirichlet'sche Auffassung der Funktion ist nur dort möglich, wo sie nicht ein unendliches Gesetz durch eine Liste ausdrücken will, denn eine unendliche Liste gibt es nicht.

706. Die Zahlen sind der Mathematik nicht fundamental.

707. Der Begriff des ›Ordnens‹ der Rationalzahlen z. B. und der ›Unmöglichkeit‹, die Irrationalzahlen so zu ordnen. Vergleiche das mit dem, was man ›Ordnen‹ von Ziffern nennt. Gleichermaßen der Unterschied zwischen dem ›Zuordnen‹ einer Ziffer (oder Nuß) zu einer andern und dem ›Zuordnen‹ aller ganzen Zahlen zu den geraden Zahlen; etc. Überall Begriffsverschiebungen.

708. Es gibt offenbar eine Methode, ein gerades Lineal anzufertigen. Diese Methode schließt ein Ideal ein, ich meine, ein Näherungsverfahren mit unbegrenzter Möglichkeit, denn eben dieses Verfahren ist das Ideal.

Oder vielmehr: Nur, wenn es ein Näherungsverfahren mit unbegrenzter Möglichkeit ist, kann (nicht muß) die Geometrie dieses Verfahrens die euklidische sein.

709. Die Rechnung als Ornament zu betrachten, das ist auch Formalismus, aber einer guten Art.

710. Man kann die Rechnung als Ornament betrachten. Eine Figur in der Ebene kann an eine andere passen oder nicht, mit anderen in verschiedener Weise zusammengefaßt werden. Wenn die Figur noch gefärbt ist, so gibt es dann noch ein Passen. (Die Farbe ist nur eine weitere Dimension.)

711. Es gibt eine Betrachtungsweise der elektrischen Maschinen und Apparate (Dynamos, Radiostationen, etc., etc.), die sozusagen ohne vorgefaßtes Verständnis diese Gegenstände als eine Verteilung von Kupfer, Eisen, Gummi, etc. im Raum ansieht. Und diese Betrachtungsweise könnte zu manchem interessanten Resultat führen. Sie ist ganz analog der eines mathematischen Satzes als Ornament. – Es ist natürlich eine durchaus strenge und korrekte Auffassung; und das Charakteristische und Schwierige an ihr ist, daß sie den Gegenstand ohne jede vorgefaßte Idee betrachtet (sozusagen von einem Marsstandpunkt), oder vielleicht richtiger: die normale vorgefaßte Idee zerstört (durchkreuzt).

712. (Der Stil meiner Sätze ist außerordentlich stark von Frege beeinflußt. Und wenn ich wollte, so könnte ich wohl diesen Einfluß feststellen, wo ihn auf den ersten Blick keiner sähe.)

713. »Leg es hier hin« – wobei ich mit dem Finger den Platz bezeichne – dies ist eine absolute Ortsangabe. Und wer sagt, der Raum sei absolut, möchte als Argument dafür vorbringen: »Es gibt doch einen Ort: Hier.« [Randbemerkung: ((Vielleicht zu den ersten Sprachspielen.))]

714. Man könnte sich eine Geisteskrankheit denken, in welcher Einer Namen nur in Anwesenheit ihrer Träger gebrauchen und verstehen kann.

715. Es könnte von Zeichen ein Gebrauch gemacht werden solcher Art, daß die Zeichen nutzlos würden (daß man sie viel leicht vernichtete), sobald der Träger aufhörte zu existieren.

In diesem Sprachspiel hat sozusagen der Name den Gegenstand an einer Schnur; und hört der Gegenstand auf zu existieren, so kann man den Namen, der mit ihm zusammen gearbeitet hat, wegwerfen. (Das Wort »handle« für den Eigennamen.)

716. Wie ist es mit den beiden Sätzen: »dieses Blatt ist rot« und »dieses Blatt hat die Farbe, die auf Deutsch ›rot‹ heißt«? Sagen beide dasselbe?

Hängt das nicht davon ab, was das Kriterium dafür ist, daß eine Farbe auf Deutsch ›rot‹ heißt?

717. »Gott kannst du nicht mit einem Andern reden hören, sondern nur, wenn du der Angeredete bist.« – Das ist eine grammatische Bemerkung.
