EREADER VERION’S NOTE 


As far as Iam aware, this is the only proper ebook version of Philosophical 
Investigations available anywhere on the internet, through legal means or 
otherwise. It is based on the plain text archive.org pulled from this original 
PDF using OCR, plus extensive cleanup, since the raw OCR’d text files 
archive.org provides for PDFs are typically in seriously rough shape, and this 
book was no exception. I spent a good three or four hours making extensive 
use of Python scripts, the ‘sed’ and ‘ispell’ shell programs, regular 
expressions, and a whole lot of manual elbow grease in VIM, as well as going 
page-by-page through the original PDF to make sure I hadn’t messed things 
up and to double-check that my edits hadn’t changed the original meaning of 
anything, but Iam reasonably confident that, while not perfect, this version 
is now at least acceptable. Enjoy! 


Anarchy is order, 
Property is theft, 


Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must remain silent. 


TRANSLATOR’S NOTE 


By acknowledgments are due to the following, who either checked the 
translation or allowed me to consult them about German and Austrian usage 
or read the translation through and helped me to improve the English: Mr. R. 
Rhees, Professor G. H. von Wright, Mr. P. Geach, Mr. G. Kreisel, Miss L. 
Labowsky, Mr. D. Paul, Miss I. Murdoch. 


NOTE ON SECOND EDITION 


The text has been revised for the new edition. A large number of small 
changes have been made in the English text. The following passages have 
been significantly altered: 


In Part I: §§ 108, 109, 116, 189, 193, 251, 284, 352, 360, 393,418, 426, 442, 
456, 493, 520, 356, 582, 591, 644, 690, 692. 


In Part II: pp. 193c, 2iie, 2i6e, 217c, 220e, 232c. The text of the Third 
Edition remains unaltered, but an index has been added 


EDITORS’ NOTE 


That appears as Part I of this volume was complete by 1945. Part Of was 
written between 1946 and 1949. Of Wittgenstein had published his work 
himself, he would have suppressed a good deal of what is in the last thirty 
pages or so of Part I and worked what is in Part II, with further material, into 
its place. 


We have had to decide between variant readings for words and phrases 
throughout the manuscript. The choice never affected the sense. 


The passages printed beneath a line at the foot of some pages are written on 
slips which Wittgenstein had cut from other writings and inserted at these 
pages, without any further indication of where they were to come in. 


Words standing between double brackets are Wittgenstein’s references to 
remarks either in this work or in other writings of his which we hope will 
appear later. 


We are responsible for placing the final fragment of Part Of in its present 
position.

PREFACE 


The thoughts which I publish in what follows are the precipitate of 
philosophical investigations which have occupied me for the last sixteen 
years. They concern many subjects: the concepts of meaning, of 
understanding, of a proposition, of logic, the foundations of mathematics, 
states of consciousness, and other things. I have written down all these 
thoughts as remarks , short paragraphs, of which there is sometimes a fairly 
long chain about the same subject, while I some times make a sudden 
change, jumping from one topic to another.—It was my intention at first to 
bring all this together in a book whose form I pictured differently at different 
times. But the essential thing was that the thoughts should proceed from one 
subject to another in a natural order and without breaks. 


After several unsuccessful attempts to weld my results together into such a 
whole, I realized that I should never succeed. The best that I could write 
would never be more than philosophical remarks; my thoughts were soon 
crippled if I tried to force them on in any single direction against their 
natural inclination.-And this was, of course, connected with the very nature 
of the investigation. For this compels us to travel over a wide field of thought 
criss-cross in every direction.— The philosophical remarks in this book are, 
as it were, a number of sketches of landscapes which were made in the 
course of these long and involved journeyings. 


The same or almost the same points were always being approached afresh 
from different directions, and new sketches made. Very many of these were 
badly drawn or uncharacteristic, marked by all the defects of a weak 
draughtsman. And when they were rejected a number of tolerable ones were 
left, which now had to be arranged and sometimes cut down, so that if you 
looked at them you could get a picture of the landscape. Thus this book is 
really only an album. 


Up to a short time ago I had really given up the idea of publishing my work 
in my lifetime. It used, indeed, to be revived from time to time: mainly 
because I was obliged to learn that my results (which I had communicated in 
lectures, typescripts and discussions), variously misunderstood, more or less 
mangled or watered down, were in circulation. This stung my vanity and I 
had difficulty in quieting it. 


Four* years ago I had occasion to re-read my first book (the Tractates Logico- 
Pbilosophicus ) and to explain its ideas to someone. It suddenly seemed to me 
that I should publish those old thoughts and the new ones together: that the 
latter could be seen in the right light only by contrast with and against the 
background of my old way of thinking. 1 


For since beginning to occupy myself with philosophy again, sixteen years 
ago, I have been forced to recognize grave mistakes in what I wrote in that 
first book. I was helped to realize these mistakes—to a degree which I myself 
am hardly able to estimate—by the criticism which my ideas encountered 
from Frank Ramsey, with whom I discussed them in innumerable 
conversations during the last two years of his life. Even more than to this— 
always certain and forcible— criticism I am indebted to that which a teacher 
of this university, Mr. P. Sraffa, for - many years unceasingly practised on my 
thoughts. 


I am indebted to this stimulus for the most consequential ideas of this book. 


For more than one reason what I publish here will have points of contact 
with what other people are writing to-day.—If my remarks do not bear a 
stamp which marks them as mine,—I do not wish to lay any further claim to 
them as my property. 


I make them public with doubtful feelings. It is not impossible that it should 
fall to the lot of this work, in its poverty and in the darkness of this time, to 
bring light into one brain or another—but, of course, it is not likely. 


I should not like my writing to spare other people the trouble of thinking . 
But, if possible, to stimulate someone to thoughts of his own. 


I should have liked to produce a good book. This has not come about, but the 
time is past in which I could improve it. 


Cambridge, 


January 1945. 


PART I 


1 


“When they (my elders) named some object, and accordingly moved towards 
something, I saw this and I grasped that the thing was called by the sound 
they uttered when they meant to point it out. Their intention was shewn by 
their bodily movements, as it were the natural language of all peoples: the 
expression of the face, the play of the eyes, the movement of other parts of 
the body, and the tone of voice which expresses our state of mind in seeking, 
having, rejecting, or avoiding something. Thus, as I heard words repeatedly 
used in their proper places in various sentences, I gradually learnt to 
understand what objects they signified; and after I had trained my mouth to 
form these signs, I used them to express my own desires.” 


Augustine does not speak of there being any difference between kinds of 
word. Of you describe the learning of language in this way you are, I believe, 
thinking primarily of nouns like “table”, “chair”, “bread”, and of people’s 
names, and only secondarily of the names of certain actions and properties; 
and of the remaining kinds of word as something that will take care of itself. 


How think of the following use of language: I send someone shop- ping. I 
give him a slip marked “five red apples”. We takes the slip to the shopkeeper, 
who opens the drawer marked “apples”; then he looks up the word “red” in a 
table and finds a colour sample opposite it; then he says the series of cardinal 
numbers—I assume that he knows them by heart—up to the word “five” and 
for each number he takes an apple of the same colour as the sample out of 
the drawer.-It is in this and similar ways that one operates with words.-“But 
how does he know where and how he is to look up the word ‘red* and what 
he is to do with the word ’five’?”—Well, I assume that he acts as I have 
described. Explanations come to an end somewhere.—But what is the 
meaning of the word “five”?—No such thing was in question here, only how 
the word “five” is used. 


2 


That philosophical concept of meaning has its place in a primitive idea of the 
way language functions. But one can also say that it is the idea of a language 
more primitive than ours. 


Let us imagine a language for which the description given by Augustine is 
right. The language is meant to serve for communication between a builder A 
and an assistant B. A is building with building- stones: there are blocks, 
pillars, slabs and beams. A has to pass the stones, and that in the order in 


which A needs them. For this purpose they use a language consisting of the 
words “block”, “pillar”, “slab”, “beam”. A calls them out;—B brings the stone 
which he has learnt to bring at such-and-such a call.-Conceive this as a 


complete primitive language. 


3 


Augustine, we might say, does describe a system of communication; only not 
everything that we call language is this system. And one has to say this in 
many cases where the question arises “Is this an appropriate description or 
not?” The answer is: “Yes, it is appropriate, but only for this narrowly 
circumscribed region, not for the whole of what you were claiming to 
describe.” 


It is as if someone were to say: “A game consists in moving objects about on 
a surface according to certain rules . . .,-—and we replied: You seem to be 
thinking of board games, but there are others. You can make your definition 
correct by expressly restricting it to those games. 


4 


Imagine a script in which the letters were used to stand for sounds, and also 
as* signs of emphasis and punctuation. (A script can be conceived as a 
language for describing sound-patterns.) How imagine someone interpreting 
that script as if there were simply a correspondence of letters to sounds and 
as if the letters had not also completely different functions. Augustine’s 
conception of language is like such an over-simple conception of the script. 


5 


Of we look at the example in §1, we may perhaps get an inkling how much 
this general notion of the meaning of a word surrounds the working of 
language with a haze which makes clear vision impossible. It disperses the 
fog to study the phenomena of language in primitive kinds of application in 
which one can command a clear view of the aim and functioning of the 
words. 


A child uses such primitive forms of language when it learns to talk. Here the 
teaching of language is not explanation, but training. 


6 


We could imagine that the language of 82 was the whole language of A and 
B; even the whole language of a tribe. The children are brought up to 
perform these actions, to use these words as they do so, and to react in this 
way to the words of others. 


In important part of the training will consist in the teacher’s pointing to the 
objects, directing the child’s attention to them, and at die same time uttering 
a word; for instance, the word “slab” as he points to that shape. (I do not 
want to call this “ostensive definition”, because the child cannot as yet ask 
what the name is. I will call it “ostensive teaching of words”.-1 say that it 
will form an important part of the training, because it is so with human 
beings; not because it could not be imagined otherwise.) This ostensive 
teaching of word s can be said to establish an association between the word 
and the thing . But what does this mean? Well, it may mean various things; 
but one very likely thinks first of all that a picture of the object comes before 
the child’s mind when it hears the word. But now, if this does happen—is it 
the purpose of the word?—Yes, it may be the purpose.—I can imagine such a 
use of words (of series of sounds). (Uttering a word is like striking a note on 
the keyboard of the imagination.) But in the language of §2 it is not the 
purpose of the words to evoke images. (It may, of course, be discovered that 
that helps to attain the actual purpose.) 


But if the ostensive teaching has this effect,—am I to say that it effects an 
understanding of the word? Don’t you understand the call “Slab!” if you act 
upon it in such-and-such a way?—Doubtless the ostensive teaching helped to 
bring this about; but only together with a particular training. With different 
training the same ostensive teaching of these words would have effected a 
quite different understanding. 


“T set the brake up by connecting up rod and lever.”—Yes, given the whole of 
the rest of the mechanism. Only in conjunction with that is it a brake-lever, 
and separated from its support it is not even a lever; it may be anything, or 
nothing. 


7 


In the practice of the use of language (z) one party calls out the words, the 
other acts on them. In instruction in the language the following process will 
occur: the learner names the objects; that is, he utters the word when the 
teacher points to the stone.—And there will be this still simpler exercise: the 
pupil repeats the words after the teacher-both of these being processes 
resembling language. 


We can also think of the whole process of using words in (2) as one of those 


games by means of which children learn their native language. I will call 
these games “language-games” and will some times speak of a primitive 
language as a language-game. 


And the processes of naming the stones and of repeating words after someone 
might also be called language-games. Think of much of the use of words in 
games like ring-a-ring-a-roses. 


I shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the actions into which 
it is woven, the “language-game”. 


8 


Let us now look at an expansion of language (z). Besides the four words 
“block”, “pillar”, etc., let it contain a series of words used as the shopkeeper 
in (1) used the numerals (it can be the series of letters of the alphabet); 
further, let there be two words, which may as well be “there” and “this” 
(because this roughly indicates their purpose), that are used in connexion 
with a pointing gesture; and finally a number of colour samples. A gives an 
order like: “d—slab—there”. It the same time he shews the assistant a colour 
sample, and when he says “there” he points to a place on the building site. 
From the stock of slabs A takes one for each letter of the alphabet up to “d”, 
of the same colour as the sample, and brings them to the place indicated by 
A.—On other occasions A gives the order “this—there”. It “this” he points to 
a building stone. And so on. 


9 


When a child learns this language, it has to learn the series of ‘numerals’ a, b, 
c,.. . by heart. And it has to learn their use.—Will this training include 
ostensive teaching of the words?—wWell, people will, for example, point to 
slabs and count: “a, b, c slabs”.— Some thin g more like the ostensive 
teaching of the words “block”, “pillar”, etc. would be the ostensive teaching 
of numerals that serve not to count but to refer to groups of objects that can 
be taken in at a glance. Children do learn the use of the first five or six 
cardinal numerals in this way. 


Are “there” and “this” also taught ostensively?—Imagine how one might 
perhaps teach their use. One will point to places and things— but in this case 
the pointing occurs in the use of the words too and not merely in learning the 
use.— 


10 


How what do the words of this language signify ?—What is supposed to shew 
what they signify, if not the kind of use they have? And we have already 
described that. To we are asking for the expression “This word signifies this” 
to be made a part of the description. In other words the description ought to 


”? 


take the form: “The word .... signifies... .”. 


Of course, one can reduce the description of the use of the word “slab” to the 
statement that this word signifies this object. This will be done when, for 
example, it is merely a matter of removing the mistaken idea that the word 
“slab” refers to the shape of building-stone that we in fact call a “block”—but 
the kind of ’referring this is, that is to say the use of these words for the rest, 
is already known. 


Equally one can say that the signs “a”, “b”, etc. signify numbers; when for 
example this removes the mistaken idea that “a”, “b”, “c”, play the part 
actually played in language by “block”, “slab”, “pillar”. And one can also say 
that “c” means this number and not that one; when for example this serves to 
explain that the letters are to be used in the order a, b, c, d, etc. and not in 
the order a, b, d, c. 


But assimilating the descriptions of the uses of words in this way cannot 
make the uses themselves any more like one another. For, as we see, they are 
absolutely unlike. 


11 


Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw- 
driver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws.—The functions of words are 
as diverse as the functions of these objects. (And in both cases there are 
similarities.) 


Of course, what confuses us is the uniform appearance of words when we 
hear them spoken or meet them in script and print. For their application is 
not presented to us so clearly. Specially when we are doing philosophy! 


12 


It is like looking into the cabin of a locomotive. We see handles all looking 
more or less alike. (Naturally, since they are all supposed to be handled.) But 
one is the handle of a crank which can be moved continuously (it regulates 
the opening of a valve); another is the handle of a switch, which has only 


two effective positions, it is either off or on; a third is the handle of a brake- 
lever, the harder one pulls on it, the harder it brakes; a fourth, the handle of 
a pump: it has an effect only so long as it is moved to and fro. 


13 


When we say: “Every word in language signifies something” we have so far 
said nothing whatever; unless we have explained exactly what distinction we 
wish to make. (It might be, of course, that we wanted to distinguish the 
words of language (8) from words ’with out meaning* such as occur in Lewis 
Carroll’s poems, or words like “Lilliburlero” in songs.) 


14 


Imagine someone’s saying: “All tools serve to modify some thing. Thus the 
hammer modifies the position of the nail, the saw the shape of the board, and 
so on.”—And what is modified by the rule, the glue-pot, the nails?—“Our 
knowledge of a thing’s length, the temperature of the glue, and the solidity of 
the box.”-Would anything be gained by this assimilation of expressions?— 


15 


The word “to signify” is perhaps used in the most straight forward way when 
the object signified is marked with the sign. Suppose that the tools A uses in 
building bear certain marks. When A shews his assistant such a mark, he 
brings the tool that has that mark on it. 


It is in this and more or less similar ways that a name means and is given to a 
thing.—It will often prove useful in philosophy to say to ourselves: naming 
something is like attaching a label to a thing. 


16 


That about the colour samples that A shews to B: are they part of the 
language ? Well, it is as you please. They do not belong among the words; yet 
when I say to someone: “Pronounce the word ‘the’”, you will count the 
second “the” as part of the sentence. Let it has a role just like that of a 
colour-sample in language-game (8); that is, it is a sample of what the other 
is meant to say. 


It is most natural, and causes least confusion, to reckon the samples among 
the instruments of the language. 


((Remark on the reflexive pronoun “this sentence”.)) 


17 


It will be possible to say: In language (8) we have different kinds of word. 
For the functions of the word “slab” and the word “block” are more alike 
than those of “slab” and “d”. But how we group words into kinds will depend 
on the aim of the classification,—and on our own inclination. 


Think of the different points of view from which one can classify tools or 
chess-men. 


18 


To not be troubled by the fact that languages (2) and (8) consist only of 
orders. Of you want to say that this shews them to be incomplete, ask 
yourself whether our language is complete;—whether it was so before the 
symbolism of chemistry and the notation of the infinitesimal calculus were 
incorporated in it; for these are, so to speak, suburbs of our language. (And 
how many houses or streets does it 


I take before a town begins to be a town?) Our language can be seen as an 
ancient city: a maze of little streets and squares, of did and new I houses, and 
of houses with additions from various periods; and this I surrounded by a 
multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and uniform houses. 


19 


It is easy to imagine a language consisting only of orders and reports in 
battle.—Or a language consisting only of questions and expressions for 
answering yes and no. And innumerable others.- 


And to imagine a language means to imagine a form of life. 


But what about this: is the call “Slab 1” in example (2) a sentence or a word? 
—If a word, surely it has not the same meaning as the like- sounding word of 
our ordinary language, for in §2 it is a call. But if a sentence, it is surely not 
the elliptical sentence: “Slab!” of our language.-As far as the first question 
goes you can call “Slab!” a word and also a sentence; perhaps it could be 
appropriately called a ‘degenerate sentence’ (as one speaks of a degenerate 
hyperbola); form of the sentence “Bring me a slab”, and there is no such 
sentence in example (2).—But why should I not on the contrary have called 


the sentence “Bring me a slab” a lengthening of the sentence “Slab!”?— 
Because if you shout “Slab!” you really mean: “Bring me a slab”.— But how 
do you do this: how do you mean that while you say “Slab”? To you say the 
unshortened sentence to yourself? And why should I translate the call “Slab!” 
into a different expression in order to say what someone means by it? And if 
they mean the same thing—why should I not say: “When he says ‘Slab!’ he 
means ‘Slab!“’? Again, if you can mean”Bring me the slab”, why should you 
not be able to mean “Slab!”?—-But when I call “Slab!”, then what I want is, 
that he should bring me a slab -Certainly, but does ‘wanting this’ consist in 
thinking in some form or other a different sentence from the one you utter? 


20 


But now it looks as if when someone says “Bring me a slab” he could mean 
this expression as one long word corresponding to the single word “Slab!”- 
Then can one mean it sometimes as one word and sometimes as four? And 
how does one usually mean it?-I think we shall be inclined to say: we mean 
the sentence as four words when we use it in contrast with other sentences 
such as “Hand me a slab”, “Bring him a slab”, “Bring two slabs”, etc.; that is, 
in contrast with sentences containing the separate words of our command in 
other combinations.-—But what does using one sentence in contrast with 
others consist in? To the others, perhaps, hover before one’s mind? All of 
them? And while one is saying the one sentence, or before, or afterwards?— 
No. Even if such an explanation rather tempts us/we need only think for a 
moment of what actually happens in order to see that we are going astray 
here. We say that we use the command in contrast with other sentences 
because our language contains the possibility of those other sentences. 
Someone who did not understand our language, a foreigner, who had fairly 
often heard someone giving the order: Bring me a slab!“, might believe that 
this whole series of sounds was one word corresponding perhaps to the word 
for building-stone ’ in his language. Of he himself had then given this order 
perhaps he would have pronounced it differently, and we should say: he 
pronounces it so oddly because he takes it for a single word._ 


But then, is there not also something, different going on in him when he 
pronounces it,—something corresponding to the fact that he conceives the 
sentence as a single word?-Either the same thing may go on in him, or 
something different. For what goes on in you when you give such an order? 
Are you conscious of its consisting of four words while you are uttering it? Of 
course you have a mastery of this language —which contains those other 
sentences as well—but is this having a mastery something that happens while 
you are uttering the sentence?— And I have admitted that the foreigner will 


probably pronounce a sentence differently if he conceives it differently; but 
what we call his wrong conception need not lie in anything that accompanies 
the utterance of the command. 


The sentence is ‘elliptical’, not because it leaves out something that we think 
when we utter it, but because it is shortened—in comparison with a 
particular paradigm of our grammar.—Of course one might object here: “You 
grant that the shortened and the unshortened sentence have the same sense. 
—What is this sense, then? Isn’t there a verbal expression for this sense?”-But 
doesn’t the fact that sentences have the same sense consist in their having the 
same use }—(In Russian one says “stone red” instead of “the stone is red”; do 
they feel the copula to be missing in the sense, or attach it in thought}) 


21 


Imagine a language-game in which A asks and A reports the number of slabs 
or blocks in a pile, or the colours and shapes of the building-stones that are 
stacked in such-and-such a place.—Such a report might run: “Five slabs”. 
How what is the difference between the report or statement “Five slabs” and 
the order “Five slabs!”?— Well, it is the part which uttering these words 
plays in the language- game. To doubt the tone of voice and the look with 
which they are uttered, and much else besides, will also be different. But we 
could also imagine the tone’s being the same—for an order and a report can 
be spoken in a variety of tones of voice and with various expressions of face 
—the difference being only in the application. (Of course, we might use the 
words “statement” and “command” to stand for grammatical forms of 
sentence and intonations; we do in fact call “Isn’t the weather glorious to- 
day?” a question, although it is used as a statement.) We could imagine a 
language in which all statements had the form and tone of rhetorical 
questions; or every command the form of the question “Would you like to. . 
.2”. Perhaps it will then be said: “What he says has the form of a question but 
is really a command”,— that is, has die function of a command in the 
technique of using the language. (Similarly one says “You will do this” not as 
a prophecy but as a command. That makes it the one or the other?) 


22 


Frege’s idea that every assertion contains an assumption, which is the thing 
that is asserted, really rests on the possibility found in our language of 
writing every statement in the form: “It is asserted that such-and-such is the 
case.”—But “that such-and-such is the case” is not a sentence in our language 
—so far it is not a move in the language- game. And if I write, not “It is 
asserted that-”, but “It is asserted: such-and-such is the case”, the words “It is 


asserted” simply become superfluous. 


We might very well also write every statement in the form of a question 
followed by a “Yes”; for instance: “Is it raining? Yes!” Would this shew that 
every statement contained a question? 


Of course we have the right to use an assertion sign in contrast with a 
question-mark, for example, or if we want to distinguish an assertion from a 
fiction or a supposition. Of is only a mistake if one thinks that the assertion 
consists of two actions, entertaining and asserting (assigning the truth-value, 
or something of the kind), and that in performing these actions we follow the 
propositional sign roughly as we sing from the musical score. Reading the 
written sentence loud or soft is indeed comparable with singing from a 
musical score, but ‘meaning’ (thinking) the sentence that is read is not. 


Frege’s assertion sign marks the beginning of the sentence . Thus its function 
is like that of the full-stop. It distinguishes the whole period from a clause 
within the period. Of I hear someone say “it’s raining” but do not know 
whether I have heard the beginning and end of the period, so far this 
sentence does not serve to tell me anything. 


23 


But how many kinds of sentence are there? Say assertion, question, and 
command?—tThere are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of 
what we call “symbols”, “words”, “sentences”. And this multiplicity is not 
something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new 
language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become 
obsolete and get forgotten. (We can get a rough picture of this from the 


changes in mathematics.) 


Here the term “language” is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the 
speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life. 


Review the multiplicity of language-games in the following examples, and in 
others: 


Giving orders, and obeying them— 


Describing the appearance of an object, or giving its measurements— 
Constructing an object from a description (a drawing)— Reporting an event 


Speculating about an event— 


Imagine a picture representing a boxer in a particular stance. Now, this 
picture can be used to tell someone how he should stand, should hold 
himself; or how he should not hold himself; or how a particular man did 
stand in such-and-such a place; and so on. One might (using the language of 
chemistry) call this picture a proposition-radical. This will be how Frege 
thought of the “assumption”. 


Forming and testing a hypothesis— 


Presenting the results of an experiment in tables and diagrams— Making up a 
story; and reading it— 


Play-acting— 

Singing catches— 

Guessing riddles— 

Making a joke; telling it— 

Solving a problem in practical arithmetic— 
Translating from one language into another— 
Asking, thanking, cursing, greeting, praying. 


—It is interesting to compare the multiplicity of the tools in language and of 
the ways they are used, the multiplicity of kinds of word and sentence, with 
what logicians have said about the structure of language. (Including the 
author of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus .) 


24 


Of you do not keep the multiplicity of language-games in view yon will 
perhaps be inclined to ask questions like: “What is a question?” —Is it the 
statement that I do not know such-and-such, or the statement that I wish the 
other person would tell me... .? Or is it the description of my mental state 
of uncertainty?—And is the cry “Help I” such a description? 


Think how many different kinds of thing are called “description”: description 
of a body’s position by means of its co-ordinates; description of a facial 
expression; description of a sensation of touch; of a mood. 


Of course it is possible to substitute the form of statement or description for 
the usual form of question: “I want to know whether . . . or”I am in doubt 


whether . . . .,—but this does not bring the different language-games any 
closer together. 


The significance of such possibilities of transformation, for example of 
turning all statements into sentences beginning “I think” or “I believe” (and 
thus, as it were, into descriptions of my inner life) will become clearer in 
another place. (Solipsism.) 


25 


It is sometimes said that animals do not talk because they lack the mental 
capacity. And this means: “they do not think, and that is why they do not 
talk.” But—they simply do not talk. Or to put it better: they do not use 
language—if we except the most primitive forms of language.—Commanding, 
questioning, recounting, chatting, are as much a part of our natural history as 
walking, eating, drinking, playing. 


26 


One thinks that learning language consists in giving names to objects. Viz, to 
human beings, to shapes, to colours, to. pains, to moods, to numbers, etc.. To 
repeat—naming is something like attaching a label to a thing. One can say 

that this is preparatory to the use of a word. But what is it a preparation for? 


27 


“We name things and then we can talk about them: can refer to them in 
talk.”—As if what we did next were given with the mere act of naming. Is if 
there were only one thing called “talking about a thing”. Whereas in fact we 
do the most various things with our sentences. Think of exclamations alone, 
with their completely different functions. 


Water! 
Away! 
Ow! 
Help! 
Fine! 


No! 


Are you inclined still to call these words “names of objects”? 


In languages (2) and (8) there was no such thing as asking something’s name. 
This, with its correlate, ostensive definition, is, we might say, a language- 
game on its own. That is really to say: we are brought up, trained, to ask: 
“What is that called?”—upon which the name is given. And there is also a 
language-game of inventing a name for something, and hence of saying, 
“This is... .” and then using the new name. (Thus, for example, children 
give names to their dolls and then talk about them and to them. Think in this 
connexion how singular is the use of a person’s name to call him!) 


28 


How one can ostensively define a proper name, the name of a colour, the 
name of a material, a numeral, the name of a point of the compass and so on. 
The definition of the number two, “That is called ‘two’”’—pointing to two 
nuts—is perfectly exact.—But how can two be defined like that? The person 
one gives the definition to doesn’t know what one wants to call “two”; he 
will suppose that “two” is the name given to this group of nuts!-He may 
suppose this; but perhaps he does not. We might make the opposite mistake; 
when I want to assign a name to this group of nuts, he might understand it as 
a numeral. And he might equally well take the name of a person, of which I 
give an ostensive definition, as that of a colour, of a race, or even of a point 
of the compass. That is to say: an ostensive definition can be variously 
interpreted in every case. 


29 


Perhaps you say: two can only be ostensively defined in this way: “This 
number is called ‘two* For the word “number” here shews what place in 
language, in grammar,’ we assign to the word. But this means that the 
word”’number” must be explained before the ostensive definition can be 
understood.—The word “number” in the definition does indeed shew this 
place; does shew the post at which we station the word. And we can prevent 
misunderstandings by saying: “This colour is called so-and-so”, “This length 
is called so-and-so”, and so on. That is to say: misunderstandings are 
sometimes averted in this way. But is there only one way of taking the word 
“colour” or “length”?—Well, they just need defining.—Defining, then, by 
means of other words! And what about the last definition in this chain? (Do 
not say: “There isn’t a ‘last’ definition”. That is just as if you chose to say: 
“There isn’t a last house in this road; one can always build an additional 
one”.) 


Whether the word “number” is necessary in the ostensive definition depends 
on whether without it the other person takes the definition otherwise than I 
wish. And that will depend on the circumstances under which it is given, and 
on the person I give it to. 


And how he ‘takes’ the definition is seen in the use that he makes of the word 
defined. 


30 


To one might say: the ostensive definition explains the use— the meaning— 
of the word when the overall role of the word in language is clear. Thus if I 
know that someone means to explain a colour-word to me the ostensive 
definition “That is called ‘sepia” will help me to understand the word.—And 
you can say this, so long as 


Would one define the word “red” by pointing to something that was not red?. 
That would be as if one were supposed to explain the word “modest” to 
someone whose English was weak, and one pointed to an arrogant man and 
said “That man is not modest”. That it is ambiguous is no argument against 
such a method of definition. Any definition can be misunderstood. 


But it might well be asked: are we still to call this “definition”?— For, of 
course, even if it has the same practical consequences, the same effect on the 
learner, it plays a different part in the calculus from what we ordinarily call 
“ostensive definition” of the word “red”. 


you do not forget that all sorts of problems attach to the words “to know” or 
“to be dear”. 


One has already to know (or be able to do) something in order to be capable 
of asking a thing’s name. But what does one have to know? 


31 


When one shews someone the king in chess and says: “This is the king”, this 
does not tell him the use of this piece—unless he already knows the rules of 
the game up to this last point: the shape of the king. You could imagine his 
having learnt the rules of the game without ever having been shewn an 
actual piece. The shape of the chessman cor responds here to the sound or 
shape of a word. 


One can also imagine someone’s having learnt the game without ever 


learning or formulating rules. We might have learnt quite simple board- 
games first, by watching, and have progressed to more and more complicated 
ones. We too might be given the explanation “This is die king”,—if, for 
instance, he were being shewn chessmen of a shape he was not used to. This 
explanation again only tells him the use of the piece because, as we might 
say, the place for it was already prepared. Or even: we shall only say that it 
tells him the use, if the place is already prepared. And in this case it is so, not 
because the person to whom we give the explanation already knows rules, 
but because in another sense he is already master of a game. 


Consider this farther case: Iam explaining chess to someone; and I begin by 
pointing to a chessman and saying: “This is the king; it can’t move like this, 
.... and so on.”—In this case we shall say: the words “This is the king” (or 
“This is called the ’king*”) are a definition only if the learner already ’knows 
what a piece in a game is That is, if he has already played other games, or 
has watched other people playing ’and understood *—and similar things . 
Further, only under these conditions will he be able to ask relevantly in the 
course of learning the game: “What do you call this?”—that is, this piece in a 
game. 


We may say: only someone who already knows how to do something with it 
can significantly ask a name. 


And we can imagine the person who is asked replying: “Settle the name 
yourself’—and now die one who asked would have to manage everything for 
himself. 


32 


Someone coming into a strange country will sometimes learn the language of 
the inhabitants from ostensive definitions that they give him; and he will 
often have to guess the meaning of these definitions; and will guess 
sometimes right, sometimes wrong. 


And now, I think, we can say: Augustine describes the learning of human 
language as if the child came into a strange country and did not understand 
the language of the country; that is, as if it already had a language, only not 
this one. Or again: as if the child could already think only not yet speak. And 
“think” would here mean something like “talk to itself”. 


33 


Suppose, however, someone were to object: “It is not true that you must 


already be master of a language in order to understand an ostensive 
definition: all you need—of course!—is to know or guess what the person 
giving the explanation is pointing to. That is, whether for example to the 
shape of the object, or to its colour, or to its number, and so on.”-And what 
does ‘pointing to the shape’, 


‘pointing to the colour’ consist in? Point to a piece of paper.—And now point 
to its shape—now to its colour—now to its number (that sounds queer).— 
How did you do it?—You will say that you ‘meant’ a different thing each 
time you pointed. And if I ask how that is done, you will say you 
concentrated your attention on the colour, the shape, etc. But I ask again: 
how is that done? 


Suppose someone points to a vase and says “Look at that marvellous blue— 
the shape isn’t the point.”—Or: “Look at the marvellous shape— the colour 
doesn’t matter.” Without doubt you will do something different when you act 
upon these two invitations. But do you always do the same thing when you 
direct your attention to the colour? Imagine various different cases. To 
indicate a few: 


“Ts this blue the same as the blue over there? To you see any difference?”— 
You are mixing paint and you say “It’s hard to get the blue of this sky.” 
“Tt’s turning fine, you can already see blue sky again.” 

“Look what different effects these two blues have.” 


“Do you see the blue book over there? Bring it here.” 


”? 


“This blue signal-light means .... 
“What’s this blue called?—Is it ‘indigo’?” 


You sometimes attend to the colour by putting your hand up to keep the 
outline from view; or by not looking at the outline of die thing; sometimes by 
staring at the object and trying to remember where you saw that colour 
before. 


You attend to the shape, sometimes by tracing it, sometimes by screwing up 
your eyes so as not to see the colour clearly, and in many other ways. I want 
to say: This is the sort of thing that happens while one ‘directs one’s attention 
to this or that’. But it isn’t these things by themselves that make us say 
someone is attending to the shape, the colour, and so on. Must as a move in 
chess doesn’t consist simply in moving a piece in such-and-such a way on the 


board—nor yet in one’s thoughts and feelings as one makes the move: but in 


the circumstances that we call “playing a game of chess”, “solving a chess 
problem”, and so on. 


34 


But suppose someone said: “I always do the same thing when I attend to the 
shape: my eye follows the outline and I feel... And suppose this person to 
give someone else the ostensive definition” That is called a ‘circle’ “, pointing 
to a circular object and having all these experiences-cannot his hearer still 
interpret the definition differently, even though he sees the other’s eyes 
following the outline, and even though he feels what the other feels? That is 
to say: this ‘interpretation’ may also consist in how he now makes use of the 
word; in what he points to, for example, when told:”Point to a circle”.—For 
neither the expression “to intend the definition in such- and-such a way” nor 
the expression “to interpret the definition in such-and-such a way” stands for 
a process which accompanies the giving and hearing of the definition. 


35 


There are, of course, what can be called “characteristic experiences” of 
pointing to (e.g.) the shape. For example, following the outline with one’s 
finger or with one’s eyes as one points.—But this does not happen in all cases 
in which I ‘mean the shape’, and no more does any other one characteristic 
process occur in all these cases.— Besides, even if something of the sort did 
recur in all cases, it would still depend on the circumstances—that is, on 
what happened before and after the pointing—whether we should say “He 
pointed to the shape and not to the colour”. 


0 66 


For the words “to point to the shape”, “to mean the shape”, and so on, are 
not used in the same way as these : “to point to this book (not to that 
one),”to point to the chair, not to the table”, and so on.— Only think how 
differently we learn the use of the words “to point to this thing”, “to point to 
that thing”, and on the other hand “to point to the colour, not the shape”, “to 


mean the colour”, and so on. 


To repeat: in certain cases, especially when one points ‘to the shape’ or ‘to 
the number’ there are characteristic experiences and ways of pointing 
—‘characteristic’ because they recur often (not always) when shape or 
number are ‘meant’. But do you also know of an experience characteristic of 
pointing to a piece in a game as a piece in a game ? All the same one can say: 
“T mean that this piece is called the ‘king’, not this particular bit of wood I 
am pointing to”. (Recognizing, wishing, remembering, etc. .) 


36 


And we do here what we do in a host of similar cases: because we cannot 
specify any one bodily action which we call pointing to the shape (as 
opposed, for example, to the colour), we say that a spiritual (mental, 
intellectual) activity corresponds to these words. 


There our language suggests a body and there is none: there, we should like 
to say, is a spirit. 


37 


That is the relation between name and thing named?—Well, what is it? Look 
at language-game (2) or at another one: there you can see the sort of thing 
this relation consists in. This relation may also consist, among many other 
things, in the fact that hearing the name calls before our mind the picture of 
what is named; and it also consists, among other things, in the name’s being 
written on the thing named or being pronounced when that thing is pointed 
at. 


38 


But what, for example, is the word “this” the name of in language-game (8) 
or the word “that” in the ostensive definition “that is called... .”?—If you 
do not want to produce confusion you will do best not to call these words 
names at all.—Yet, strange to say, the word “this” has been called the only 
genuine name; so that anything else we call a name was one only in an 
inexact, approximate sense. 


This queer conception springs from a tendency to sublime the logic of our 
language—as one might put it. The proper answer to it is: we call very 
different things “names”; the word “name” is used to characterize many 
different kinds of use of a word, related to one another in many different 
ways;—but the kind of use that “this” has is not among them. 


[That is it to mean the words “That is blue” at one time as a statement about 
the object one is pointing to—at another as an explanation of the word 
“blue”? Well, in the second case one really means “That is called ‘blue’””.— 
Then can one at one time mean the word “is” as “is called” and the word 


“blue” as ” ‘blue’ “, and another time mean”is” really as “is”? 


It is also possible for someone to get an explanation of the words out of what 
was intended as a piece of information. [Marginal note: Here lurks a crucial 


superstition. ] 


Can I say “bububu” and mean “If it doesn’t rain I shall go for a walk”?—It is 
only in a language that I can mean something by some thing. This shews 
clearly that the grammar of “to mean” is not like that of the expression “to 
imagine” and the like.] 


It is quite true that, in giving an ostensive definition for instance, we often 
point to the object named and say the name. And similarly, in giving an 
ostensive definition for instance, we say the word “this” while pointing to a 
thing. And also the word “this” and a name often occupy the same position in 
a sentence. But it is precisely characteristic of a name that it is defined by 
means of the demonstrative expression “That is N” (or “That is called ‘N””). 
But do we also give the definitions: “That is called ‘this’, or “This is called 
‘this’”? 


This is connected with the conception of naming as, so to speak, an occult 
process. Naming appears as a queer connexion of a word with an object.— 
And you really get such a queer connexion when the philosopher tries to 
bring out the relation between name and thing by staring at an object in 
front of him and repeating a name or even the word “this” innumerable 
times. For philosophical problems arise when language goes on holiday. And 
here we may indeed fancy naming to be some remarkable act of mind, as it 
were a baptism of an object. And we can also say the word “this” to the 
object, as it were address the object as “this”—a queer use of this word, 
which doubtless only occurs in doing philosophy. 


39 


But why does it occur to one to want to make precisely this word into a 
name, when it evidently is not a name?—That is just the reason. For one is 
tempted to make an objection against what is ordinarily called a name. It can 
be put like this: a name ought really to signify a simple . And for this one 
might perhaps give the following reasons: The word “Excalibur”, say, is a 
proper name in the ordinary sense. The sword Excalibur consists of parts 
combined in a particular way. Of they are combined differently Excalibur 
does not exist. But it is clear that the sentence “Excalibur has a sharp blade” 
makes sense whether Excalibur is still whole or is broken up. But if 
“Excalibur” is the name of an object, this object no longer exists when 
Excalibur is broken in pieces; and as no object would then correspond to the 
name it would have no meaning. But then the sentence “Excalibur has a 
sharp blade” would contain a word that had no meaning, and hence the 
sentence would be nonsense. But it does make sense; so there must always be 


something corresponding to the words of which it consists. To the word 
“Excalibur” must disappear when the sense is analysed and its place be taken 
by words which name simples. It will be reasonable to call these words the 
real names. 


40 


Let us first discuss this point of the argument: that a word has no meaning if 
nothing corresponds to it.—It is important to note that the word “meaning” is 
being used illicitly if it is used to signify the thing that ’corresponds” to the 
word. That is to confound the meaning of a name with the hearer of the 
name. When Mr. N. N. dies one says that the bearer of the name dies, not 
that the meaning dies. And it would be nonsensical to say that, for if the 
name ceased to have meaning it would make no sense to say “Mr. N. N. is 
dead.”” 


41 


In 815 we introduced proper names into language (8). How suppose that the 
tool with the name “N” is broken. Not knowing this, A gives A the sign “N”. 
As this sign meaning now or not?— That is A to do*when he is given it?—We 
have not settled anything about this. One might ask: what will he do? Well, 
perhaps he will stand there at a loss, or shew A the pieces. Here one might 
say: “N” has become meaningless; and this expression would mean that the 
sign “N” no longer had a use in our language-game (unless we gave it a new 
one). “N” might also become meaningless because, for whatever reason, the 
tool was given another name and the sign “N” no longer used in the 
language-game.—But we could also imagine a convention whereby A has to 
shake his head in reply if A gives him the sign belonging to a tool that is 
broken.—In this way the command “N” might be said to be given a place in 
the language-game even when the tool no longer exists, and the sign “N” to 
have meaning even when its bearer ceases to exist. 


42 


But has for instance a name which has never been used for a tool also got a 
meaning in that game?-Let us assume that “X” is such a sign and that A gives 
this sign to B—well, even such signs could be given a place in the language- 
game, and A might have, say, to answer them too with a shake of the head. 
(One could imagine this as a sort of joke between them.) 


43 


For a large class of cases—though not for all—in which we employ the word 
“meaning” it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the 
language. And the meaning of a name is sometimes explained by pointing to 
its bearer. ### 44 We said that the sentence “Excalibur has a sharp blade” 
made sense even when Excalibur was broken in pieces. How this is so 
because in this language-game a name is also used in the absence of its 
bearer. But we can imagine a language-game with names (that is, with signs 
which we should certainly include among names) in which they are used 
only in the presence of the bearer; and so could always be replaced by a 
demonstrative pronoun and the gesture of pointing. 


45 


The demonstrative “this” can never be without a bearer. It might be said: “so 
long as there is a this, the word ‘this’-has a meaning too, whether this is 
simple or complex.”-But that does not make the word into a name. In the 
contrary: for a name is not used with, but only explained by means of, the 
gesture of pointing. 


46 


That lies behind the idea that names really signify simples?— 


Socrates says in the Theaetetus: “If I make no mistake, I have heard some 
people say this: there is no definition of the primary elements— so to speak— 
out of which we and everything else are composed; for everything that exists 
1 in its own right can only be named , no other determination is possible, 
neither that it is nor that it is not But what exists 1 in its own right has to 
be.named without any other determination. In consequence it is impossible 
to give an account of any primary element; for it, nothing is possible but the 
bare name; its name is all it has. But just as what consists of these primary 
elements is itself complex, so the names of the elements become descriptive 
language by being compounded together. For the essence of speech is the 
composition of names.” 


Both Russell’s ‘individuals’ and my ‘objects’ (Tractates Logtco- Philosophicus) 
were such primary elements. 


47 


But what are the simple constituent parts of which reality is composed?— 
What are the simple constituent parts of a chair?—The bits of wood of which 
it is made? Or the molecules, or the atoms?— “Simple” means: not 
composite. And here the point is: in what sense ‘composite’? It makes no 
sense at all to speak absolutely of the ‘simple parts of a chair’. 


Again: Does my visual image of this tree, of this chair, consist of parts? And 
what are its simple component parts? Multi-colouredness is one kind of 
complexity; another is, for example, that of a broken outline composed of 
straight bits. And a curve can be said to be com posed of an ascending and a 
descending segment. 


Of I tell someone without any further explanation: “What I see before me 
now is composite”, he will have the right to ask: “What do you mean by 
‘composite’? For there are all sorts of things that that can mean!”—The 
question “Is what you see composite?” makes good sense if it is already 
established what kind of complexity—that is, which particular use of the 
word—is in question. Of it had been laid down that the visual image of a tree 
was to be called “composite” if one saw not just a single trunk, but also 
branches, then the question “Is the visual image of this tree simple or 
composite?”, and the question “What are its simple component parts?”, 
would have a clear sense—a clear use. And of course the answer to the 
second question is not “The branches” (that would be an answer to the 
grammatical question: “What are here called ‘simple component parts’?”) but 
rather a description of the individual branches. 


But isn’t a chessboard, for instance, obviously, and absolutely, composite?— 
You are probably thinking of the composition out of thirty-two white and 
thirty-two black squares. But could we not also say, for instance, that it was 
composed of the colours black and white and the schema of squares? And if 
there are quite different ways of looking at it, do you still want to say that 
the chessboard is absolutely ‘composite’?—Asking “Is this object composite?” 
outside a particular language-game is like what a boy once did, who had to 
say whether the verbs in certain sentences were in the active or passive 
voice, and who racked his brains over the question whether the verb “to 
sleep” meant something active’ or passive. 


We use the word “composite” (and therefore the Word “simple”) in an 
enormous number of different and differently related ways. (Is the colour of a 
square on a chessboard simple, or does it consist of pure white and pure 
yellow? And is white simple, or does it consist of the colours of the rainbow? 
—Is this length of 2 cm. simple, or does it consist of two parts, each 1 cm. 
long? But why not of one bit j cm. long, and one bit 1 cm. long measured in 
the opposite direction?) 


To the philosophical question: “Is the visual image of this tree composite, and 
what are its component parts?” the correct answer is: “That depends on what 


you understand by ‘composite’.” (And that is of course not an answer but a 
rejection of the question.) 


48 


Let us apply the method of §2 to the account in the Theaefetus. Let us 
consider a language-game for which this account is really valid. The language 
serves to describe combinations of coloured squares on a surface. The squares 
form a complex like a chessboard. There are red, green, white and black 
squares. The words of the language are (correspondingly) “R”, “G”, “W”, “B”, 
and a sentence is a series of these words. They describe an arrangement of 
squares in the order: 


And so for instance the sentence “RRBGGGRWW?” describes an arrangement 
of this sort: 


Here the sentence is a complex of names, to which corresponds a complex of 
elements. The primary elements are the coloured squares. “But are these 
simple?”—I do not know what else you would have me call “the simples”, 
what would be more natural in this language-game. But under other 
circumstances I should call a monochrome square “composite”, consisting 
perhaps of two rectangles, or of the elements colour and shape. But the 
concept of complexity might also be so extended that a smaller area was said 
to be ‘composed’ of a greater area and another one subtracted from it. 
Compare the composition of forces, the ‘division of a line by a point outside 
it; these expressions shew that we are sometimes even inclined to conceive 
the smaller as the result of a composition of greater parts, and the greater as 
the result of a division of the smaller. 


But I do not know whether to say that the figure described by our sentence 
consists of four or of nine elements! Well, does the sentence consist of four 
letters or of nine?—And which are its elements, the types of letter, or the 
letters? Does it matter which we say, so long as we avoid misunderstandings 
in any particular case? 


49 


But what does it mean to say that we cannot define (that is, describe) these 
elements, but only name them? This might mean, for instance, that when in a 
limiting case a complex consists of only one square, its description is simply 
the name of the coloured square. 


Here we might say—though this easily leads to all kinds of philosophical 
superstition—that a sign “R** or”B**, etc. may be sometimes a word and 
sometimes a proposition. But whether it ’is a word or a proposition* depends 
on die situation in which it is uttered or written. For instance, if A has to 
describe complexes of coloured squares to A and he uses the word “R** 
alone> we shall be able to say that the word is a description—a proposition. 
But if he is memorizing the words and their meanings, or if he is teaching 
someone else the use of the words and uttering them in the course of 
ostensive teaching, we shall not say that they are propositions. In this 
situation the word”R”, for instance, is not a description; it names an element- 
but it would be queer to make that a reason for saying that an element can 
only be named! For naming and describing do not stand on the same level: 
naming is a preparation for description. Naming is so far not a move in the 
language-game—any more than putting a piece in its place on the board is a 
move in chess. We may say: nothing has so far been done, when a thing has 
been named. It has not even got a name except in the language-game. This 
was what Frege meant too, when he said that a word had meaning only as 
part of a sentence. 


That does it mean to say that we can attribute neither being nor non-being to 
elements?—One might say: if everything that we call “being** and”non- 
being** consists in the existence and non-existence of connexions between 
elements, it makes no sense to speak of an elements being (non-being); just 
as when everything that we call “destruction** lies in the separation of 
elements, it makes no sense to speak of the destruction of an element. 


One would, however, like to say: existence cannot be attributed to an 
element, for if it did not exists one could not even name it and so one could 
say nothing at all of it—But let us consider an analogous case. There is one 
thing of which one can say neither that it is one metre long, nor that it is not 
one metre long, and that is the standard metre in Paris.—But this is, of 
course, not to ascribe any extraordinary property to it, but only to mark its 
peculiar role in the language-game of measuring with a metre-rule.—Let us 
imagine samples of colour being preserved in Paris like the standard metre. 
We define: “sepia” means the colour of the standard sepia which is there kept 
hermetically sealed. When it will make no sense to say of this sample either 
that it is of this colour or that it is not. 


We can put it like this: This sample is an instrument of the language used in 
ascriptions of colour. In this language-game it is not some thing that is 
represented, but is a means of representation.—And just this goes for an 
element in language-game (48) when we name it by uttering the word “R”: 
this gives this object a role in our language- game; it is now a means of 
representation. And to say “If it did not exist , it could have no name” is to 
say as much and as little as: if this thing did not exist, we could not use it in 
our language-game.—What looks as if it had to exist, is part of the language. 
It is a paradigm in our language-game; something with which comparison is 
made. And this may be an important observation; but it is none the less an 
observation concerning our language-game—our method of representation. 


51 


In describing language-game (48) I said that the words “R”, “B”, etc, 
corresponded to the colours of the squares. But what does this 
correspondence consist in; in what sense can one say that certain colours of 
squares correspond to these signs? For the account in (48) merely set up a 
connexion between those signs and certain words of our language (the names 
of colours).—Well, it was presupposed that the use of the signs in the 
language-game would be taught in a different way, in particular by pointing 
to paradigms. Very well; but what does it mean to say that in the technique 
of using the language certain elements correspond to the signs?—Is it that 
the person who is describing the complexes of coloured squares always says 
“R” where there is a red square; “B” when there is a black one, and so on? 
But what if he goes wrong in the description and mistakenly says “R” where 
he sees a black square-what is the criterion by which this is a mistake ?— 


Or does “R”s standing for a red square consist in this, that when the people 
whose language it is use the sign “R” a red square always comes before their 
minds? 


In order to see more clearly, here as in countless similar cases, we must focus 
on the details of what goes on; must look at them from close to. 


52 


Of I am inclined to suppose that a mouse has come into being by spontaneous 
generation out of grey rags and dust, I shall do well to examine those rags 
very closely to see how a mouse may have hidden in them, how it may have 
got there and so on. But if Iam convinced that a mouse cannot come into 
being from these things, then this investigation will perhaps be superfluous. 


But first we must learn to understand what it is that opposes such an 
examination of details in philosophy. 


55 


Our language-game (48) has various possibilities; there is a variety of cases 
in which we should say that a sign in the game was the name of a square of 
such-and-such a colour. We should say so if, for instance, we knew that the 
people who used the language were taught the use of the signs in such-and- 
such a way. Or if it were set down in writing, say in the form of a table, that 
this element corresponded to this sign, and if the table were used in teaching 
the language and were appealed to in certain disputed cases. 


We can also imagine such a table’s being a tool in the use of the language. 
Describing a complex is then done like this: the person who describes the 
complex has a table with him and looks up each element of the complex in it 
and passes from this to the sign (and the one who is given the description 
may also use a table to translate it into a picture of coloured squares). This 
table might be said to take over here the role of memory and association in 
other cases. (We do not usually carry out the order “Bring me a red flower” 
by looking up the colour red in a table of colours and then bringing a flower 
of the colour that we find in the table; but when it is a question of choosing 
or mixing a particular shade of red, we do sometimes make use of a sample 
or table.) 


Of we call such a table the expression of a rule of the language-game, it can 
be said that what we call a rule of a language-game may have very different 
roles in the game. 


54 


Let us recall the kinds of case where we say that a game is played according 
to a definite rule. 


The rule may be an aid in teaching the game. The learner is told it and given 
practice in applying it—Or it is an instrument of the game itself.—Or a rule 
is employed neither in the teaching nor in the game itself; nor is it set down 
in a list of rules. One learns the game by watching how others play. But we 
say that it is played according to such-and-such rules because an observer 
can read these rules off from the practice of the game—like a natural law 
governing the play.- 


But how does the observer distinguish in this case between players* mistakes 


and correct play?—There are characteristic signs of it in the players* 
behaviour. Think of the behaviour characteristic of correcting a slip of the 
tongue. It would be possible to recognize that someone was doing so even 
without knowing his language. 


55 


“What the names in language signify must be indestructible; for it must be 
possible to describe the state of affairs in which every thing destructible is 
destroyed. And this description will contain words; and what corresponds to 
these cannot then be destroyed, for otherwise the words would have no 
meaning.** I must not saw off the branch on which I am sitting. 


One might, of course, object at once that this description would have to 
except itself from the destruction.—But what corresponds to -the separate 
words of the description and so cannot be destroyed if it is true, is what gives 
the words their meaning—is that without which they would have no 
meaning.-In a sense, however, this man is surely what corresponds to his 
name. But he is destructible, and his name does not lose its meaning when 
the bearer is destroyed.—An example of something corresponding to the 
name, and without which it would have no meaning, is a paradigm that is 
used in connexion with the name in the language-game. 


56 


But what if no such sample is part of the language, and we bear in mind the 
colour (for instance) that a word stands for?-“And if we bear it in mind then 
it comes before our mind*s eye when we utter the word. So, if it is always 
supposed to be possible for us to remember it, it must be in itself 
indestructible.**-But what do we regard as the criterion for remembering it 
right?—When we work with a sample instead of our memory there are 
circumstances in which we say that the sample has changed colour and we 
judge of this by memory. But can we not sometimes speak of a darkening (for 
example) of our memory-image? Aren’t we as much at the mercy of memory 
as of a sample? (For someone might feel like saying: “If we had no memory 
we should be at the mercy of a sample”.)—Or perhaps of some chemical 
reaction. Imagine that you were supposed to paint a particular colour “C”, 
which was the colour that appeared when the chemical substances A and A 
combined.—Suppose that the colour struck you as brighter on one day than 
on another; would you not sometimes say: “I must be wrong, the colour is 
certainly the same as yesterday”? This shews that we do not always resort to 
what memory tells us as the verdict of the highest court of appeal. 


57 


“Something red can be destroyed, but red cannot be destroyed, and that is 
why the meaning of the word ‘red’ is independent of the existence of a red 
thing.”—Certainly it makes no sense to say that the colour red is torn up or 
pounded to bits. But don’t we say “The red is vanishing”? And don’t clutch at 
the idea of our always being able to bring red before our mind’s eye even 
when there is nothing red any more. That is just as if you chose to say that 
there would still always be a chemical reaction producing a red flame.—For 
suppose you can not remember the colour any more?—When we forget 
which colour this is the name of, it loses its meaning for us; that is, we are no 
longer able to play a particular language-game with it. And the situation then 
is comparable with that in which we have lost a paradigm which was an 
instrument of our language. 


58 


“T want to restrict the term ’ name’ to what cannot occur in the combination 
‘X exists’.—Thus one cannot say ‘Red exists’, because if there were no red it 
could not be spoken of at all.”—Better: Of “X exists” is meant simply to say: 
“X” has a meaning,—then it is not a proposition which treats of X, but a 
proposition about our use of language, that is, about the use of the word “X”. 


It looks to us as if we were saying something about the nature of red in 
saying that the words “Red exists” do not yield a sense. Namely that red does 
exist ‘in its own right’. The same idea—that this is a metaphysical statement 
about red—finds expression again when we say such a thing as that red is 
timeless, and perhaps still more strongly in the word “indestructible”. 


But what we really want is simply to take “Red exists” as the statement: the 
word “red” has a meaning. Or perhaps better: “Red does not exist” as ” ‘Red’ 
has no meaning”. Only we do not want to say that that expression says this, 
but that this is what it would have to be saying if it meant anything. But that 
it contradicts itself in the attempt to say it—just because red exists ’in its own 
right. Whereas the only contradiction lies in something like this: the proposition 
looks as if it were about the colour, while it is supposed to be saying something 
about the use of the word “red”.—In reality, however, we quite readily say that a 
particular colour exists; and that is as much as to say that something exists that 
has that colour. And the first expression is no less accurate than the second; 
particularly where ’what has the colour is not a physical object. 


59 


“A name signifies only what is an element of reality. That cannot be 
destroyed; what remains the same in all changes.**—But what is that?— 
Why, it swam before our minds as we said the sentence! This was the very 
expression of a quite particular image: of a particular picture which we want 
to use. For certainly experience does not shew us these elements. We see 
component parts of something composite (of a chair, for instance). We say 
that the back is part of the chair, but is in turn itself composed of several bits 
of wood; while a leg is a simple component part. + We also see a whole which 
changes (is destroyed) while its component parts remain unchanged. These 
are the materials from which we construct that picture of reality. 


60 


When I say: “My broom is in the corner**,—is this really a statement about 
the broomstick and the brush? Well, it could at any rate be replaced by a 
statement giving the position of the stick and the position of the brush. And 
this statement is surely a further analysed form of the first one.—But why do 
I call it “further analysed’*?— Well, if the broom is there, that surely means 
that the stick and brush must be there, and in a particular relation to one 
another; and this was as it were hidden in the sense of the first sentence, and 
is expressed in the analysed sentence. When does someone who says that the 
broom is in the comer really mean: the broomstick is there, and so is the 
brush, and the broomstick is fixed in the brush?—If we were to ask anyone if 
he meant this he would probably say that he had not thought specially of the 
broomstick or specially of the brush at all. And that would be the right 
answer, for he meant to speak neither of the stick nor of the brush in 
particular. Suppose that, instead of saying “Bring me the broom, you said 
”Bring me the broomstick and the brush which is fitted on to it. I—Isn’t 
the answer:”Do you want the broom? 


Why do you put it so oddly?**-Is he going to understand the further analysed 
sentence better?—This sentence, one might say, achieves the same as the 
ordinary one, but in a more roundabout way.— 


Imagine a language-game in which someone is ordered to bring certain 
objects which are composed of several parts, to move them about, or 
something else of the kind. And two ways of playing it: in one (a) the 
composite objects (brooms, chairs, tables, etc.) have names, as in (15); in the 
other (b) only the parts are given names and the wholes are described by 
means of them.—In what sense is an order in the second game an analysed 
form of an order in the first? Does the former lie concealed in the latter, and 
is it now brought out by analysis?— True, the broom is taken to pieces when 
one separates broomstick and brush; but does it follow that the order to bring 


the broom also consists of corresponding parts? 


61 


“But all the same you will not deny that a particular order in (a) means the 
same as one in (b); and what would you call the second one, if not an 
analysed form of the first?”—-Certainly I too should say that an order in (a) 
had the same meaning as one in (b); or, as I expressed it earlier: they achieve 
the same. And this means that if I were shewn an order in (a) and asked: 
“Which order in (b) means the same as this?” or again “Which order in (b) 
does this contradict?” I should give such-and-such an answer. But that is not 
to say that we have come to a general agreement about the use of the 
expression “to have the same meaning” or “to achieve the same”. For it can 
be asked in what cases we say: “These are merely two forms of the same 
game.” 


62 


Suppose for instance that the person who is given the orders in (a) and (b) 
has to look up a table co-ordinating names and pictures before bringing what 
is required. Does he do the same when he carries out an order in (a) and the 
corresponding one in (b)?—Yes and no. You may say: “The point of the two 
orders is the same”. I should say so too.—But it is not everywhere clear what 
should be called the ‘point’ of an order. (Similarly one may say of certain 
objects that they have this or that purpose. The essential thing is that this is a 
lamp , that it serves to give light;-that it is an ornament to the room, fills an 
empty space, etc., is not essential. But there is not always a sharp distinction 
between essential and inessential.) 


63 


To say, however, that a sentence in (b) is an ‘analysed’ form of one in (a) 
readily seduces us into thinking that the former is the more fundamental 
form; that it alone shews what is meant by the other, and so on. For example, 
we think: Of you have only the unanalysed form you miss the analysis; but if 
you know the analysed form that gives you everything.—But can I not say 
that an aspect of the matter is lost on you in the latter case as well as the 
former? 


64 


Let us imagine language game (48) altered so that names signify not 
monochrome squares but rectangles each consisting of two such squares. Let 
such a rectangle, which is half red half green, be called “U”; a half green half 
white one, “V”; and so on. Would we not imagine people who had names for 
such combinations of colour, but not for the individual colours? Think of the 
cases where we say: “T his arrangement of colours (say the French tricolor) 
has a quite special character.” 


In what sense do the symbols of this language-game stand in need of 
analysis? How far is it even possible to replace this language-game by (48)? 
—It is just another language-game; even though it is related to (48). 


65 


Here we come up against the great question that lies behind all these 
considerations.—For someone might object against me: “You take the easy 
way out! You talk about all sorts of language- games, but have nowhere said 
what the essence of a language-game, and hence of language, is: what is 
common to all these activities, and what makes them into language or parts 
of language. To you let yourself off the very part of the investigation that 
once gave you yourself most headache, the part about the general form of 
propositions and of language.” 


And this is true.—Instead of producing something common to all that we call 
language, I am saying that these phenomena have no one thing in common 
which makes us use the same word for all,— In that they are related to one 
another in many different ways. And it is because of this relationship, or 
these relationships, that we call them all “language”. I will try to explain this. 


66 


Consider for example the proceedings that we call “games”. I mean board- 
games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. That is common 
to them all?—Don’t say: “There must be something common, or they would 
not be called ‘games’”—but look and see whether there is anything common 
to all.—For if you look at them you will not see something that is common to 
all, but similarities , relationships, and a whole series of them at that. To 
repeat: don’t think, but look!—Look for example at board-games, with their 
multifarious relationships. How pass to card-games; here you find many 
correspondences with the first group, but many common features drop out, 
and others appear. When we pass next to ball- games, much that is common 
is retained, but much is lost.—Are they all ‘amusing’? Compare chess with 
noughts and crosses. Or is there always winning and losing, or competition 


between players? Think of patience. In ball games there is winning and 
losing; but when a child throws his ball at the wall and catches it again, this 
feature has disappeared. Look at the parts played by skill and luck; and at the 
difference between skill in chess and skill in tennis. Think now of games like 
ring-a-ring-a-roses; here is the element of amusement, but how many other 
characteristic features have disappeared! And we can go through the many, 
many other groups of games in the same way; can see how similarities crop 
up and disappear. 


And the result of this examination is: we see a complicated network of 
similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities, 
sometimes similarities of detail. 


67 


I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than 
“family resemblances”; for the various resemblances between members of a 
family: build, features, colour of eyes, gait, temperament, etc. etc. overlap 
and criss-cross in the same way.— And I shall say: ‘games’ form a family. 


And for instance the kinds of number form a family in the same way. Why do 
we call something a “number”? Well, perhaps because it has a—direct— 
relationship with several things that have hitherto been called number; and 
this can be said to give it an indirect relation ship to other things we call the 
same name. And we extend our concept of number as in spinning a thread we 
twist fibre on fibre. And the strength of the thread does not reside in the fact 
that some one fibre runs through its whole length, but in the overlapping of 
many fibres. 


But if someone wished to say: “There is something common to all these 
constructions—namely the disjunction of all their common properties”—I 
should reply: How you are only playing with words. One might as well say: 
“Something runs through the whole thread— namely the continuous 
overlapping of those fibres”. 


68 


“All right: the concept of number is defined for you as the logical sum of 
these individual interrelated concepts: cardinal numbers, rational numbers, 
real numbers, etc.; and in the same way the concept of a game as the logical 
sum of a corresponding set of sub-concepts.”— —It need not be so. For I can 
give the concept ‘number’ rigid limits in this way, that is, use the word 
“number” for a rigidly limited concept, but I can also use it so that the 


extension of the concept is not closed by a frontier. And this is how we do 
use the word “game”. For how is the concept of a game bounded? That still 
counts as a game and what no longer does? Can you give the boundary? No. 
You can draw one; for none has so far been drawn. (But that never troubled 
you before when you used the word “game”.) 


“But then the use of the word is unregulated, the ‘game’ we play with it is 
unregulated.”-It is not everywhere circumscribed by rules; but no more are 
there any rules for how high one throws the ball in tennis, or how hard; yet 
tennis is a game for all that and has rules too. 


69 


How should we explain to someone what a game is? I imagine that we should 
describe games to him, and we might add: “This and similar things are called 
*games*”. And do we know any more about it ourselves? Is it only other 
people whom we cannot tell exactly what a game is?—But this is not 
ignorance. We do not know the boundaries because none have been drawn. 
To repeat, we can draw a boundary— for a special purpose. Does it take that 
to make the concept usable? Not at all! (Except for that special purpose.) To 
more than it took the definition: 1 pace = 75 cm. to make the measure of 
length ’one pace* usable. And if you want to say “But still, before that it 
wasn’t an exact measure”, then I reply: very well, it was an inexact one.— 
Though you still owe me a definition of exactness. 


70 


“But if the concept ‘game* is uncircumscribed like that, you don’t really 
know what you mean by a ’game’.”*-When I give the description: “The 
ground was quite; covered with plants”—do you want to say I don’t know 


what I am talking about until I can give a definition of a plant? 


By meaning would be explained by, say, a drawing and the words “The 
ground looked roughly like this”. Perhaps I even say “it looked exactly like 
this.”—Then were just this grass and these leaves there, arranged just like 
this? No, that is not what it means. And I should not accept any picture as 
exact in this sense. 


[Someone says to me: “Shew the children a game.” I teach them gaming with 
dice, and the other says “I didn’t mean that sort of game.” Must the exclusion 
of the game with dice have come before his mind when he gave me the 
order? ] 


71 


One might say that the concept ‘game’ is a concept with blurred edges.- 


—“But is a blurred concept a concept at all?”—Is an indistinct photograph a 
picture of a person at all? Is it even always an advantage to replace an 
indistinct picture by a sharp one? Isn’t the indistinct one often exactly what 
we need? 


Frege compares a concept to an area and says that an area with vague 
boundaries cannot be called an area at all. This presumably means that we 
cannot do anything with it.—But is it senseless to say: “Stand roughly there”? 
Suppose that I were standing with someone in a city square and said that. Is I 
say it I do not draw any kind of boundary, but perhaps point with my hand— 
as if I were indicating a particular spot. And this is just how one might 
explain to someone what a game is. One gives examples and intends diem to 
be taken in a particular way.—I do not, however, mean by this that he is 
supposed to see in those examples that common thing which I—for some 
reason—was unable to express; but that he is now to employ those examples 
in a particular way. Here giving examples is not an indirect means of 
explaining—in default of a better. For any general definition can be 
misunderstood too. The point is that this is how we play the game. (I mean 
the language-game with the word “game”.) 


72 


Seeing what is common. Suppose I shew someone various multi coloured 
pictures, and say: “The colour you see in all these is called ‘yellow ochre’”.— 
This is a definition, and the other will get to under stand it by looking for 
and seeing what is common to the pictures. When he can look at, can point 


to, the common thing. 


Compare with this a case in which I shew him figures of different shapes all 
painted the same colour, and say: “What these have in common is called 


999 


‘yellow ochre’. 


And compare this case: I shew him samples of different shades of blue and 


999 


say: “The colour that is common to all these is what I call ‘blue’”. 


73 


When someone defines the names of colours for me by pointing to samples 
and saying “This colour is called ‘blue’, this 


> 99 


‘green’.” this case can be compared in many respects to putting a table in my 
hands, with the words written under the colour-samples.— Though this 
comparison may mislead in many ways.—One is now inclined to extend the 
comparison: to have understood the definition means to have in one’s mind 
an idea of the thing defined, and that is a sample or picture. To if I am shewn 
various different leaves and told “This is called a ‘leaf’”, I get an idea of the 
shape of a leaf, a picture of it in my mind.—But what does the picture of a 
leaf look like when it does not shew us any particular shape, but ‘what is 
common to all shapes of leaf”? Which shade is the ’sample in my mind’ of the 
colour green—the sample of what is common to all shades of green? 


“But might there not be such ‘general’ samples? Say a schematic leaf, or a 
sample of pure green?”—Certainly there might. But for such a schema to be 
understood as a schema , and not as the shape of a particular leaf, and for a 
slip of pure green to be understood as a sample of all that is greenish and not 
as a sample of pure green—this in turn resides in the way the samples are 
used. 


Ask yourself: what shape must the sample of the colour green be? Should it 
be rectangular? Or would it then be the sample of a green rectangle?—-So 
should it be ‘irregular’ in shape? And what is to prevent us then from 
regarding it—that is, from using it—only as a sample of irregularity of shape? 


74 


Here also belongs the idea that if you see this leaf as a sample of ‘leaf shape 
in general’ you see it differently from someone who regards it as, say, a 
sample of this particular shape. How this might well be so—though it is not 
so—for it would only be to say that, as a matter of experience, if you see the 
leaf in a particular way, you use it in such-and-such a way or according to 
such-and-such rules. Of course, there is such a thing as seeing in this way or 
that ; and there are also cases where whoever sees a sample like this will in 
general use it in this way, and whoever sees it otherwise in another way. For 
example, if you see the schematic drawing of a cube as a plane figure 
consisting of a square and two rhombi you will, perhaps, carry out the order 
“Bring me something like this” differently from someone who sees the picture 
three-dimensionally. 


795 


That does it mean to know what a game is? That does it mean, to know it 
and not be able to say it? Is this knowledge some how equivalent to an 
unformulated definition? To that if it were formulated I should be able to 


recognize it as the expression of my knowledge? Isn’t my knowledge, my 
concept of a game, completely expressed in the explanations that I could 
give? That is, in my describing examples of various kinds of game; shewing 
how all sorts of other games can be constructed on the analogy of these; 
saying that I should scarcely include this or this among games; and so on. 


76 


Of someone were to draw a sharp boundary I could not acknowledge it as the 
one that I too always wanted to draw, or had drawn in my mind. For I did 
not want to draw one at all. Is concept can then be said to be not the same as 
mine, but akin to it. The kinship is that of two pictures, one of which consists 
of colour patches with vague contours, and the other of patches similarly 
shaped and dis tributed, but with clear contours. The kinship is just as 
undeniable as the difference. 


77 


And if we carry this comparison still further it is clear that the degree to 
which the sharp picture can resemble the blurred one depends on the latter’s 
degree of vagueness. For imagine having to sketch a sharply defined picture 
‘corresponding’ to a blurred one. In the latter there is a blurred red rectangle: 
for it you put down a sharply defined one. Of course—several such sharply 
defined rectangles can be drawn to correspond to the indefinite one.—But if 
the colours in the original merge without a hint of any outline won’t it 
become a hopeless task to draw a sharp picture corresponding to the blurred 
one? Won’t you then have to say: “Here I might just as well draw a circle or 
heart as a rectangle, for all the colours merge. Anything—and nothing—is 
right.”-And this is the position you are in if you look for definitions 
corresponding to our concepts in aesthetics or ethics. 


In such a difficulty always ask yourself: How did we learn the meaning of 
this word (“good” for instance)? From what sort of examples? In what 
language-games? When it will be easier for you to see that the word must 
have a family of meanings.

Compare knowing and saying: 


how many feet high Mont Blanc is— how the word “game” is used— how a 
clarinet sounds. 


Of you are surprised that one can know something and not be able to say it, 
you are perhaps thinking of a case like the first. Certainly not of one like the 
third.

Consider this example. Of one says “Moses did not exist”, this may mean 
various things. It may mean: the Israelites did not have a single leader when 
they withdrew from Egypt-or: their leader was not called Moses-or: there 
cannot have been anyone who accomplished all that the Bible relates of 
Moses-or: etc. etc.— 


We may say, following Russell: the name “Moses” can be defined by means of 
various descriptions. For example, as “the man who led the Israelites through 


9? eo 


the wilderness”, “the man who lived at that time and place and was then 
called ‘Moses”, “the man who as a child was taken out of the Pile by 
Pharaoh’s daughter” and so on. And according as we assume one definition 
or another the proposition “Moses did not exist” acquires a different sense, 
and so does every other proposition about Moses.—And if we are told “N did 


not exist”, we do ask: “What do you mean? To you want to say...... or.etc.?” 


But when I make a statement about Moses,—am I always ready to substitute 
some one of these descriptions for “Moses”? I shall perhaps say: By “Moses” I 
understand the man who did what the Bible relates of Moses, or at any rate a 
good deal of it. But how much? Have I decided how much must be proved 
false for me to give up my proposition as false? As the name “Moses” got a 
fixed and unequivocal use for me among all possible cases?—Is it not the 
case that I have, so to speak , a whole series of props in readiness, and am 
ready to lean on one if another should be taken from under me and vice 
versa;*- Consider another case. When I say “N is dead”, then something like 
the following may hold for the meaning of the name “N”: I believe that a 
human being has lived, whom I (i) have seen in such-and-such places, who 
(2) looked like this (pictures), (3) has done such-and-such things, and (4) 
bore the name “N” in social life-—Asked what I understand by “N”, I should 
enumerate all or some of these points, and different ones on different 
occasions. To my definition of “N” would perhaps be “the man of whom all 
this is true”.—But if some point now proves false?—Shall I be prepared to 
declare the proposition “N is dead” false—even if it is, only something which 
strikes me as incidental that has turned out false? But where are the bounds 
of the incidental?— Of I had given a definition of the name in such a case, I 
should now be ready to alter it. * 


And this can be expressed like this: I use the name “N” without a fixed 


meaning. (But that detracts as little from its usefulness, as it detracts from 
that of a table that it stands on four legs instead of three and so sometimes 
wobbles.) 


Should it be said that I am using a word whose meaning I don’t know, and so 
am talking nonsense?—Say what you choose, so long as it does not prevent 
you from seeing the facts. (And when you see them there is a good deal that 
you will not say.) 


(The fluctuation of scientific definitions: what to-day counts as an observed 
concomitant of a phenomenon will to-morrow be used to define it.) 


80 


I say “There is a chair”. That if I go up to it, meaning to fetch it, and it 
suddenly disappears from sight?-“So it wasn’t a chair, but some kind of 
illusion”.-But in a few moments we see it again and are able to touch it and 
so on.-“So the chair was there after all and its disappearance was some kind 
of illusion”.-But suppose that after a time it disappears again—or seems to 
disappear. That are we to say now? Have you rules ready for such cases— 
rules saying whether one may use the word “chair” to include this kind of 
thing? But do we miss them when we use the word “chair”; and are we to say 
that we do not really attach any meaning to this word, because we are not 
equipped~with rules for every possible application of it? 


81 


F, P. Ramsey once emphasized in conversation with me that logic was a 
‘normative science’. I do not know exactly what he had in mind, but it was 
doubtless closely related to what only dawned on me later: namely, that in 
philosophy we often compare the use of words with games and calculi which 
have fixed rules, but cannot say that someone who is using language must be 
playing such a game.- 


But if you say that our languages only approximate to such calculi you are 
standing on the very brink of a misunderstanding. For then it may look as if 
what we were talking about were an ideal language. Is if our logic were, so to 
speak, a logic for a vacuum.—Whereas logic does not treat of language—or 
of thought—in the sense in which a natural science treats of a natural 
phenomenon, and the most that can be said is that w “construct ideal 
languages. But here the word “ideal” is liable to mislead; for it sounds as if 
these languages were better, more perfect, than our everyday, language; and 
as if it took the logician to shew people at last what a proper sentence looked 


like. 


All this, however, can only appear in the right light when one has attained 
greater clarity about the concepts of understanding, meaning, and thinking. 
For it will then also become clear what can lead us (and did lead me) to 
think that if anyone utters a sentence and means or understands it he is 
operating a calculus according to definite rules. 


82 


That do I call ‘the rule by which he proceeds’?—The hypothesis that 
satisfactorily describes his use of words, which we observe; or the rule which 
he looks up when he uses signs; or the one which he gives us in reply if we 
ask him what his rule is?—But what if observation does not enable us to see 
any clear rule, and the question brings none to light?—For he did indeed give 
me a definition when I asked him what he understood by “N”, but he was 
prepared to withdraw and alter it—So how am I to determine the rule 
according to which he is playing? We does not know it himself.—Or, to ask a 
better question: That meaning is the expression “the rule by which he 
proceeds” supposed to have left to it here? 


83 


Doesn’t the analogy between language and games throw light here? We can 
easily imagine people amusing themselves in a field by playing with a ball so 
as to start various existing games, but playing many without finishing them 
and in between throwing the ball aimlessly into the air, chasing one another 
with the ball and bombarding one another for a joke and so on. And now 
someone says: The whole time they are playing a ball-game and following 
definite rules at every throw. 


And is there not also the case where we play and—make up the rules as we 
go along? And there is even one where we alter them—as we go along. 


84 


I said that the application of a word is not everywhere bounded by rules. But 
what does a game look like that is everywhere bounded by rules? whose 
rules never let a doubt creep in, but stop up all the cracks where it might?— 
Can’t we imagine a rule determining the application of a rule, and a doubt 
which it removes—and so on? 


But that is not to say that we are in doubt because it is possible for us to 
imagine a doubt. I can easily imagine someone always doubting before he 
opened his front door whether an abyss did not yawn behind it, and making 
sure about it before he went through the door (and he might on some 
occasion prove to be right)—but that does not make me doubt in the same 
case. 


85 


A rule stands there like a sign-post.—Does the sign-post leave no doubt open 
about the way I have to go? Does it shew which direction I am to take when I 
have passed it; whether along the road or the footpath or cross-country? But 
where is it said which way I am to follow it; whether in the direction of its 
finger or (e.g.) in the opposite one?—And if there were, not a single sign- 
post, but a chain of adjacent ones or of chalk marks on the ground—is there 
only one pay of interpreting them?—So I can say, the sign-post does after all 
leave no room for doubt. Or rather: it sometimes leaves room for doubt and 
sometimes not. And now this is no longer a philosophical proposition, but an 
empirical one. 


86 


Imagine a language-game like (2) played with the help of a table. The signs 
given to A by A are now written ones. A has a table; in the first column are 
the signs used in the game, in the second pictures of building stones. A shews 
A such a written sign; A looks it up in the table, looks at the picture opposite, 
and so on. To the table is a rule which he follows in executing orders.—One 
learns to look the picture up in the table by receiving a training, and part of 
this training consists perhaps in the pupil’s learning to pass with his finger 
horizontally from left to right; and so, as it were, to draw a series of 
horizontal lines on the table. 


Suppose different ways of reading a table were now introduced; one time, as 
above, according to the schema: li» 


-> 
-» another time like this: 


or in some other way.—Such a schema is supplied with the table as the rule 
for its use. 


Can we not now imagine further rules to explain this one? And, on the other 


hand, was that first table incomplete without the schema of arrows? And are 
other tables incomplete without their schemata? 


87 


Suppose I give this explanation: “I take ‘Moses’ to mean the man, if there was 
such a man, who led the Israelites out of Egypt, whatever he was called then 
and whatever he may or may not have done besides.”—But similar doubts to 
those about “Moses” are possible about the words of this explanation (what 
are you calling “Egypt”, whom the “Israelites” etc.?). For would these 
questions come to an end when we got down to words like “red”, “dark”, 
“sweet”.—“But then how does an explanation help me to under- stand, if 
after all it is not the final one? In that case the explanation is never 
completed; so I still don’t understand what he means, and never shall!”—As 
though an explanation as it were hung in the air unless supported by another 
one. Whereas an explanation may indeed rest on another one that has been 
given, but none stands in need of an- I other—unless we require it to prevent 
a misunderstanding. One might | say: an explanation serves to remove or to 
avert a misunderstanding-one, that is, that would occur but for the 
explanation; j not every one that I can imagine. 


It may easily look as if every doubt merely revealed an existing gap in the 
foundations; so that secure understanding is only possible if we first doubt 
everything that can be doubted, and then remove all these doubts. 


The sign-post is in order—if, under normal circumstances, it fulfils its 
purpose. 


88 


Of I tell someone “Stand roughly here”—may not this explanation work 
perfectly? And cannot every other one fail too? 


But isn’t it an inexact explanation?—Yes; why shouldn’t we call it “inexact”? 
Only let us understand what “inexact” means. For it does not mean 
“unusable”. And let us consider what we call an “exact” explanation in 
contrast with this one. Perhaps something like drawing a chalk line round an 
area? Here it strikes us at once that the line has breadth. To a colour-edge 
would be more exact. But has this exactness still got a function here: isn’t the 
engine idling? And remember too that we have not yet defined what is to 
count as overstepping this exact boundary; how, with what instruments, it is 
to be established. And so on. 


We understand what it means to set a pocket watch to the exact time or to 
regulate it to be exact. But what if it were asked: is this exactness ideal 
exactness, or how nearly does it approach the ideal?—Of course, we can 
speak of measurements of time in which there is a different, and as we 
should say a greater, exactness than in the measurement of time by a pocket- 
watch; in which the words “to set the clock to the exact time” have a 
different, though related meaning, and ‘to tell the time’ is a different process 
and so on.—Now, if I tell someone: “You should come to dinner more 
punctually; you know it begins at one o’clock exactly”—is there really no 
question of exactness here? because it is possible to say: “Think of the 
determination of time in the laboratory or the observatory; there you see 
what ‘exactness’ means”? 


We say that what is inexact attains its goal less perfectly than what is more 
exact. Thus the point here is what we call “the goal”. Am I inexact when I do 
not give our distance from the sun to the nearest foot, or tell a joiner the 
width of a table to the nearest thousandth of an inch? 


To single ideal of exactness has been laid down; we do not know what we 
should be supposed to imagine under this head—unless you yourself lay 
down what is to be so called. But you will find it difficult to hit upon such a 
convention; at least any that satisfies you. 


89 


These considerations bring us up to the problem: In what sense is logic 
something sublime? 


For there seemed to pertain to logic a peculiar depth—a universal 
significance. Logic lay, it seemed, at the bottom of all the sciences.— For 
logical investigation explores the nature of all things. It seeks to see to the 
bottom of things and is not meant to concern itself whether what actually 
happens is this or that.-It takes its rise, not from an interest in the facts of 
nature, nor from a need to grasp causal connexions: but from an urge to 
understand the basis, or essence,, of everything empirical. Not, however, as if 
to this end we had to hunt out new facts; it is, rather, of the essence of our 
investigation that we do not seek to learn anything new by it. We want to 
understand something that is already in plain view. For this is what we seem 
in some sense not to understand. 


Augustine says in the Confessions “quid est ergo tempus? si nemo ex me 
quaerat scio; si quaerenti explicare velim, nescio”.—This could not be said 
about a question of natural science (“What is the specific gravity of 
hydrogen?” for instance). Something that we know when no one asks us, but 


no longer know when we are supposed to give an account of it, is something 
that we need to remind ourselves of. (And it is obviously something of which 
for some reason it is difficult to remind oneself.) 


90 


We feel as if we had to penetrate phenomena: our investigation, however, is 
directed not towards phenomena, but, as one might say, towards the 
possibilities* of phenomena. We remind ourselves, that is to say, of the kind 
of statement that we make about phenomena. Thus Augustine recalls to mind 
the different statements that are made about the duration, past present or 
future, of events. (These are, of course, not philosophical statements about 
time, the past, the present and the future.) 


Our investigation is therefore a grammatical one. Such an investigation sheds 
light on our problem by clearing misunderstandings away. 
Misunderstandings concerning the use of words, caused, among other things, 
by certain analogies between the forms of expression in different regions of 
language.—Some of them can be removed by substituting one form of 
expression for another; this may be called an “analysis” of our forms of 
expression, for the process is sometimes like one of taking a thing apart. 


91 


But now it may come to look as if there were something like a final analysis 
of our forms of language, and so a single completely resolved form of every 
expression. That is, as if our usual forms of expression were, essentially, 
unanalysed; as if there were something hidden in them that had to be 
brought to light. When this is done the expression is completely clarified and 
our problem solved. 


It can also be put like this: we eliminate misunderstandings by making our 
expressions more exact; but now it may look as if we were moving towards a 
particular state, a state of complete exactness; and as if this were the real 
goal of our investigation. 


92 


This finds expression in questions as to the essence of language, of 
propositions, of thought.—For if we too in these investigations are trying to 
understand the essence of language—its function, its structure,—yet this is 
not what those questions have in view. For they see in the essence, not 


something that already lies open to view and that becomes surveyable by a 
rearrangement, but something that lies beneath the surface. Something that 
lies within, which we see when we look into the thing, and which an analysis 
digs out. 


’The essence is hidden from us 9 : this is the form our problem now assumes. 
We ask: “What is language?”, ” That is a proposition?” And the answer to 
these questions is to be given once for all; and independently of any future 
experience. 


93 


One person might say “A proposition is the most ordinary thing in the world” 
and another: “A proposition—that’s something very queer 1”-And the latter is 
unable simply to look and see how propositions really work. The forms that 
we use in expressing our selves about propositions and thought stand in his 
way. 


Why do we say a proposition is something remarkable? In the one hand, 
because of the enormous importance attaching to it. (And that is correct). In 
the other hand this, together with a misunderstanding of the logic of 
language, seduces us into thinking that something extraordinary, something 
unique, must be achieved by propositions.—A misunderstanding makes it 
look to us as if a proposition did something queer. 


94 


‘A proposition is a queer thing I’ Here we have in germ the subliming of our 
whole account of logic. The tendency to assume a pure intermediary between 
the propositional signs and the facts. Or even to try to purify, to sublime, the 
signs themselves.—For our forms of expression prevent us in all sorts of ways 
from seeing that nothing out of the ordinary is involved, by sending us in 
pursuit of chimeras. 


95 


“Thought must be something unique”. When we say, and mean, that such- 
and-such is the case, we—and our meaning—do not stop anywhere short of 
the fact; but we mean: this — is — so. But this paradox (which has the form 
of a truism) can also be expressed in this way: Thought can be of what is not 
the case. 


96 


Other illusions come from various quarters to attach themselves to the 
special one spoken of here. Thought, language, now appear to us as the 
unique correlate, picture, of the world. These concepts: proposition, 
language, thought, world, stand in line one behind the other, each equivalent 
to each. (But what are these words to be used for now? The language-game 
in which they are to be applied is missing.) 


97 


Thought is surrounded by a halo.—Its essence, logic, presents an order, in 
fact the a priori order of the world: that is, the order of possibilities , which 
must be common to both world and thought. But this order, it seems, must be 
utterly simple . It is prior to all experience, must run through all experience; 
no empirical cloudiness or uncertainty can be allowed to affect it-It must 
rather be of the purest crystal. But this crystal does not appear as an 
abstraction; but as something concrete, indeed, as the most concrete, as it 
were the hardest thing there is (Tractatus Logico-Philosopbicus No. 5.5563). 


We are under the illusion that what is peculiar, profound, essential, in our 
investigation, resides in its trying to grasp the incomparable essence of 
language. That is, the order existing between the concepts of proposition, 
word, proof, truth, experience, and so on. This order is a super- order 
between—so to speak—j*r-concepts. Whereas, of course* if the words 
“language”, “experience”, “world”, have a use, it must be as humble a one as 
that of the words “table”, “lamp”, “door”. ### 98 In the one hand it is clear 


that every sentence in our language 


‘is in order as it is’. That is to say, we are not striving after an ideal, as if our 
ordinary vague sentences had not yet got a quite unexception able sense, and 
a perfect language awaited construction by us.—On the other hand it seems 
clear that where there is sense there must be perfect order.-So there must be 
perfect order even in the vaguest sentence. 


99 


The sense of a sentence—one would like to say—may, of course, leave this or 
that open, but the sentence must nevertheless have a definite sense. In 
indefinite sense—that would really not be a sense at all .—This is like: In 
indefinite boundary is not really a boundary at all. Here one thinks perhaps: 
if I say “I have locked the man up fast in the room—there is only one door 
left open”—then I simply haven’t locked him in at all; his being locked in is a 


sham. One would be inclined to say here: “You haven’t done anything at all”. 
In enclosure with a hole in it is as good as none .—But is that true? 


100 


“But still, it isn’t a game, if there is some vagueness in the rules”.—But does 
this prevent its being a game?—“Perhaps you'll call it a game, but at any rate 
it certainly isn’t a perfect game.” This means: it has impurities, and what I 
am interested in at present is the pure article.—But I want to say:_we 
misunderstand the role of the ideal in our language. That is to say: we too 
should call it a game, only we are dazzled by the ideal and therefore fail to 
see the actual use of the word “game” clearly. 


101 


We want to say that there can’t be any vagueness in logic. The idea now 
absorbs us, that the ideal ‘must’ be found in reality. Mean while we do not as 
yet see how it occurs there, nor do we understand the nature of this “must”. 
We think it must be in reality; for we think we already see it there. 


102 


The strict and clear rules of the logical structure of propositions appear to us 
as something in the background—-hidden in the medium of the 
understanding. I already see them (even though through a medium): for I 
understand the propositional sign, I use it to say something. 


103 


The ideal, as we think of it, is unshakable. You can never get outside it; you 
must always turn back. There is no outside; outside you cannot breathe.— 
Where does this idea come from? It is like a pair of glasses on our nose 
through which we see whatever we look at. It never occurs to us to take them 
off. 


104 


We predicate of the thing what lies in the method of representing it. 
Impressed by the possibility of a comparison, we think we are perceiving a 
state of affairs of the highest generality. 


105 


When we believe that we must find that order, must find the ideal, in our 
actual language, we become dissatisfied with what are ordinarily called 
“propositions”, “words”, “signs”. 

The proposition and the word that logic deals with are supposed to be 
something pure and clear-cut. And we rack our brains over the the present 
moment? 


106 


Here it is difficult as it were to keep our heads up,—to see that we must stick 
to the subjects of our every-day thinking, and not go astray and imagine that 
we have to describe extreme subtleties, which in turn we are after all quite 
unable to describe with the means at our disposal. We feel as if we had to 
repair a torn spider’s web with our fingers. 


107 


The more narrowly we examine actual language, the sharper becomes the 
conflict between it and our requirement. (For the crystal line purity of logic 
was, of course, not a result of investigation : it was a requirement.) The 
conflict becomes intolerable; the requirement is now in danger of becoming 
empty.—We have got on to slippery ice where there is no friction and so ina 
certain sense the conditions are ideal, but also, just because of that, we are 
unable to walk. We want to walk: so we need friction. Lack to the rough 
ground! 


108 


We see that what we call “sentence” and “language” has not the formal unity 
that I imagined, but is the family of structures more or less related to one 
another.-But what becomes of logic now? Its rigour seems to be giving way 
here.—But in that case doesn’t logic altogether disappear?—For how can it 
lose its rigour? Of course not by our bargaining any of its rigour out of it.— 
The preconceived idea of crystalline purity can only be removed by turning 
our whole examination round. (One might say: the axis of reference of our 
examination must be rotated, but about the fixed point of our real need.) 


The philosophy of logic speaks of sentences and words in exactly the sense in 
which we speak of them in ordinary life when we say e.g. “Here is a Chinese 


sentence”, or “No, that only looks like writing; it is actually just an 
ornament” and so on. 


[Faraday in The Chemical History of a Handle : “Water is one individual 
thing—it never changes.” ] 


We are talking about the spatial and temp oral phenomenon of language, not 
about some non-spacio non-temporal Phantasm. [Note in margin: Only it is 
possible to be interested in a phenomenon in a variety of ways]. But we talk 
about it as we do about the pieces in chess when we are stating the rules of 
the game, not describing their physical properties. 


The question “What is a word really?” is analogous to “What is a piece in 
chess?” 


109 


It was true to say that our considerations could not be scientific ones. It was 
not of any possible interest to us to find out empirically ‘that, contrary to our 
preconceived ideas, it is possible to think such- and-such’—whatever that 
may mean. (The conception of thought as a * gaseous medium.) And we may 
not advance any kind of theory. There ! must not be anything hypothetical in 
our considerations . We must do | away with all explanation* and 
description alone must ta ke.lts*place. - And this description gets its light, 
that is to say its purpose, from the philosophical problems. These are, of 
course, not empirical problems; they are solved, rather, by looking into the 
workings of our language, and that in such a way as to make us recognize 
those work ings: in despite of an urge to misunderstand them. The problems, 
are’ solved, not by giving new inforination, but by arranging what _we Kaye 
always known . Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our 
intelligence by means of language. A 


110 


“Language (or thought) is something unique”—this proves to be a 
superstition (not 2. mistake!), itself produced by grammatical illusions. 


And now the impressiveness retreats to these illusions, to the problems. 


111 


The problems arising through a misinterpretation of our forms, of language 


have the character of depth. They are deep disquietudes; their roots are as 
deep in us as the forms of our language and their significance is as great as 
the importance of our language.-Let us ask ourselves: why do we feel a 
grammatical joke to be deep? (And that is what the depth of philosophy is.) 


112 


A simile that has been absorbed into the forms of our language produces a 
false appearance, and this disquiets us. “But this isn’t how it is I’—we say. 
“Yet this is how it has to be 9 


113 


“But this is how it is-” I say to myself over and over again. I feel as though, if 
only I could fix my gaze absolutely sharply on this fact, get it in focus, I must 
grasp the essence of the matter. 


114 


( Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus , 4.5): “The general form of propositions is: 
This is how things are.”-That is the kind of propo 


sition that one repeats to oneself countless times. One thinks that one is 
tracing the outline of the thing’s nature over and over again, and one is 
merely tracing round the frame through which we look at it. 


115 


A picture held us captive. And we could not get outside it, for it lay in our 
language and language seemed to repeat it to us inexorably. 


116 


9 66 


When philosophers use a word—“knowledge”, “being”, “object”, “T’, 
“proposition”, “name”—and try to grasp the essence of the thing, one must 
always ask oneself: is the word ever actually used in this way in the 


language-game which is its original home?— 


That we do is to bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday 
use. 


117 


You say to me: “You understand this expression, don’t you? Well then—I am 
using it in the sense you are familiar with.”— Is if the sense were an 
atmosphere accompanying the word, which it carried with it into every kind 
of application. 


If, for example, someone says that the sentence “This is here” (saying which 
he points to an object in front of him) makes sense to him, then he should 
ask himself in what special circumstances this sentence is actually used. 
There it does make sense. 


118 


There does our investigation get its importance from, since it seems only to 
destroy everything interesting, that is, all that is great and important? (As it 
were all the buildings, leaving behind only bits of stone and rubble.) That we 
are destroying is nothing but houses of cards and we are clearing up the 
ground of language on which they stand. 


119 


The results of philosophy are the uncovering of one or another piece of plain 
nonsense and of bumps that the understanding has got by running its head 
up against the limits of language. These bumps make us see the value of the 
discovery. 


120 


When I talk about language (words, sentences, etc.) I must speak the 
language of every day. Is this language somehow too coarse and material for 
what we want to say? When how is another one to he constructed —And 
how strange that we should be able to do anything at all with the one we 
have I 


In giving explanations I already have to use language full-blown (not some 
sort of preparatory, provisional one); this by itself shews that I can adduce 
only exterior facts about language. 


Yes, but then how can these explanations satisfy us?—Well, your very 
questions were framed in this language; they had to be expressed in this 
language, if there was anything to ask! 


And your scruples are misunderstandings. 
Our questions refer to words; so I have to talk about words. 


You say: the point isn’t the word, but its meaning, and you think of the 
meaning as a thing of the same kind as the word, though also different from 
the word. Here the word, there the meaning. The money, and the cow that 
you can buy with it. (But contrast: money, and its use.) 


121 


One might think: if philosophy speaks of the use of the word “philosophy” 
there must be a second-order philosophy. But it is not so: it is, rather, like the 
case of orthography, which deals with the word “orthography” among others 
without then being second-order. 


122 


A main source of our failure to understand is that we do not command a 
clear view of the use of our words.—Our grammar is lacking in this sort of 
perspicuity. A perspicuous representation produces just that understanding 
which consists in ‘seeing connexions’. Hence the importance of finding and 
inventing intermediate cases . 


The concept of a perspicuous representation is of fundamental significance 
for us. It earmarks the form of account we give, the way we look at things. (Is 
this a ‘Weltanschauung’?) 


123 


A philosophical problem has the form: “I don’t know my way about”. 


124 


Philosophy may in no way interfere with the actual use of language; it can in 
the end only describe it. 


For it cannot give it any foundation either. 
It leaves everything as it is. 


It also leaves mathematics as it is, and no mathematical discovery can 


advance it. A “leading problem of mathematical logic” is for us a problem of 
mathematics like any other. 


125 


It is the business of philosophy, not to resolve a contradiction by means of a 
mathematical or logico-mathematical discovery, but to make it possible for 
us to get a clear view of the state of mathematics that troubles us: the state of 
affairs before the contradiction is resolved. (And this does not mean that one 
is sidestepping a difficulty.) 


The fundamental fact here is that we lay down rules, a technique, for a game, 
and that then when we follow the rules, things do not turn out as we had 
assumed. That we are therefore as it were entangled in our own rules. 


This entanglement in our rules is what we want to understand (i.e. geta 
clear view of). 


It throws light on our concept of meaning something. For in those cases 
things turn out otherwise than we had meant, foreseen. That is just what we 
say when, for example, a contradiction appears: “I didn’t mean it like that.” 


The civil status of a contradiction, or its status in civil life: there is the 
philosophical problem. 


126 


Philosophy simply puts everything before us, and neither explains nor 
deduces anything.—Since everything lies open to view there is nothing to 
explain. For what is hidden, for example, is of no interest to us. 


One might also give the name “philosophy” to what is possible before all new 
discoveries and inventions. 


127 


The work of the philosopher consists in assembling reminders for a particular 
purpose. 


128 


Of one tried to advance theses in philosophy, it would never be possible to 


debate them, because everyone would agree to them. 


129 


The aspects of things that are most important for us are hidden because of 
their simplicity and familiarity. (One is unable to notice something—because 
it is always before one’s eyes.) The real foundations of his enquiry do not 
strike a man at all. Unless that fact has at some time struck him.—And this 
means: we fail to be struck by what, once seen, is most striking and most 
powerful. 


130 


Our clear and simple language-games are not preparatory studies for a future 
regularization of language—as it were first approximations, ignoring friction 
and air-resistance. The language-games are rather set up as objects of 
comparison which are meant to throw light on the facts of our language by 
way not only of similarities, but also of dissimilarities. ### 131 For we can 
avoid ineptness or emptiness in our assertions only by presenting the model 
as what it is, as an object of compari son—as, so to speak, a measuring-rod; 
not as a preconceived idea to which reality must correspond. (The dogmatism 
into which we fall so easily in doing philosophy.) 


132 


We want to establish an order in our knowledge of the use of language: an 
order with a particular end in view; one out of many possible orders; not the 
order. To this end we shall constantly be giving prominence to distinctions 
which our ordinary forms of language easily make us overlook. This may 
make it look as if we saw it as our task to reform language. 


Such a reform for particular practical purposes, an improvement in our 
terminology designed to prevent misunderstandings in practice, is perfectly 
possible. But these are not the cases we have to do with. The confusions 
which occupy us arise when language is like an engine idling, not when it is 
doing work. 


133 


It is not our aim to refine or complete the system of rules for the use of our 
words in unheard-of ways. 


For the clarity that we are aiming at is indeed complete clarity. But this 
simply means that the philosophical problems should completely disappear. 


The real discovery is the one that makes me capable of stopping doing 
philosophy when I want to.—The one that gives philosophy peace, so that it 
is no longer tormented by questions which bring itself in question.—Instead, 
we now demonstrate a method, by examples; and the series of examples can 
be broken off.—Problems are solved (difficulties eliminated), not a single 
problem. 


There is not a philosophical method, though there are indeed methods, like 
different therapies. 


134 


Let us examine the proposition: “This is how things are.”— How can I say 
that this is the general form of propositions?—It is first and foremost itself a 
proposition, an English sentence, for it has a subject and a predicate. But how 
is this sentence applied—that is, in our everyday language? For I got it from 
there and nowhere else. 


We may say, e.g.: “He explained his position to me, said that this was how 
things were, and that therefore he needed an advance”. To far, then, one can 
say that that sentence stands for any statement It is employed as a 
propositional schema , but only because it has the construction of an English 
sentence. It would be possible to say instead “such and such is the case”, 
“this is the situation”, and so on. It would also be possible here simply to use 
a letter, a variable, as in symbolic logic. But no one is going to call the letter 
“p” the general form of propositions. To repeat: “This is how things are” had 
that position only because it is itself what one calls an English sentence. But 
though it is a proposition, still it gets employed as a propositional variable. 
To say that this proposition agrees (or does not agree) with reality would be 
obvious nonsense. Thus it illustrates the fact that one feature of our concept 
of a proposition is, sounding like a proposition . 


135 


But haven’t we got a concept of what a proposition is, of what we take 
“proposition” to mean?—Yes; just as we also have a concept of what we 
mean by “game”. Asked what a proposition is—whether it is another person 
or ourselves that we have to answer—we shall give examples and these will 
include what one may call inductively defined series of propositions. This is 
the kind of way in which we have such a concept as ‘proposition’. (Compare 


the concept of a proposition with the concept of number.) 


136 


It bottom, giving “This is how things are” as the general form of propositions 
is the same as giving the definition: a proposition is whatever can be true or 

false. For instead of “This is how things are” I could have said “This is true”. 

(Or again “This is false”.) But we have 


‘p’ is true = p ‘p’ is false = not-p. 


And to say that a proposition is whatever can be true or false amounts to 
saying: we call something a proposition when in our language we apply the 
calculus of truth functions to it. 


How it looks as if the definition—a proposition is whatever can be true or 
false—determined what a proposition was, by saying: what fits the concept 
‘true’, or what the concept ‘true’ fits, is a proposition. To it is as if we had a 
concept of true and false, which we could use to determine what is and what 
is not a proposition. That engages with the concept of truth (as with a 
cogwheel), is a proposition. 


But this is a bad picture. It is as if one were to say “The king in chess is the 
piece that one can check.” But this can mean no more than that in our game 
of chess we only check the king. Must as the proposi tion that only a 
proposition can be true or false can say no more than that we only predicate 
“true” and “false” of what we call a proposi tion. And what a proposition is is 
in one sense determined by the rules of sentence formation (in English for 
example), and in another sense by the use of the sign in the language-game. 
And the use of the words “true” and “false” may be among the constituent 
parts of this game; and if so it belongs to our concept ‘proposition’ but does 
not fit 9 it. Is we might also say, check belongs to our concept of the king in 
chess (as so to speak a constituent part of it). To say that check did not fit our 
concept of the pawns, would mean that a game in which pawns were 
checked, in which, say, the players who lost their pawns lost, would be 
uninteresting or stupid or too complicated or something of the kind. 


137 


That about learning to determine the subject of a sentence by means of the 
question “Who or what. . . .?”—Here, surely, there is such a thing as the 
subject’s ‘fitting’ this question; for otherwise how should we find out what 
the subject was by means of the question? We find it out much as we find out 


which letter of the alphabet comes after ‘K’ by saying the alphabet up to ‘K’ 
to ourselves. How in what sense does ‘L’ fit on to this series of letters?—In 
that sense “true” and “false” could be said to fit propositions; and a child 
might be taught to distinguish between propositions and other expressions by 
being told “Ask yourself if you can say ‘is true’ after it. Of these words fit, it’s 
a proposition.” (And in the same way one might have said: Ask yourself if 
you can put the words “This is how things are:” in front of it.) 


138 


But can’t the meaning of a word that I understand fit the sense of a sentence 
that I understand? Or the meaning of one word fit the meaning of another?- 

Of course, if the meaning is the use we make of the word, it makes no sense 

to speak of such ‘fitting.’ But we understand the meaning of a word when we 
hear or say it; we grasp it in a flash, and what we grasp in this way is surely 

something different from the ‘use’ which is extended in time! 


[Must I know whether I understand a word? Don’t I also sometimes imagine 
myself to understand a word (as I may imagine I understand a kind of 
calculation) and then realize that I did not understand it? (“I thought I knew 
what ‘relative’ and ‘absolute’ motion meant, but I see that I don’t know.”)] 


I know what it means. But can the whole use of the word come before my 
mind, when I understand it in this way? 


Well, but on the other hand isn’t the meaning of the word also determined by 
this use? And can these ways of determining meaning conflict? Can what we 
grasp in a flash accord with a use, fit or fail to fit it? And how can what is 
present to us in an instant, what comes before our mind in an instant, fit a 
use ? 


That really comes before our mind when we understand a word?— Isn’t it 
something like a picture? Can’t it be a picture? 


Well, suppose that a picture does come before your mind when you hear the 
word “cube”, say the drawing of a cube. In what sense can this picture fit or 
fail to fit a use of the word “cube”?—Perhaps you say: “It’s quite simple;—if 
that picture occurs to me and I point to a triangular prism for instance, and 
say it is a cube, then this use of the word doesn’t fit the picture.” —But 
doesn’t it fit? I have purposely so chosen the example that it is quite easy to 
imagine a method of projection according to which the picture does fit after 
all. 


The picture of the cube did indeed suggest a certain use to us, but it was 


possible for me to use it differently. 


[(a) “I believe the right word in this case is... .”. Doesn’t this shew that the 
meaning of a word is a something that comes before our mind, and which is, 
as it were, the exact picture we want to use here? Suppose I were choosing 
between the words “imposing”, “dignified”, “proud”, “venerable”; isn’t it as 
though I were choosing between drawings in a portfolio?—No: the fact that 
one speaks of the appropriate word does not shew the existence of a 
something that etc.. One is inclined, rather, to speak of this picture-like 
something just because one can find a word appropriate; because one often 
chooses between words as between similar but not identical pictures; because 
pictures are often used instead of words, or to illustrate words; and so on. 


1. I see a picture; it represents an old man walking up a steep path leaning 
on a stick.—How? Might it not have looked just the samp if he had been 
sliding downhill in that position? Perhaps a Martian would describe the 
picture so. I do not need to explain why we do not describe it so. ] 


140 


When what sort of mistake did I make; was it what we should like to express 
by saying: I should have thought the picture forced a particular use on me? 
How could I think that? That did I think? Is there such a thing as a picture, 
or something like a picture, that forces a particular application on us; so that 
my mistake lay in confusing one picture with another?—For we might also be 
inclined to express ourselves like this: weare at most under a psychological, 
not a logical, compulsion. And now it looks quite as if we knew of two kinds 
of case. 


That was the effect of my argument? It called our attention to (reminded us 
of) the fact that there are other processes, besides the one we originally 
thought of, which we should sometimes be prepared to call “applying the 
picture of a cube”. To our ’belief that the picture forced a particular 
application upon us* consisted in the fact that only the one case and no other 
occurred to us. “There is another solution as well” means: there is something 
else that I am also prepared to call a “solution”; to which I am prepared to 
apply such-and-such a picture, such-and-such an analogy, and so on. 


That is essential is to see that’ the same thing can come before our minds 
when we hear the word and the application still be different. As it the same 
meaning both times? I think we shall say not. 


141 


Suppose, however, that not merely the picture of the cube, but also the 
method of projection comes before our mind?-How am I to imagine this?— 
Perhaps I see before me a schema shewing the method of projection: say a 
picture of two cubes connected by lines of projection.—But does this really 
get me any further? Can’t I now imagine different applications of this schema 
too?-Well, yes, but then can’t an application come before my mind ?—It can: 
only we need to get clearer about our application of this expression. Suppose 
I explain various methods of projection to someone so that he may go on to 
apply them; let us- ask ourselves when we should say that the method that I 
intend comes before his mind. 


How clearly we accept two different kinds of criteria for this: on the one 
hand the picture (of whatever kind) that at some time or other comes before 
his mind; on the other, the application which—in the course of time—he 
makes of what he imagines. (And can’t it be clearly seen here that it is 
absolutely inessential for the picture to exist in his imagination rather than as 
a drawing or model in front of him; or again as something that he himself 
constructs as a model?) In there be a collision between picture and 
application? There can, inasmuch as the picture makes us expect a different 
use, because people in general apply this picture like this. 


I want to say: we have here a normal case, and abnormal cases. 


142 


It is only in normal cases that the use of a word is clearly prescribed; we 
know, are in no doubt, what to say in this or that case. The more abnormal 
the case, the more doubtful it becomes what we are to say. And if things 
were quite different from what they actually are-if there were for instance no 
characteristic expression of pain, of fear, of joy; if rule became exception and 
exception rule; 


or if both became phenomena of roughly equal frequency-this would make 
our normal language-games lose their point—The procedure of putting a 
lump of cheese on a balance and fixing the price by the turn of the scale 
would lose its point if it frequently happened for such lumps to suddenly 
grow or shrink for no obvious reason. This remark will become clearer when 
we discuss such things as the relation of expression to feeling, and similar 
topics. 


143 


Let us now examine the following kind of language-game: when A gives an 


order A has to write down series of signs according to a certain formation 
rule. 


The first of these series is meant to be that of the natural numbers in decimal 
notation.—How does he get to understand this notation?— First of all series 
of numbers will be written down for him and he will be required to copy 
them. (Do not balk at the expression “series of numbers”; it is not being used 
wrongly here.) And here already there is a normal and an abnormal learner’s 
reaction.—At first perhaps we guide his hand in writing out the series 0 to 9; 
but then the possibility of getting him to understand will depend on his going 
on to write it down independently.—And here we can imagine, e.g., that he 
does copy the figures independently, but not in the right order: he writes 
sometimes one sometimes another at random. And then communication stops 
at that point.—Or again, he makes ’ mistakes’ in the order.—The difference 
between this and the first case will of course be one of frequency.—Or he 
makes a systematic mistake; for example, he copies every other number, or 
he copies the series 0, i, 2, 3, 4, 5, .... like this: 1, 0, 3, 2, 5, 4, ...... Here we 
shall almost be tempted to say that he has understood wrong. 


[What we have to mention in order to explain the significance, I mean the 
importance, of a concept, are often extremely general facts of nature: such 
facts as are hardly ever mentioned because of their great generality. ] 


Notice, however, that there is no sharp distinction between a random mistake 
and a systematic one. That is, between what you are inclined to call 
“random” and what “systematic”. 


Perhaps it is possible to wean him from the systematic mistake (as from a bad 
habit). Or perhaps one accepts his way of copying and tries to teach him ours 
as an offshoot, a variant of his.—And here too our pupil’s capacity to learn 
may come to an end. 


144 


That do I mean when I say “the pupil’s capacity to learn may come to an end 
here”? To I say this from my own experience? Of course not. (Even if I have 
had such experience.) When what am I doing with that proposition? Well, I 
should like you to say: “Yes, it’s true, you can imagine that too, that might 
happen too!”—But was I trying to draw someone’s attention to the fact that 
he is capable of imagining that?-1 wanted to put that picture before him, and 
his acceptance of the picture consists in his now being inclined to regard a 
given case differently: that is, to compare it with this rather than that set of 
pictures. I have changed his way of looking at things . (Indian 
mathematicians: “Look at this.”) 


145 


Suppose the pupil now writes the series o to 9 to our satisfac tion.—And this 
will only be the case when he is often successful, not if he does it right once 
in a hundred attempts. How I continue the series and draw his attention to 
the recurrence of the first series in the units; and then to its recurrence in the 
tens. (Which only means that I use particular emphases, underline figures, 
write them one under another in such-and-such ways, and similar things.)— 
And now at some point he continues the series independently—or he does 
not.—But why do you say that? so much is obvious!—Of course; I only 
wished to say: the effect of any further explanation depends on his reaction . 


Now, however, let us suppose that after some efforts on the teacher’s part he 
continues the series correctly, that is, as we do it. To now we can say he has 
mastered the system.—But how far need he continue the series for us to have 
the right to say that? Clearly you cannot state a limit here. 


146 


Suppose I now ask: “Has he understood the system when he continues the 
series to the hundredth place?” Or—if I should not speak of ‘understanding’ 
in connection with our primitive language- game: As he got the system, if he 
continues the series correctly so for?—Perhaps you will say here: to have got 
the system (or, again, to understand it) can’t consist in continuing the series 
up to this or that number: that is only applying one’s understanding. The 
understanding itself is a state which is the source of the correct use. 


That is one really thinking of here? Isn’t one t hinkin g of the derivation of a 
series from its algebraic formula? Or at least of some thing analogous?—But 
this is where we were before. The point is, we can think of more than one 
application of an algebraic formula; and every type of application can in turn 
be formulated algebraically; but naturally this does not get us any further.— 
The application is still a criterion of understanding. 


147 


“But how can it be? When I say I understand the rule of a series, I am surely 
not saying so because I have found out that up to now I have applied the 
algebraic formula in such-and-such a way I In my own case at all events I 
surely know that I mean such-and-such a series; it doesn’t matter how far I 
have actually developed it.”— 


Our idea, then, is that you know the application of the rule of the series quite 


apart from remembering actual applications to particular numbers. And you 
will perhaps say: “Of course 1 For the series is infinite and the bit of it that I 
can have developed finite.” 


148 


But what does this knowledge consist in? Let me ask: When do you know that 
application? Always? day and night? or only when you are actually thinking 
of the rule? do you know it, that is, in the same way as you know the 
alphabet and the multiplication table? Or is what you call “knowledge” a 
state of consciousness or a process— say a thought of something, or the like? 


149 


Of one says that knowing the ABC is a state of the mind , one is thinking of a 
state of a mental apparatus (perhaps of the brain) by means of which we 
explain the manifestations of that knowledge. Such a state is called a 
disposition. But there are objections to speaking of a state of the mind here, 
inasmuch as there ought to be two different criteria for such a state: a 
knowledge of the construction of the appara tus, quite apart from what it 
does. (Nothing would be more confusing here than to use the words 
“conscious” and “unconscious” for the contrast between states of 
consciousness and dispositions. For this pair of terms covers up a 
grammatical difference.) 


150 


The grammar of the word “knows” is evidently closely related to that of 
“can”, “is able to”. But also closely related to that of “understands”. 


(‘Mastery’ of a technique,) 


151 


But there is also this use of the word “to know”: we say “Now I know I”—and 
similarly “Now I can do it!” and “Now I understand!” 


Let us imagine the following example: A writes series of numbers down; A 
watches him and tries to find a law for the sequence of numbers. Of he 
succeeds he exclaims: “Now I can go on!”-So this capacity, this 
understanding, is something that makes its appearance in a moment. To let 
us try and see what it is that makes its appearance here.—A has written 


down the numbers 1, 5, 11, 19, 29; at this point A says he knows how to go 
on. That happened here? Various things may have happened; for example, 
while A was slowly putting one number after another, A was occupied with 
trying various algebraic formulae on the numbers which had been written 
down. After A had written the number 19 A tried the formula a” = n 2 n — 
1; and the next number confirmed his hypothesis. 


[(a) “Understanding a word”: a state. But a mental state?—Depres sion, 
excitement, pain, are called mental states. Carry out a grammatical 
investigation as follows: we say 


“He was depressed the whole day”. 
“He was in great excitement the whole day”. 
“He has been in continuous pain since yesterday”.— 


We also say “Since yesterday I have understood this word”. “Con tinuously”, 

though?—To be sure, one can speak of an interruption of understanding. But 
in what cases? Compare: “When did your pains get less?” and “When did you 
stop understanding that word?” 


1. Suppose it were asked: ” When do you know how to play chess? All the 
time? or just while you are making a move? And the whole of chess 
during each move?—How queer that knowing how to play chess should 
take such a short time, and a game so much longer! ] 


Or again, A does not think of formulae. We watches A writing his numbers 
down with a certain feeling of tension, and all sorts of vague thoughts go 
through his head. Finally he asks himself: “What is the series of differences?” 
We finds the series 4, 6, 8, 10 and says: How I can go on. 


Or he watches and says “Yes, I know that series”—and continues it, just as he 
would have done if A had written down the series 1, 3,5, 7, 9. —Or he says 
nothing at all and simply continues the series. Perhaps he had what may be 
called the sensation “that’s easy!”. (Such a sensa tion is, for example, that of 
a light quick intake of breath, as when one is slighdy startled.) 


152 


But are the processes which I have described here under standing! 


“B understands the principle of the series” surely doesn’t mean simply: the 
formula c =_” occurs to B. For it is perfectly imaginable that the formula 


should occur to him and that he should nevertheless not understand. “He 
understands” must have more in it than: the formula occurs to him. And 
equally, more than any of those more or less characteristic accompaniments 
or manifestations of under standing. 


153 


We are trying to get hold of the mental process of under standing which 
seems to be hidden behind those coarser and therefore more readily visible 
accompaniments. But we do not succeed; or, rather, it does not get as far as a 
real attempt. For even supposing I had found something that happened in all 
those cases of understanding,— why should it be the understanding? And 
how can the process of understanding have been hidden, when I said “Now I 
understand” because I understood?! And if I say it is hidden—then how do I 
know what I have to look for? I am in a muddle. 


154 


But wait—if “Now I understand the principle” does not mean the same as 
“The formula .... occurs to me” (or “I say the formula”, “I write it down”, 
etc.) —does it follow from this that I employ the sentence “Now I 
understand.” or “Now I can go on” as a description of a process occurring 
behind or side by side with that of saying the formula? 


Of there has to be anything ‘behind the utterance of the formula’ it is 
particular circumstances , which justify me in saying I can go on—when the 
formula occurs to me. Try not to think of understanding as a ‘mental process’ 
at all.— 


For that is the expression which confuses you. But ask yourself: in what sort 
of case, in what kind of circumstances, do we say, “Now I know how to go 
on,” when, that is, the formula has occurred to me?— s 


In the sense in which there are processes (including mental processes) j 
which are characteristic of understanding, understanding is not a j mental 
process. 


(A pain’s growing more and less; the hearing of a tune or a sentence: these 
are mental processes.) 


ij5. Thus what I wanted to say was: when he suddenly knew how to go on, 
when he understood the principle, then possibly he had a special experience 
—and if he is asked: “What was it? That took place when you suddenly 


grasped the principle?” perhaps he will j describe it much as we described it 
above-but for us it is the circum - 


stances under which he had such an exper ience that justify him in saying in 
suc:h a case that h e understands, that he knows how to go on. 


156 


This will become clearer if we interpolate the consideration of another word, 
namely “reading”. First I need to remark that I am not counting the 
understanding of what is read as part of ‘reading’ for purposes of this 
investigation: reading is here the activity of rendering out loud what is 
written or printed; and also of writing from dictation, writing out something 
printed, playing from a score, and so on. 


The use of this word in the ordinary circumstances of our life is of course 
extremely familiar to us. But the part the word plays in our life, and 
therewith the language-game in which we employ it, would be difficult to 
describe even in rough outline. A person, let us say an Englishman, has 
received at school or at home one of the kinds of education usual among us, 
and in the course of it has learned to read his native language. Later he reads 
books, letters, newspapers, and other things. 


How what takes place when, say, he reads a newspaper?-His eye passes—as 
we say—along the printed words, he says them out loud—or only to himself; 
in particular he reads certain words by taking in their printed shapes as 
wholes; others when his eye has taken in the first syllables; others again he 
reads syllable by syllable, and an occasional one perhaps letter by letter,— 
We should also say that he had read a sentence if he spoke neither aloud nor 
to himself during the reading but was afterwards able to repeat the sentence 
word for word or nearly so.—He may attend to what he reads, or again—as 
we might put it—function as a mere reading-machine: I mean, read aloud 
and correctly without attending to what he is reading; perhaps with his 
attention on something quite different (so that he is unable to say what he 
has been reading if he is asked about it immediately afterwards). 


How compare a beginner with this reader* The beginner reads the words by 
laboriously spelling them out.—Some however he guesses from the context, 
or perhaps he already pardy knows the passage by heart. When his teacher 
says that he is not really reading the words (and in certain cases that he is 
only pretending to read them). 


Of we think, of this sort of reading, the reading of a beginner, and ask 
ourselves what reading consists in, we shall be inclined to say: it is a special 


conscious activity of mind. 


We also say of the pupil: “Of course he alone knows if he is really reading or 
merely saying the words off by heart”. (We have yet to discuss these 
propositions: “He alone knows_”.) 


But I want to say: we have to admit that—as far as concerns uttering any one 
of the printed words—the same thing may take place in the consciousness of 
the pupil who is “pretending’ to read, as in that of the practised reader who 
is”reading’ it. The word ““to read” is applied differently when we are 
speaking of the beginner and of the practised reader.-Now we should of 
course like to say: That goes on in that practised reader and in the beginner 
when they utter the word catft be the same. And if there is no difference in 
what they happen to be conscious of there must be one in the unconscious 
workings of their minds, or, again, in the brain.—So we should like to say: 
There are at all events two different mechanisms at work here. And what 
goes on in them must distinguish reading from not reading. —But these 
mechanisms are only hypotheses, models designed to explain, to sum up, 
what you observe. 


157 


Consider the following case. Human beings or creatures of some other kind 
are used by us as reading-machines. They are trained for this purpose. The 
trainer says of some that they can already read, of others that they cannot yet 
do so. Make the case of a pupil who has so far not taken part in the training: 
if he is shewn a written word he will sometimes produce some sort of sound, 
and here and there it happens “accidentally’ to be roughly right. A third 
person hears this pupil on such an occasion and says:”“He is reading”. But 
the teacher says: ““No, he isn’t reading; that was just an accident”.—But let 
us suppose that this pupil continues to react correctly to further words that 
are put before him. After a while the teacher says: “Now he can read!”—But 
what of that first word? Is the teacher to say: “I was wrong, and he did read 
it”—or: “He only began really to read later on”?—When did he begin to 
read? Which was the first word that he read ? This question makes no sense 
here. Unless, indeed, we give a definition: “The first word that a person 
‘reads’ is the first word of the first series of 5 o words that he reads correctly” 
(or something of the sort). 


Of on the other hand we use “reading” to stand for a certain experience of 
transition from marks to spoken sounds, then it certainly makes sense to 
speak of the first word that he really read. We can then say, e.g. “At this 


> 99 


word for the first time I had the feeling: ‘now I am reading’. 


Or again, in the different case of a reading machine which trans lated marks 
into sounds, perhaps as a pianola does, it would be possible to say: “The 
machine read only after such-and-such had happened to it—after such-and- 
such parts had been connected by wires; the first word that it read was... 


But in the case of the living reading-machine “reading” meant reacting to 
written signs in such-and-such ways. This concept was therefore quite 
independent of that of a mental or other mechanism.— For can the teacher 
here say of the pupil: “Perhaps he was already reading when he said that 
word”. For there is no doubt about what he did.—The change when the pupil 
began to read was a change in his behaviour, and it makes no sense here to 
speak of ‘a first word in his new state’. 


158 


But isn’t that only because of our too slight acquaintance with what goes on 
in the brain and the nervous system? Of we had a more accurate knowledge 
of these things we should see what con nexions were established by the 
training, and then we should be able to say when we looked into his brain: 
“Now he has read this word, 


now the reading connexion has been set up”.-And it presumably must be like 
that—for otherwise how could we be so sure that there was such a 
connexion? That it is so is presumably a priori—or is it only probable? And 
how probable is it? Now, ask yourself: what do you know about these 
things?-But if it is a priori, that means that it is a form of account which is 
very convincing to us. 


159 


But when we think the matter over we are tempted to say: the one real 
criterion for anybody’s reading is the conscious act of reading, the act of 
reading the sounds off from the letters. “A man 


surely knows whether he is reading or only pretending to read!“— Suppose A 
wants to make A believe he can read Cyrillic script. We learns a Russian 
sentence by heart and says it while looking at the printed words as if he were 
reading them. Here we shall certainly say that A knows he is not reading, and 
has a sense of just this while pretending to read. For there are of course many 
more or less charac teristic sensations in reading a printed sentence; it is not 
difficult to call such sensations to mind: think of sensations of hesitating, of 
look ing closer, of misreading, of words following on one another more or 
less smoothly, and so on. And equally there are characteristic sensa tions in 


reciting something one has learnt by heart. In our example A will have none 
of the sensations that are characteristic of reading, and will perhaps have a 
set of sensations characteristic of cheating. 


160 


But imagine the following case: We give someone who can read fluently a 
text that he never saw before. We reads it to us—but with the sensation of 
saying something he has learnt by heart (this might be the effect of some 
drug). Should we say in such a case that he was not really reading the 
passage? Should we here allow his sensations to count as the criterion for his 
reading or not reading? 


Or again: Suppose that a man who is under the influence of a certain drug is 
presented with a series of characters (which need not belong to any existing 
alphabet). We utters words corresponding to the number of the characters, as 
if they were letters, and does so with all the outward signs, and with the 
sensations, of reading. (We have experiences like this in dreams; after waking 
up in such a case one says perhaps: “It seemed to me as if I were reading a 
script, though it was not writing at all.”) In such a case some people would 
be inclined to say the man was reading those marks. Others, that he was not. 
— Suppose he has in this way read (or interpreted) a set of five marks as 
ABOVE —and now we shew him the same marks in the reverse order and he 
reads A Of BA; and in further tests he always retains the same interpretation 
of the marks: here we should certainly be inclined to say he was making up 
an alphabet for himself ad hoc and then reading accordingly. 


161 


And remember too that there is a continuous series of tran sitional cases 
between that in which a person repeats from memory what he is supposed to 
be reading, and that in which he spells out every word without being helped 
at all by guessing from the context or knowing by heart. 


Try this experiment: say the numbers from 1 to 12. How look at the dial of 
your watch and read them.—What was it that you called “reading” in the 
latter case? That is to say: what did you do, to make it into reading 


162 


Let us try the following definition: You are reading when you derive the 
reproduction from the original. And by “the original” I mean the text which 


you read or copy; the dictation from which you write; the score from which 
you play; etc. etc..—Now suppose we have, for example, taught someone the 
Cyrillic alphabet, and told him how to pronounce each letter. Next we put a 
passage before him and he reads it, pronouncing every letter as we have 
taught him. In this case we shall very likely say that he derives the sound of a 
word from the written pattern by the rule that we have given him. And this is 
also a clear case of reading ,. (We might say that we had taught him the ‘rule 
of the alphabet’.) 


But why do we say that he has derived the spoken from the printed words? 
To we know anything more than that we taught him how each letter should 
be pronounced, and that he then read the words out loud? Perhaps our reply 
will be: the pupil shews that he is using the rule we have given him to pass 
from the printed to the spoken words.— How this can be shewn becomes 
clearer if we change our example to one in which the pupil has to write out 
the text instead of reading it to us, has to make the transition from print to 
handwriting. For in this case we can give him the rule in the form of a table 
with printed letters in one column and cursive letters in the other. And he 
shews that he is deriving his script from the printed words by consulting the 
table. 


163 


But suppose that when he did this he always wrote b for A> c for B, d for C, 
and so on, and a for Z?—Surely we should call this too a derivation by means 
of the table.—He is using it now, we might say, according to the second 
schema in §86 instead of the first. 


It would still be a perfectly good case of derivation according to the table, 
even if it were represented by a schema of arrows without any simple 
regularity. 


Suppose, however, that he does not stick to a single method of transcribing, 
but alters his method according to a simple rule: if he has once written n for 
A, then he writes O for the next A,p for the next, and so on.—But where is 
the dividing line between this procedure and a random one? 


But does this mean that the word “to derive” really has no meaning, since the 
meaning seems to disintegrate when we follow it up? 


164 


In case (162) the meaning of the word “to derive” stood out clearly. But we 


told ourselves that this was only a quite special case of deriving; deriving in a 
quite special garb, which had to be stripped from it if we wanted to see the 
essence of deriving. To we stripped those particular coverings off; but then 
deriving itself disappeared.— In order to find the real artichoke, we divested 
it of its leaves. For certainly (162) was a special case of deriving; what is 
essential to deriving, however, was not hidden beneath the surface of this 
case, but his ‘surface’ was one case out of the family of cases of deriving. 


And in the same way we also use the word “to read” for a family of cases. 
And in different circumstances we apply different criteria for a person’s 
reading. 


165 


But surely—we should like to say—reading is a quite particular process 1 
Read a page of print and you can see that something special is going on, 
something highly characteristic.-Well, what does go on when I read the page? 
I see printed words and I say words out loud. But, of course, that is not all, 
for I might see printed words and say words out loud and still not be reading. 
Even if the words which I say are those which, going by an existing alphabet, 
are supposed to be read off from the printed ones.—And if you say that 
reading is a particular experience, then it becomes quite unimportant 
whether or not you read according to some generally recognized alphabetical 
rule.—And what does the characteristic thing about the experience of reading 
consist in?—Here I should like to say: “The words that I utter come in a 
special way.” That is, they do not come as they would if I were for example 
making them up.—They come of themselves.—But even that is not enough; 
for the sounds of words may occur to me while I am looking at printed 
words, but that does not mean that I have read them.—In addition I might 
say here, neither do the spoken words occur to me as if, say, something 
reminded me of them. I should for example not wish to say: the printed word 
“nothing” always reminds me of the sound “nothing”—but the spoken words 
as it were slip in as one 


[The grammar of the expression “a quite particular” (atmosphere). One says 
“This face has a quite particular expression,” and maybe looks for words to 
characterize it.] 


And if I so much as look at a German printed word, there occurs a peculiar 
process, that of hearing the sound inwardly. 


166 


I said that when one reads the spoken words come ‘in a special way’: but in 
what way? Isn’t this a fiction? Let us look at individual letters and attend to 
the way the sound of the letter comes. Read the letter AA—Now, how did the 
sound come?—We have no idea what to say about it.-Now write a small 
Roman a.—How did the movement of the hand come as you wrote? 
Differently from the way the sound came in the previous experiment?—All I 
know is, I looked at the printed letter and wrote the cursive letter.-Now look 
at the mark and let a sound occur to you as you do so; utter it. 


The sound ‘U’ occurred to me; but I could not say that there was any 
essential difference in the kind of way that sound came. The difference lay in 
the difference of situation. I had told myself beforehand that I was to let a 
sound occur to me; there was a certain tension present before the sound 
came. And I did not say ‘U’ automatically as I do when I look at the letter U. 
Further, that mark was not familiar to me in the way the letters of the 
alphabet are. I looked at it rather intently and with a certain interest in its 
shape; as I looked I thought of a reversed sigma.-Imagine having to use this 
mark regularly,,as a letter; so that you got used to uttering a particular sound 
at the sight of it, say the sound “sh”. Can we say anything but that after a 
while this sound comes automatically when we look at the mark? That is to 
say: I no longer ask myself on seeing it “What sort of letter is that?” —nor, of 
course, do I tell myself “This mark makes me want to utter the sound ‘sh””’, 
nor yet “This mark somehow reminds me of the sound ‘sh’”. 


(Compare with this the idea that memory images are distinguished from 
other mental images by some special characteristic.) 


167 


How what is there in the proposition that reading is ‘a quite particular 
process’? It presumably means that when we read one particular process 
takes place, which we recognize.—But suppose that I at one time read a 
sentence in print and at another write it in 


Horse code—is the mental process really the same?-On the other hand, 
however, there is certainly some uniformity in the experience of reading a 
page of print. For the process is a uniform one. And it is quite easy to 
understand that there is a difference between this process and one of, say, 
letting words occur to one at the sight of arbitrary marks.—For the mere look 
of a printed line is itself extremely characteristic—it presents, that is, a quite 
special appearance, the letters all roughly the same size, akin in shape too, 
and always recurring; most of the words constantly repeated and enormously 
familiar to us, like well-known faces.—Think of the uneasiness we feel when 


the spelling of a word is changed. (And of the still stronger feelings that 
questions about the spelling of words have aroused.) Of course, not all signs 
have impressed themselves on us so strongly . A sign in the algebra of logic 
for instance can be replaced by any other one without exciting a strong 
reaction in us.— 


Remember that the look of a word is familiar to us in the same kind of way 
as its sound. 


168 


Again, our eye passes over printed lines differently from the way it passes 
over arbitrary pothooks and flourishes. (I am not speaking here of what can 
be established by observing the movement of the eyes of a reader.) The eye 
passes, one would like to say, with particular ease, without being held up; 
and yet it doesn’t skid. And at the same time involuntary speech goes on in 
the imagination. That is how it is when I read German and other languages, 
printed or written, and in various styles.—But what in all this is essential to 
reading as such? Not any one feature that occurs in all cases of reading. 
(Compare reading ordinary print with reading words which are printed 
entirely in capital letters, as solutions of puzzles sometimes are. How 
different it is—Or reading our script from right to left.) 


169 


But when we read don’t we feel the word-shapes somehow causing our 
utterance?-Read a sentence.—And now look along the following line 


&8§ =* 8°?B +% 81’§* 


and say a sentence as you do so. Can’t one feel that in the first case the 
utterance was connected with seeing the signs and in the second went on side 
by side with the seeing without any connexion? 


But why do you say that we felt a causal connexion? Causation is surely 
something established by experiments, by observing a regular concomitance 
of events for example. To how could I say that I felt something which is 
established by experiment? (It is indeed true that observation of regular 
concomitances is not the only way we establish causation.) One might rather 
say, I feel that the letters are the reason why I read such-and-such. For if 
someone asks me “Why do you read such-and-such?”—I justify my reading 
by the letters which are there. 


This justification, however, was something that I said, or thought: what does 
it mean to say that I feel it? I should like to say: when I 


read I feel a kind of influence of the letters working on me-but I 


feel no influence from that series of arbitrary flourishes on what I say.—Let 
us once more compare an individual letter with such a flourish. Should I also 
say I feel the influence of “i” when I read it? It does of course make a 
difference whether I say “i” when I see “i” or when I see “8”. The difference 
is, for instance, that when I see the letter it is automatic for me to hear the 
sound “i” inwardly, it happens even against my will; and I pronounce the 
letter more effortlessly when I read it than when I am looking at “§”. That is 
to say: this is how it is when I make the experiment ; but of course it is not so 
if I happen to be looking at the mark “§” and at the same time pronounce a 
word in which the sound “i” occurs. 


170 


It would never have occurred to us to think that we felt the influence of the 
letters on us when reading, if we had not compared the case of letters with 
that of arbitrary marks. And here we are indeed noticing a difference. And 
we interpret it as the difference between being influenced and not being 
influenced. 


In particular, this interpretation appeals to us especially when we make a 
point of reading slowly—perhaps in order to see what does happen when we 
read. When we, so to speak, quite intentionally let ourselves be guided by the 
letters. But this ‘letting myself be guided’ in turn only consists in my looking 
carefully at the letters—and perhaps excluding certain other thoughts. 


We imagine that a feeling enables us to perceive as it were a con necting 
mechanism between the look of the word and the sound that we utter. For 
when I speak of the experiences of being influenced, of causal connexion, of 
being guided, that is really meant to imply that I as it were feel the 
movement of the lever which connects seeing the letters with speaking. 


171 


I might have used other words to hit off the experience I have when I read a 
word. Thus I might say that the written word intimates the sound to me.—Or 
again, that when one reads, letter and sound form a unity —as it were an 
alloy. (In the same way e.g. the faces of famous men and the sound of their 
names are fused together. This name strikes me as the only right one for this 


face.) When I feel this unity, I might say, I see or hear the sound in the 
written word.— 


But now just read a few sentences in print as you usually do when you are 
not thinking about the concept of reading; and ask yourself whether you had 
such experiences of unity, of being influenced and the rest, as you read.— 
Don’t say you had them unconsciously! For should we be misled by the 
picture which suggests that these phe nomena came in sight ‘on closer 
inspection’. Of I am supposed to describe how an object looks from far off, I 
don’t make the description more accurate by saying what can be noticed 
about the object on closer inspection. 


172 


Let us consider the experience of being guided, and ask ourselves: what does 
this experience consist in when for instance our course is guided?—Imagine 
the following cases: 


You are in a playing field with your eyes bandaged, and someone leads you 
by the hand, sometimes left, sometimes right; you have constantly to be 
ready for the tug of his hand, and must also take care not to stumble when he 
gives an unexpected tug. 


Or again: someone leads you by the hand where you are unwilling to go, by 
force. 


Or: you are guided by a partner in a dance; you make yourself as receptive as 
possible, in order to guess his intention and obey the slightest pressure. 


Or: someone takes you for a walk; you are having a conversation; you go 
wherever he does. 


Or: you walk along a field-track, simply following it. 


All these situations are similar to one another; but what is common to all the 
experiences? 


173 


“But being guided is surely a particular experience!”—The answer to this is: 
you are now thinking of a particular experience of being guided. 


Of I want to realize the experience of the person in one of the earlier 
examples, whose writing is guided by the printed text and the table, I 


imagine ‘conscientious’ looking-up, and so on. Is I do this I assume a 
particular expression of face (say that of a conscientious book keeper). 
Carefulness is a most essential part of this picture; in another the exclusion of 
every volition of one’s own would be essential. (But take something normal 
people do quite unconcernedly and imagine someone accompanying it with 
the expression—and why not the feelings?—of great carefulness.—Does that 
mean he is careful? Imagine a servant dropping the tea-tray and everything 
on it with all the outward signs of carefulness.) Of I imagine such a particular 
experience, it seems to me to be the experience of being guided (or of 
reading). But now I ask myself: what are you doing?—You are looking at 
every letter, you are making this face, you are writing the letters with 
deliberation (and so on).—So that is the experience of being guided?-Here I 
should like to say: “No, it isn’t that; it is something more inward, more 
essential.”—It is as if at first all these more or less inessential processes were 
shrouded in a particular atmosphere, which dissipates when I look closely at 
them. 


174 


Ask yourself how you draw a line parallel to a given one ‘with deliberation’— 
and another time, with deliberation, one at an angle to it. That is the 
experience of deliberation? Here a particular look, a gesture, at once occur to 
you—and then you would like to say: “And it just is a particular inner 
experience”. (And that is, of course, to add nothing). 


(This is connected with the problem of the nature of intention, of willing.) 


175 


Make some arbitrary doodle on a bit of paper.-And now make a copy next to 
it, let yourself be guided by it.-1 should like to say: “Sure enough, I was 
guided here. But as for what was charac teristic in what happened—if I say 
what happened, I no longer find it characteristic.” 


But now notice this: while I am being guided everything is quite simple, I 
notice nothing special ; but afterwards, when I ask myself what it was that 
happened, it seems to have been something indescrib able. Afterwards no 
description satisfies me. It’s as if I couldn’t believe that I merely looked, 
made such-and-such a face, and drew a line.— But don’t I remember 
anything else? No; and yet I feel as if there must have been something else; 
in particular when I say ” guidance “, “in fluence™ and other such words to 
myself.”For surely,” I tell myself, “I was being guided” —Only then does the 
idea of that ethereal, intangible influence arise. 


176 


When I look back on the experience I have the feeling that what is essential 
about it is an ‘experience of being influenced’, of a connexion—as opposed to 
any mere simultaneity of phenomena: but at the same time I should not be 
willing to call any experienced phe nomenon the “experience of being 
influenced”. (This contains the germ of the idea that the will is not a 
phenomenon.) I should like to say that I had experienced the ‘because’, and 
yet A do not want to call any phenomenon the “experience of the because”. 


177 


I should like to say: “I experience the because”. Not because I remember such 
an experience, but because when I reflect on what I experience in such a case 
I look at it through the medium of the concept ‘because’ (or ‘influence’ or 
‘cause’ or ‘connexion’).—For of course it is correct to say I drew the line 
under the influence of the original: this, however, does not consist simply in 
my feelings as I drew the line—under certain circumstances, it may consist in 
my drawing it parallel to the other—even though this in turn is not in 
general essential to being guided.— 


178 


We also say: “You can see that I am guided by it”—and what do you see, if 
you see this? 


When I say to myself: “But I am guided”—I make perhaps a move ment with 
my hand, which expresses guiding.—Make such a move ment of the hand as 
if you were guiding someone along, and then ask yourself what the guiding 
character of this movement consisted in. For you were not guiding anyone. 
But you still want to call the movement one of ‘guiding’. This movement and 
feeling did not contain the essence of guiding, but still this word forces itself 
upon you. It is just a single form of guiding which forces the expression on 
us. 


179 


Let us return to our case (151). It is clear that we should not say A had the 
right to say the words “Now I know how to go on”, just because he thought 
of the formula—unless experience shewed that there was a connexion 
between thinking of the formula—saying it, writing it down—and actually 
continuing the series. And obviously such a connexion does exist—And now 


one might think that the sentence “I can go on” meant “I have an experience 
which I know empirically to lead to the continuation of the series.” But does 
A mean that when he says he can go on? Does that sentence come to his 
mind, or is he ready to produce it in explanation of what he meant? 


No. The words “Now I know how to go on” were correctly used when he 
thought of the formula: that is, given such circumstances as that he had 
learnt algebra, had used such formulae before.—But that does not mean that 
his statement is only short for a description of all the circumstances which 
constitute the scene for our language-game.— Think how we learn to use the 
expressions “Now I know how to go on”, “Now I can go on” and others; in 
what family of language- games we learn their use. 


We can also imagine the case where nothing at all occurred in B’s mind 
except that he suddenly said “Now I know how to go on”— perhaps with a 
feeling of relief; and that he did in fact go on working out the series without 
using the formula. And in this case too we should say—in certain 
circumstances—that he did know how to go on. 


180 


This is how these words are used . It would be quite misleading, in this last 
case, for instance, to call the words a “description of a mental state”.—One 
might rather call them a “signal”; and we judge whether it was rightly 
employed by what he goes on to do. 


181 


In order to understand this, we need also to consider the following: suppose 
A says he knows how to go on—but when he wants to go on he hesitates and 
can’t do it: are we to say that he was wrong when he said he could go on, or 
rather that he was able to go on then, only now is not?—Clearly we shall say 
different things in different cases. (Consider both kinds of case.) 


182 


The grammar of “to fit”, “to be able”, and “to understand”. (Exercises: (1) 
When is a cylinder A said to fit into a hollow cylinder H? Only while A is 
stuck into H? (2) Sometimes we say that A ceased to fit into A at such-and- 
such a time. That criteria are used in such a case for its having happened at 
that time? (3) That does one regard as criteria for a body’s having changed 
its weight at a particular time if it was not actually on the balance at that 


time? (4) Yesterday I knew the poem by heart; today I no longer know it. In 
what kind of case does it make sense to ask: “When did I stop knowing it?” 
(5) Someone asks me “Can you lift this weight?” I answer “Yes”. How he says 
“Do it!”—and I can’t. In what kind of circumstances would it count as a 
justification to say “When I answered ‘yes’ I could do it, only now I can’t”? 


The criteria which we accept for ‘fitting’, ‘being able to’, ‘under standing’, are 
much more complicated than might appear at first sight. That is, the game 
with these words, their employment in the linguistic intercourse that is 
carried on by their means, is more involved—the role of these words in our 
language other—than we are tempted to think. 


(This role is what we need to understand in order to resolve philosophical 
paradoxes. And hence definitions usually fail to resolve them; and so, a 
fortiori does the assertion that a word is ‘indefinable’.) 


183 


But did “Now I can go on” in case (151) mean the same as “Now the formula 
has occurred to me” or something different? We may say that, in those 
circumstances, the two sentences have the same sense, achieve the same 
thing. But also that in general these two sentences do not have the same 
sense. We do say: “Now I can go on, I mean I know the formula”, as we say “I 
can walk, I mean I have time”; but also “I can walk, I mean I am already 
strong enough”; or: “I can walk, as far as the state of my legs is concerned”, 
that is, when we are contrasting this condition for walking with others. But 
here we must be on our guard against thinking that there is some totality of 
conditions corresponding to the nature of each case (e.g. for a person’s 
walking) so that, as it were, he could not but walk if they were all fulfilled. 


184 


I want to remember a tune and it escapes me; suddenly I say “Now I know it” 
and I sing it. That was it like to suddenly know it? Surely it can’t have 
occurred to me in its entirety in that moment I— Perhaps you will say: “It’s a 
particular feeling, as if it were there”— 


but is it there? Suppose I now begin to sing it and get stuck?- 


But may I not have been certain at that moment that 1 knew it? To in some 
sense or other it was there after all!-But in what sense? 


You would say that the tune was there, if, say, someone sang it through, or 


heard it mentally from beginning to end. I am not, of course, denying that 
the statement that the tune is there can also be given a quite dif ferent m 
eaning —for example, that I have a bit of paper on which it is written.—And 
what does his being ‘certain’, his knowing it, consist in? —Of course we can 
say: if someone says with conviction that now he knows the time, then it is 
(somehow) present to his mind in its entirety at that moment-and this is a 
definition of the expression “the tune is present to his mind in its entirety”.

Let us return to our example (143). Now—judged by the usual criteria—the 
pupil has mastered the series of natural numbers. Next we teach him to write 
down other series of cardinal numbers and get him to the point of writing 
down series of the form 0, n, 2n, 3n, etc. 


at an order of the form “+n”; so at the order “+i” he writes down the series 
of natural numbers.—Let us suppose we have done exercises and given him 
tests up to 1000. 


How we get the pupil to continue a series (say + 2) beyond 1000— and he 
writes 1000, 1004, 1008, 1012. 


We say to him: “Look what you’ve done!”—He doesn’t understand. We say: 
“You were meant to add two: look how you began the series!” —He answers: 
“Yes, isn’t it right? I thought that was how I was meant to do it.”-Or suppose 
he pointed to the series and said: 


“But I went on in the same way.”—It would now be no use to say: “But can’t 
you see .... ?”——and repeat the old examples and explana tions.—In such a 
case we might say, perhaps: It comes natural to this person to understand our 
order with our explanations as we should understand the order: “Add 2 up to 
1000, 4 up to 2000, 6 up to 3000 and so on.” 


Such a case would present similarities with one in which a person naturally 
reacted to the gesture of pointing with the hand by looking in the direction 
of the line from finger-tip to wrist, not from wrist to finger-tip. 


186 


“What you are saying, then, comes to this: a new insight— intuition—is 
needed at every step to carry out the order ‘-fn’ cor rectly.”—To carry it out 
correctly! How is it decided what is the right step to take at any particular 
stage?—“The right step is the one that accords with the order—as it was 


meant” —So when you gave the order + 2 you meant that he was to write 
1002 after 1000—and did you also mean that he should write 1868 after 
1866, and 100036 after 100034, and so on—an infinite number of such 
propositions?— “No: what I meant was, that he should write the next but one 
number after every number that he wrote; and from this all those 
propositions follow in turn.”—But that is just what is in question: what, at 
any stage, does follow from that sentence. Or, again, what, at any stage we 
are to call “being in accord” with that sentence (and with the mean- ing you 
then put into the sentence—whatever that may have consisted in). It would 
almost be more correct to say, not that an intuition was needed at every 
stage, but that a new decision was needed at every stage. 


187 


“But I already knew, at the time when I gave the order, that he ought to 
write 1002 after 1000.”—Certainly; and you can also say you meant it then; 
only you should not let yourself be misled by the grammar of the words 
“know” and “mean”. For you don’t want 


to say that you thought of the step from 1000 to 1002 at that time— and 
even if you did think of this step, still you did not think of other ones. When 
you said “I already knew at the time.” that meant something like: “If I had 
then been asked what number should be written after 1000, I should have 
replied ‘1002’.” And that I don’t doubt. This assumption is rather of the same 
kind as: “If he had fallen into the water then, I should have jumped in after 
him”.—Now, what was wrong with your idea? 


188 


Here I should first of all like to say: your idea was that that act of meaning 
the order had in its own way already traversed all those steps: that when you 
meant it your mind as it were flew ahead and took all the steps before you 
physically arrived at this or that one. 


Thus you were inclined to use such expressions as: “The steps are really 
already taken, even before I take them in writing or orally or in thought.” 


And it seemed as if they were in some unique way pre determined, 
anticipated—as only the act of meaning can anticipate reality. 


189 


“But are the steps then not determined by the algebraic formula?”—The 


question contains a mistake. 
We use the expression: “The steps are determined by the formula.”. 


How is it used?—-We may perhaps refer to the fact that people are brought by 
their education (training) so to use the formula y = x a, that they all work 
out the same? value for y when they substitute the same number for x. Or we 
may say: “These people are so trained that they all take the same step at the 
same point when they receive the order ‘add 3””. We might express this by 
saying: for these people the order “add 3” completely determines every step 
from one number to the next. (In contrast with other people who do not 
know what they are to do on receiving this order, or who react to it with 
perfect certainty, but each one in a different way.) 


In the other hand we can contrast different kinds of formula, and the 
different kinds of use (different kinds of training) appropriate to them. When 
we call formulae of a particular kind (with the appro priate methods of use) 
“formulae which determine a number y for a given value of x”, and formulae 
of another kind, ones which “do not determine the number y for a given 
value of x”. (Gj = x 2 would be of the first kind, y =/-x 2 of the second.) The 
proposition “The formula .... determines a number y” will then be a 
statement about the form of the formula—and now we must distinguish such 
a propo sition as “The formula which I have written down determines j”, or 
“Here is a formula which determines j”, from one of the following kind: “The 
formula j = x 2 determines the number j for a given value of x”. The 
question “Is the formula written down there one that determines j?” will then 
mean the same as “Is what is there a formula of this kind or that?”—but it is 
not clear off-hand what we are to make of the question “Is j = x 2 a formula 
which determines j for a given value of x?” One might address this question 
to a pupil in order to test whether he understands the use of the word “to 
deter mine”; or it might be a mathematical problem to prove in a particular 
system that x has only one square. 


190 


It may now be said: “The way the formula is meant determines which steps 
are to be taken”. That is the criterion for the way the formula is meant? It is, 
for example, the kind of way we always use it, the way we are taught to use 
it. 


We say, for instance, to someone who uses a sign unknown to us: “If by A 
you mean x 2, then you get this value for j 9 if you mean 2X, that one.”— 
Now ask yourself: how does one mean the one thing or the other by “xU”? 


That will be how meaning it can determine the steps in advance. 


191 


“Tt is as if we could grasp , the whole use of the word in a flash.” Like what 
e.g.?—Can’t the use—in a certain sense—be grasped in a flash? And in what 
sense can it not?—The point is, that it is as if we could ‘grasp it in a flash’ in 
yet another and much more direct sense than that.—But have you a model 
for this? No. It is just that this expression suggests itself to us. Is the result of 
the crossing of different pictures. 


192 


You have no model of this superlative fact, but you are seduced into using a 
super-expression. (It might be called a philo sophical superlative.) 


193 


The machine as symbolizing its action: the action of a machine—I might say 
at first—seems to be there in it from the start. That does that mean?—If we 
know the machine, everything else, that is its movement, seems to be already 
completely determined. 


We talk as if these parts could only move in this way, as if they could not do 
anything else. How is this—do we forget the possibility of their bending, 
breaking off, melting, and so on? Yes; in many cases we don’t think of that at 
all. We use a machine, or the drawing of a machine, to symbolize a particular 
action of the machine. For instance, we give someone such a drawing and 
assume that he will derive the movement of the parts from it. (Just as we can 
give someone a number by telling him that it is the twenty-fifth in the series 
i, 4, 9, 16, ... .) 


“The machine’s action seems to be in it from the start” means: we are 
inclined to compare the future movements of the machine in their 
definiteness to objects which are already lying in a drawer and which we 
then take out.-But we do not say this kind of thing when we are concerned 
with predicting the actual behaviour of a machine. When we do not in 
general forget the possibility of a distor tion of the parts and so on.-We do 
talk like that, however, when we are wondering at the way we can use a 
machine to symbolize a given way of moving—since it can also move in quite 
different ways. 


We might say that a machine, or the picture of it, is the first of a series of 
pictures which we have learnt to derive from this one. 


But when we reflect that the machine could also have moved dif ferently it 
may look as if the way it moves must be contained in the machine-as-symbol 
far more determinately than in the actual machine. Is if it were not enough 
for the movements in question to be empiric ally determined in advance, but 
they had to be really—in a mysterious sense—already present . And it is 
quite true: the movement of the machine-as-symbol is predetermined in a 
different sense from that in which the movement of any given actual machine 
is predetermined. 


194 


When does one have the thought: the possible movements of a machine are 
already there in it in some mysterious way?—Well, when one is doing 
philosophy. And what leads us into thinking that? The kind of way in which 
we talk about machines. We say, for example, that a machine has (possesses) 
such-and-such possibilities of move ment; we speak of the ideally rigid 
machine which can only move in such-and-such a way.-What is this 
possibility of movement? It is not the movement , but it does not seem to be 
the mere physical conditions for moving either—as, that there is play 
between socket and pin, the pin not fitting too tight in the socket. For while 
this is the empirical condition for movement, one could also imagine it to be 
otherwise. The possibility of a movement is, rather, supposed to be like a 
shadow of the movement itself. But do you know of such a shadow? And by a 
shadow I do not mean some picture of the movement—for such a picture 
would not have to be a picture of just this movement. But the possibility of 
this movement must be the possibility of just this movement. (See how high 
the seas of language run herel) 


The waves subside as soon as we ask ourselves: how do we use the phrase 
“possibility of movement” when we are talking about a given machine?-But 
then where did our queer ideas come from? 


Well, I shew you the possibility of a movement, say by means of a picture of 
the movement: ‘so possibility is something which is like reality’. We say: “It 
isn’t moving yet, but it already has the possibility of moving”-‘so possibility is 
something very near reality’. Though we may doubt whether such-and-such 
physical conditions make this movement possible, we never discuss whether 
this is the possibility of this or of that movement: ‘so the possibility of the 
movement stands in a unique relation to the movement itself; closer than that 


of a picture to its subject’; for it can be doubted whether a picture is the 


picture of this thing or that. We say “Experience will shew whether this gives 
the pin this possibility of movement”, but we do not say “Experience will 
shew whether this is the possibility of this move ment”: ‘50 it is not an 
empirical fact that this possibility is the possibility of precisely this 
movement’. 


We mind about the kind of expressions we use concerning these things; we 

do not understand them, however, but misinterpret them. When we do 
philosophy we are like savages, primitive people, who hear the expressions of 
civilized men, put a false interpretation on them, and then draw the queerest 
conclusions from it. 


195 


“But I don’t mean that what I do now (in grasping a sense) determines the 
future use causally and as a matter of experience, but that in a queer way, 
the use itself is in some sense present.”—But of course it is, ‘in some sense’! 
Really the only thing wrong with what you say is the expression “in a queer 
way”. The rest is all right; and the sentence only seems queer when one 
imagines a different language-game for it from the one in which we actually 
use it. (Someone once told me that as a child he had been surprised that a 
tailor could ‘sew a dress’—he thought this meant that a dress was produced 
by sewing alone, by sewing one thread on to another.) 


196 


In our failure to understand the use of a word we take it as the expression of 
a queer process. (As we think of time as a queer medium, of the mind asa 
queer kind of being.) 


197 


“Tt’s as if we could grasp the whole use of a word in a flash.”— And that is 
just what we say we do. That is to say: we sometimes describe what we do in 
these words. But there is nothing astonishing, nothing queer, about what 
happens. It becomes queer when we are led to think that the future 
development must in some way already be present in the act of grasping the 
use and yet isn’t present.—For we say that there isn’t any doubt that we 
understand the word, and on the other hand its meaning lies in its use. There 
is no doubt that I now. want to play chess, but chess is the game it is in 
virtue of all its rules (and so on). Don’t I know, then, which game I want to 
play until I have played it? or are all the rules contained in my act of 


intending? Is it experience that tells me that this sort of game is the usual 
conse quence of such an act of intending? so is it impossible for me to be 
certain what I am intending to do? And if that is nonsense—what kind of 
super-strong connexion exists between the act of intending and the thing 
intended?-Where is the connexion effected between the sense of the 
expression “Let’s play a game of chess” and all the rules of the game?—Well, 
in the list of rules of the game, in the teaching of it, in the day-to-day 
practice of playing. 


198 


“But how can a rule shew me what I have to do at this point? Whatever I do 
is, on some interpretation, in accord with the rule.”— That is not what we 
ought to say, but rather: any interpretation still hangs in the air along with 
what it interprets, and cannot give it any support. Interpretations by 
themselves do not determine mean ing. 


“Then can whatever I do be brought into accord with the rule?”— Let me ask 
this: what has the expression of a rule—say a sign-post— got to do with my 
actions? That sort of connexion is there here?— Well, perhaps this one: I 
have been trained to react to this sign in a particular way, and now I do so 
react to it. 


But that is only to give a causal connexion; to tell how it has come about that 
we now go by the sign-post; not what this going-by-the- sign really consists 
in. In the contrary; I have further indicated that a person goes by a sign-post 
only in so far as there exists a regular use of sign-posts, a custom. 


199 


Is what we call “obeying a rule” something that it would be possible for only 
one man to do, and to do only once in his life?— This is of course a note on 
the grammar of the expression “to obey a rule”. It is not possible that there 
should have been only one occasion on which someone obeyed a rule. It is 
not possible that there should have been only one occasion on which a report 
was made, an order given or understood; and so on.—To obey a rule, to 
make a report, to give an order, to play a game of chess, are custom (uses, 
institutions). 


To understand a sentence means to understand a language. To A understand 
a language means to be master of a technique. j 


200 


It is, of course, imaginable that two people belonging to a tribe unacquainted 
with games should sit at a chess-board and go through the moves of a game 
of chess; and even with all the appropriate mental accompaniments. And if 
we were to see it we should say they were playing chess. But now imagine a 
game of chess translated according to certain rules into a series of actions 
which we do not ordinarily associate with a game —say into yells and 
stamping of feet. And now suppose those two people to yell and stamp 
instead of play ing the form of chess that we are used to; and this in such a 
way that their procedure is translatable by suitable rules into a game of 
chess. Should we still be inclined to say they were playing a game? That right 
would one have to say so? 


201 


This was our paradox: no course’of action could be deter mined by a rule, 
because every course of action can be made out to accord with the rule. The 
answer was: if everything can be made out to accord with the rule, then it 
can also be made out to conflict with it. And so there would be neither 
accord nor conflict here. 


It can be seen that there is a misunderstanding here from the mere fact that 
in the course of our argument we give one interpretation after another; as if 
each one contented us at least for a moment, until we thought of yet another 
standing behind it. That this shews is that there is a way of grasping a rule 
which is not an interpretation, but which is exhibited in what we call 
“obeying the rule” and “going against it” in actual cases. 


Hence there is an inclination to say: every action according to the rule is an 
interpretation. But we ought to restrict the term “interpreta tion” to the 
substitution of one expression of the rule for another. 


202 


And hence also ‘obeying a rule” is a practice. And to think one is obeying a 
rule is not to obey a rule. Hence it is not possible to obey a rule ’privately’: 
otherwise thinking one was obeying a rule would be the same thing as 
obeying it. 


204 


Is things are I can, for example, invent a game that is never played by 
anyone.—But would the following be possible too: mankind has never played 
any games; once, however, someone invented a game —which no one ever 
played? . 


205 


“But it is just the queer thing about intention , about the mental process, that 
the existence of a custom, of a technique, is not necessary to it. That, for 
example, it is imaginable that two people should play chess in a world in 
which otherwise no games existed; and even that they should begin a game 
of chess—and then be interrupted.” 


But isn’t chess defined by its rules? And how are these rules present in the 
mind of the person who is intending to play chess? 


206 


Following a rule is analogous to obeying an order. We are trained to do so; 
we react to an order in a particular way. But what if one person reacts in one 
way and another in another to the order and the training? Which one is 
right? 


Suppose you came as an explorer into an unknown country with a language 
quite strange to you. In what circumstances would you say that the people 
there gave orders, understood them, obeyed them, rebelled against them, and 
so on? 


The common behaviour of mankind is the system of reference by means of 
which we interpret an unknown language. 


207 


Let us imagine that the people in that country carried on the usual human 
activities and in the course of them employed, apparently, an articulate 
language. Of we watch their behaviour we find it intelli gible, it seems 
‘logical’. But when we try to learn their language we find it impossible to do 
so. For there is no regular connexion between what they say, the sounds they 
make, and their actions; but still these sounds are not superfluous, for if we 
gag one of the people, it has the same consequences as with us; without the 
sounds their actions fall into confusion—as I feel like putting it. 


Are we to say that these people have a language: orders, reports, and the 
rest? 


There is not enough regularity for us to call it “language”. 


208 


When am I defining “order” and “rule” by means of “regularity”?—How do I 
explain the meaning of “regular”, “uniform”, “same” to anyone?—I shall 
explain these words to someone who, say, only speaks French by means of 
the corresponding French words. But if a person has not yet got the concepts 
, | shall teach him to use the words by means of examples and by practice .— 


And when I do this I do not communicate less to him than I know myself. 


In the course of this teaching I shall shew him the same colours, the same 
lengths, the same shapes, I shall make him find them and produce them, and 
so on. I shall, for instance, get him to continue an ornamental pattern 
uniformly when told to do so.—And also to continue progressions. And so, 
for example, when given:.to go on:. 


I do it, he does it after me; and I influence him by expressions of agreement, 
rejection, expectation, encouragement. I let him go his way, or hold him 
back; and so on. 


Imagine witnessing such teaching. One of the words would be explained by 
means of itself; there would be no logical circle. 


0 


The expressions “and so on”, “and so on ad infinitum” are also explained in 
this teaching. A gesture, among other things, might serve this purpose. The 
gesture that means “go on like this”, or “and so on” has a function 
comparable to that of pointing to an object or a place. 


We should distinguish between the “and so on” which is, and the “and so on” 
which is not, an abbreviated notation. “And so on ad inf.” is not such an 
abbreviation. The fact that we cannot write down all the digits of n is not a 
human shortcoming, as mathematicians sometimes think. 


Teaching which is not meant to apply to anything but the examples given is 
different from that which points beyond ’ them. 


209 


“But then doesn’t our understanding reach beyond all the examples?”—A 
very queer expression, and a quite natural one!— 


But is that all? Isn’t there a deeper explanation; or mustn’t at least the 
understanding of the explanation be deeper?—Well, have I myself a deeper 
understanding? Have I got more than I give in the explana tion?—But then, 
whence the feeling that I have got more? 


Is it like the case where I interpret what is not limited as a length that 
reaches beyond every length? 


210 


“But do you really explain to the other person what you yourself understand? 
Don’t you get him to guess the essential thing? You give him examples,—but 
he has to guess their drift, to guess your intention.”—Every explanation 
which I can give myself I give to him too.—“He guesses what I intend” would 
mean: various interpreta tions of my explanation come to his mind, and he 
lights on one of them. To in this case he could ask; and I could and should 
answer him. 


211 


How can he know how he is to continue a pattern by himself— 


whatever instruction you give him?—Well, how do I know?-If that means 
“Have I reasons?” the answer is: my reasons will soon give out. And then I 
shall act, without reasons. 


212 


When someone whom I am afraid of orders me to continue the series, I act 
quickly, with perfect certainty, and the lack of reasons does not trouble me. 


213 


“But this initial segment of a series obviously admitted of various 
interpretations (e.g. by means of algebraic expressions) and so you must first 
have chosen one such interpretation.”—Not at all. A doubt was possible in 
certain circumstances. But that is not to say that I did doubt, or even could 
doubt. (There is something to be said, which is connected with this, about 
the psychological ‘atmosphere’ of a process.) 


To it must have been intuition that removed this doubt?—If intuition is an 
inner voice—how do 1 know how I am to obey it? And how do I know that it 


doesn’t mislead me? For if it can guide me right, it can also guide me wrong. 


(intuition an unnecessary shuffle. )) 


214 


Of you have to have an intuition in order to develop the series ### 1234 .. 
you must also have one in order to develop the series ### 2222... 


215 


But isn’t the same at least the same? 


We seem to have an infallible paradigm of identity in the identity of a thing 
with itself. I feel like saying: “Here at any rate there can’t be a variety of 
interpretations. Of you are seeing a thing you are seeing identity too.” 


When are two things the same when they are what one thing is? And how am 
I to apply what the one thing shews me to the case of two things? 


216 


“A thing is identical with itself.”—There is no finer example of a useless 
proposition, which yet is connected with a certain play of the imagination. It 
is as if in imagination we put a thing into its own shape and saw that it 
fitted. 


We might also say: “Every thing fits into itself.” Or again: “Every thing fits 
into its own shape.” It the same time we look at a thing and imagine that 
there was a blank left for it, and that now it fits into it exactly. 


Does this spot ’fif into its white surrounding?— But that is just how it would 
look if there had at first been a hole in its place and it then fitted into the 
hole. But when we say “it fits” we are not simply describing this appearance; 
not simply this situation . 


“Every coloured patch fits exactly into its surrounding” is a rather specialized 
form of the law of identity. 


217 


“How am I able to obey a rule?”—f this is not a question about causes, then 


it is about the justification for my following the rule in the way I do. 


Of I have exhausted the justifications I have reached bedrock, and my spade 
is turned. When I am inclined to say: “This is simply what I do.” 


(Remember that we sometimes demand definitions for the sake not of their 
content, but of their form. Our requirement is an archi tectural one; the 
definition a kind of ornamental coping that supports nothing.) 


218 


Hence comes the idea that the beginning of a series is a visible section of 
rails invisibly laid to infinity? Well, we might imagine rails instead of a rule. 
And infinitely long rails correspond to the un limited application of a rule. 


219 


“All the steps are really already taken” means: I no longer have any choice. 
The rule, once stamped with a particular meaning, traces the lines along 
which it is to be followed through the whole of space.-But if something of 
this sort really were the case, how would it help? 


No; my description only made sense if* it was to be understood symbolically. 
—I should have said: This is how it strikes me . 


When I obey a rule, I do not choose. 


I obey the rule blindly. 


220 


But what is the purpose of that symbolical proposition? It was supposed to 
bring into prominence a difference between being causally determined and 
being logically determined. 


221 


By symbolical expression was really a mythological descrip tion of the use of 
a rule. This is of course only a picture. And if I judged that it intimated this 
or that as it were irresponsibly, I should not say that I was obeying it like a 
rule. 


223 


One does not feel that one has always got to wait upon the nod (the whisper) 
of the rule. In the contrary, we are not on tenter hooks about what it will tell 
us next, but it always tells us the same, and we do what it tells us. 


One might say to the person one was training: “Look, I always do the same 


thing: I.” 


224 


The word “agreement” and the word “rule” are related to one another, they 
are cousins. Of I teach anyone the use of the one word, he learns the use of 
the other with it. 


225 


The use of the word “rule” and the use of the word “same” are. interwoven. 
(As are the use of “proposition” and the use of “true”.) 


226 


Suppose someone gets the series of numbers 1, 3,5, 7,.... by working out the 
series ix + i 1. And now he asks himself: “But am,I always doing the same 
thing, or something different every time?” 


Of from one day to the next you promise: “To-morrow I will come and see 
you”—are you saying the same thing every day, or every day something 
different? 


227 


Would it make sense to say “If he did something different every day we 
should not say he was obeying a rule”? That makes no sense. 


228 


“We see a series in just one way!”—All right, but what is that way? Clearly 
we see it algebraically, and as a segment of an expansion. Or is there more in 
it than that?—“But the way we see it surely gives us everything!”—But that 
is not an observation about the segment of the series; or about anything that 


we notice in it; it gives expression to the fact that we look to the rule for 
instruction and do something, without appealing to anything else for 
guidance.

I believe that I perceive something drawn very fine in a segment of a series, a 
characteristic design, which only needs the addition of “and so on”, in order 
to reach to infinity. 


230 


“The line intimates to me which way I am to go” is only a paraphrase of: it is 
my last arbiter for the way I am to go. 


231 


“But surely you can see ....?” That is just the characteristic expression of 
someone who is under the compulsion of a rule. 


232 


Let us imagine a rule intimating to me which way I am to obey it; that is, as 
my eye travels along the line, a voice within me says: “This wayl”—What is 
the difference between this process of obeying a kind of inspiration and that 
of obeying a rule? For they are surely not the same. In the case of inspiration 
I await direction. I shall not j be able to teach anyone else my ‘technique’ of 
following the line. ! Unless, indeed, I teach him some way of hearkening, 
some kind of receptivity. But then, of course, I cannot require him to follow 
the line in the same way as I do. 


These are not my experiences of acting from inspiration and accord ing to a 
rule; they are grammatical notes. 


253 


It would also be possible to imagine such a training in a sort of arithmetic. 
Children could calculate, each in his own way—as long as they listened to 
their inner voice and obeyed it. Calculating in this way would be like a sort 
of composing. 


234 


Would it not be possible for us, however, to calculate as we actually do (all 
agreeing, and so on), and still at every step to have a feeling of being guided 
by the rules as by a spell, feeling astonishment at the fact that we agreed? 
(We might give thanks to the Deity for our j agreement.) 


235 


This merely shews what goes to make up what we call “obeying a rule” in 
everyday life. 


236 


Calculating prodigies who get the right answer but cannot say how. Are we 
to say that they do not calculate? (A family of cases.) 


237 


Imagine someone using a line as a rule in the following way: he holds a pair 
of compasses, and carries one of its points along the line that is the ‘rule’, 
while the other one draws the line that follows the rule. And while he moves 
along the ruling line he alters the open ing of the compasses, apparently with 
great precision, looking at the rule the whole time as if it determined what 
he did. And watching him we see no kind of regularity in this opening and 
shutting of the com passes. We cannot learn his way of following the line 
from it. Here perhaps one really would say: “The original seems to intimate 
to him which way he is to go. But it is not a rule.” 


238 


The rule can only seem to me to produce all its consequences in advance if I 
draw them as a matter of course . Is much as it is a matter of course for me to 
call this colour “blue”. (Criteria for the fact that something is ‘a matter of 
course’ for me.) 


239 


How is he to know what colour he is to pick out when he hears “red”?— 
Quite simple: he is to take the colour whose image occurs to him when he 
hears the word.—But how is he to know which colour it is ‘whose image 


occurs to him’? Is a further criterion needed for that? (There is indeed such a 
procedure as choosing the colour which occurs to one when one hears the 
word 


“Red’ means the colour that occurs to me when I hear the word ‘red’”— 
would be a definition . Not an explanation of what it is to use a word as a 
name. 


240 


Disputes do not break out (among mathematicians, say) over the question 
whether a rule has been obeyed or not. People don’t come to blows over it, 
for example. That is part of the framework on which the working of our 
language is based (for example, in giving descriptions). 


241 


“So you are saying that human agreement decides what is true and what is 
false?”—It is what human beings say that is true and false; and they agree in 
the language they use. That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life. 


242 


Of language is to be a means of communication there must be agreement not 
only in definitions but also (queer as this may sound) in judgments. This 
seems to abolish logic, but does not do so.— It is one thing to describe 
methods of measurement, and another to obtain and state results of 
measurement. But what we call “measuring” is partly determined by a 
certain constancy in results of measurement. 


243 


A human being can encourage himself, give himself orders, obey, blame and 
punish himself; he can ask himself a question and answer it. We could even 
imagine human beings who spoke only in monologue; who accompanied 
their activities by talking to themselves. —An explorer who watched them 
and listened to their talk might succeed in translating their language into 
ours. (This would enable him to predict these people’s actions correctly, for 
he also hears them making resolutions and decisions.) 


But could we also imagine a language in which a person could write down or 
give vocal expression to his inner experiences—his feelings, 


moods, and the rest—for his private use?-Well, can’t we do so in our ordinary 
language?—But that is not what I mean. The individual words of this 
language are to refer to what can only be known to the person speaking; to 
his immediate private sensations. To another person cannot understand the 
language. 


244 


How do words refer to sensations?—There doesn’t seem to be any problem 
here; don’t we talk about sensations every day, and give them names? But 
how is the connexion between the name and the thing named set up? This 
question is the same as: how does a human being learn the meaning of the 
names of sensations?—of the word “pain” for example. Here is one 
possibility: words are connected with the primitive, the natural, expressions 
of the sensation and used in their place. A child has hurt himself and he cries; 
and then adults talk to him and teach him exclamations and, later, sentences. 
They teach the child new pain-behaviour. 


“So you are saying that the word ‘pain’ really means crying?”— In the 
contrary: the verbal expression of pain replaces crying and does not describe 
it. 


245 


For how can I go so far as to try to use language to get between pain and its 
expression? 


246 


In what sense are my sensations private ?—Well, only I can know whether I 
am really in pain; another person can only surmise it.—In one way this is 
wrong, and in another nonsense. Of we are using the word “to know” as it is 
normally used (and how else are we to use it?), then other people very often 
know when I am in pain.— Yes, but all the same not with the certainty with 
which I know it myself 1 —It can’t be said of me at all (except perhaps as a 
joke) that I know I am in pain. That is it supposed to mean—except perhaps 
that I am in pain? 


Other people cannot be said to learn of my sensations only from my 
behaviour,—for I cannot be said to learn of them. I have them. 


The truth is: it makes sense to say about other people that they doubt 


whether I am in pain; but not to say it about myself. 


247 


“Only you can know if you had that intention.” One might tell someone this 
when one was explaining the meaning of the word “intention” to him. For 
then it means: that is how we use it. 


(And here “know” means that the expression of uncertainty is senseless.) 


248 


The proposition “Sensations are private” is comparable to: “One plays 
patience by oneself”. 


249 


Are we perhaps over-hasty in our assumption that the smile of an unweaned 
infant is not a pretence?—And on what experience is our assumption based? 


(Lying is a language-game that needs to be learned like any other one.) 


250 


Why can’t a dog simulate pain? Is he too honest? Would one teach a dog to 
simulate pain? Perhaps it is possible to teach him to howl on particular 
occasions as if he were in pain, even when he is not. But the surroundings 
which are necessary for this behaviour to be real simulation are missing. 


251 


That does it mean when we say: “I can’t imagine the opposite of this” or 
“What would it be like, if it were otherwise?”—For example, when someone 
has said that my images are private, or that only I myself can know whether I 
am feeling pain, and similar things. 


Of course, here “I can’t imagine the opposite” doesn’t mean: my powers of 
imagination are unequal to the task. These words are a defence against 
something whose form makes it look like an empirical proposition, but which 
is really a grammatical one. 


But why do we say: “I can’t imagine the opposite”? Why not: “I can’t imagine 
the thing itself”? 


Example: “Every rod has a length.” That means something like: we call 
something (or this) “the length of a rod”—but nothing “the length of a 
sphere.” How can I imagine ‘every rod having a length’? Well, I simply 
imagine a rod. Only this picture, in connexion with this proposition, has a 
quite different role from one used in connexion with the proposition “This 
table has the same length as the one over there”. For here I understand what 
it means to have a picture of the opposite (nor need it be a mental picture). 


But the picture attaching to the grammatical proposition could only shew, 
say, what is called “the length of a rod”. And what should the opposite 
picture be? 


((Remark about the negation of an a priori proposition.)) 


252 


“This body has extension.” To this we might reply: “Non sense!”—but are 
inclined to reply “Of course!”—Why is this? 


253 


“Another person can’t have my pains.”—Which are my pains? That counts as 
a criterion of identity here? Consider what makes it possible in the case of 
physical objects to speak of “two exactly the same”, for example, to say “This 
chair is not the one you saw here yesterday, but is exactly the same as it”. 


In so far as it makes sense to say that my pain is the same as his, it is also 
possible for us both to have the same pain. (And it would also be imaginable 
for two people to feel pain in the same—not just the corresponding—place. 
That might be the case with Siamese twins, for instance.) 


I have seen a person in a discussion on this subject strike himself on the 
breast and say: “But surely another person can’t have THIS painl”—The 
answer to this is that one does not define a criterion of identity by emphatic 
stressing of the word “this”. Rather, what the emphasis does is to suggest the 
case in which we are conversant with such a criterion of identity, but have to 
be reminded of it. 


254 


The substitution of “identical” for “the same” (for instance) is another typical 
expedient in philosophy. Is if we were talking about shades of meaning and 
all that were in question were to find words to hit on the correct nuance. 
That is in question in philosophy only wherewe have to give a 
psychologically exact account of the temptation to use a particular kind of 
expression. That we ‘are tempted to say’ in such a case is, of course, not 
philosophy; but it is its raw material. Thus, for example, what a 
mathematician is inclined to say about the objectivity and reality of 
mathematical facts, is not a philosophy of mathematics, but something for 
philosophical treatment . 


255 


The philosopher’s treatment of a question is like the treatment of an illness. 


256 


Now, what about the language which describes my inner experiences and 
which only I myself can understand? How do I use words to stand for my 
sensations?—As we ordinarily do? When are my words for sensations tied up 
with my natural expressions of sensation? In that case my language is not a 
‘private’ one. Someone else might understand it as well as I.—But suppose I 
didn’t have any natural expression for the sensation, but only had the 
sensation? And now I simply associate names with sensations and use these 
names in descriptions.— 


257 


“What would it be like if human beings shewed no outward signs of pain (did 
not groan, grimace, etc.)? When it would be impos sible to teach a child the 
use of the word ‘tooth-ache’.”—Well, let’s assume the child is a genius and 
itself invents a name for the sensation 1 —But then, of course, he couldn’t 
make himself understood when he used the word.—So does he understand 
the name, without being able to explain its meaning to anyone?—But what 
does it mean to say that he has ‘named his pain’?—How has he done this 
naming of pain?! And whatever he did, what was its purpose?—When one 
says “He gave a name to his sensation” one forgets that a great deal of stage 
setting in the language is presupposed if the mere act of naming is to make 
sense. And when we speak of someone’s having given a name to pain, what is 
presupposed is the existence of the grammar of the word “pain”; it shews the 
post where the new word is stationed. 


258 


Let us imagine the following case. I want to keep a diary about the 
recurrence of a certain sensation. To this end I associate it with the sign “S” 
and write this sign in a calendar for every day on which I have the 
sensation.-1 will remark first of all that a definition of the sign cannot be 
formulated.—But still I can give myself a kind of ostensive definition.—How? 
Can I point to the sensation? Not in the ordinary sense. But I speak, or write 
the sign down, and at the same time I concentrate my attention on the 
sensation—and so, as it were, point to it inwardly.—But what is this 
ceremony for? for that is all it seems to be! A definition surely serves to 
establish the meaning of a sign.—Well, that is done precisely by the 
concentra ting of my attention; for in this way I impress on myself the 
connexion between the sign and the sensation.—But “I impress it on myself” 
can only mean: this process brings it about that I remember the connexion 
right in the future. But in the present case I have no criterion of correctness. 
One would like to say: whatever is going to seem right to me is right. And 
that only means that here we can’t talk about ‘right’. 


259 


Are the rules of the private language impressions of rules?— The balance on 
which impressions are weighed is not the impression of a balance. 


260 


“Well, I believe that this is the sensation A again.”—Perhaps you believe that 
you believe it I 


When did the man who made the entry in the calendar make a note of 
nothing whatever}— Don’t consider it a matter of course that a person is 
making a note of something when he makes a mark—say in a calendar. For a 
note has a function, and this “S” so far has none. 


(One can talk to oneself.—If a person speaks when no one else is present, 
does that mean he is speaking to himself?) 


261 


That reason have we for calling “S” the sign for a sensation ? For “sensation” 
is a word of our common language, not of one intel ligible to me alone. To 
the use of this word stands in need of a justifica tion which everybody 


understands.—And it would not help either to say that it need not be a 
sensation ; that when he writes “S”, he has something —and that is all that 
can be said. “Has” and “something” also belong to our common language.— 
So in the end when one is doing philosophy one gets to the point where one 
would like just to emit an inarticulate sound.—But such a sound is an 
expression only as it occurs in a particular language-game, which should now 
be described. 


262 


It might be said: if you have given yourself a private definition of a word, 
then you must inwardly undertake to use the word in such- and-such away. 
And how do you undertake that? Is it to be assumed that you invent the 
technique of using the word; or that you found it ready-made? 


263 


“But I can (inwardly) undertake to call THIS ‘pain’ in the future.”—“But is it 
certain that you have undertaken it? Are you sure that it was enough for this 
purpose to concentrate your attention on your feeling?”—-A queer question.— 


264 


“Once you know what the word stands for, you understand it, you know its 
whole use.” 


265 


Let us imagine a table (something like a dictionary) that exists only in our 
imagination. A dictionary can be used to justify the translation of a word A 
by a word Y. But are we also to call it a justification if such a table is to be 
looked up only in the imagination? —“Well, yes; then it is a subjective 
justification.”—But justification consists in appealing to something 
independent.—“But surely I can appeal from one memory to another. For 
example, I don’t know if I have remembered the time of departure of a train 
right and to check it I call to mind how a page of the time-table looked. Isn’t 
it the same here?”—No; for this process has got to produce a memory which 
is actually correct Of the mental image of the time-table could not itself be 
tested for correctness, how could it confirm the correctness of the first 
memory? (As if someone were to buy several copies of the morn ing paper to 
assure himself that what it said was true.) 


Looking up a table in the imagination is no more looking up a table than the 
image of the result of an imagined experiment is the result of an experiment. 


266 


I can look at the clock to see what time it is: but I can also look at the dial of 
a clock in order to guess what time it is; or for the same purpose move the 
hand of a clock till its position strikes me as right. To the look of a clock may 
serve to determine the time in more than one way. (Looking at the clock in 
imagination.) 


267 


Suppose I wanted to justify the choice of dimensions for a bridge which I 
imagine to be building, by making loading tests on the material of the bridge 
in my imagination. This would, of course, be to imagine what is called 
justifying the choice of dimensions for a bridge. But should we also call it 
justifying an imagined choice of dimensions? 


268 


Why can’t my right hand give my left hand money?—My right hand can put 
it into my left hand. By right hand can write a deed of gift and my left hand a 
receipt.—But the further practical consequences would not be those of a gift. 
When the left hand has taken the money from the right, etc., we shall ask: 
“Well, and what of it?” And the same could be asked if a person had given 
himself a private definition of a word; I mean, if he has said the word to 
himself and at the same time has directed his attention to a sensation. 


269 


Let us remember that there are certain criteria in a man’s behaviour for the 
fact that he does not understand a word: that it means nothing to him, that 
he can do nothing with it. And criteria for his ‘thinking he understands’, 
attaching some meaning to the word, but not the right one. And, lastly, 
criteria for his understanding the word right. In the second case one might 
speak of a subjective under standing. And sounds which no one else 
understands but which I ‘appear to understand’ might be called a “private 
language”. 


270 


Let us now imagine a use for the entry of the sign “S” in my diary. I discover 
that whenever I have a particular sensation a manometer shews that my 
blood-pressure rises. To I shall be able to say that my blood-pressure is rising 
without using any apparatus. This is a useful result. And now it seems quite 
indifferent whether I have recognized the sensation right or not. Let us 
suppose I regularly identify it wrong, it does not matter in the least. And that 
alone shews that the hypothesis that I make a mistake is mere show. (We as 
it were turned a knob which looked as if it could be used to turn on some 
part of the machine; but it was a mere ornament, not connected with the 
mechanism at all.) 


And what is our reason for calling “S” the name of a sensation here? 
Perhaps the kind of way this sign is employed in this language-game._ 


And why a “particular sensation,” that is, the same one every time? Well, 
aren’t we supposing that we write “S” every time? 


271 


“Imagine a person whose memory could not retain what the word ‘pain’ 
meant—so that he constantly called different things by that name—but 
nevertheless used the word in a way fitting in with the usual symptoms and 
presuppositions of pain”—in short he uses it as we all do. Here I should like 
to say: a wheel that can be turned though nothing else moves with it, is not 
part of the mer-hankm 


27 2 


The essential thing about private experience is really not that each person 
possesses his own exemplar, but that nobody knows whether other people 
also have this or something else. The assumption would thus be possible— 
though unverifiable—that one section of mankind had one sensation of red 
and another section another. 


273 


That am I to say about the word “red”?—that it means some thing 
‘confronting us all’ and that everyone should really have another word, 
besides this one, to mean his own sensation of red? Or is it like this: the word 
“red” means something known to everyone; and in addition, for each person, 
it means something known only to him? (Or perhaps rather: it refers to 


something known only to him.) 


274 


Of course, saying that the word “red” “refers to” instead of “means” 
something private does not help us in the least to grasp its function; but it is 
the more psychologically apt expression for a par ticular experience in doing 
philosophy. It is as if when I uttered the word I cast a sidelong glance at the 
private sensation, as it were in order to say to myself: I know all right what I 
mean by it. 


275 


Look at the blue of the sky and say to yourself “How blue the sky is!”—When 
you do it spontaneously—without philosophical intentions—the idea never 
crosses your mind that this impression of colour belongs only to you. And 
you have no hesitation in exclaiming that to someone else. And if you point 
at anything as you say the words you point at the sky. I am saying: you have 
not the feeling of pointing-into-yourself, which often accompanies ‘naming 
the sensa tion’ when one is thinking about ‘private language’. For do you 
think that really you ought not to point to the colour with your hand, but 
with your attention. (Consider what it means “to point to something with the 
attention”.) 


276 


But don’t we at least mean something quite definite when we look at a colour 
and name our colour-impression? It is as if we detached the colour - 
impression from the object, like a membrane. (This ought to arouse our 
suspicions.) 


277 


But how is even possible for us to be tempted to think that we use a word to 
mean at one time the colour known to everyone—and at another the ‘visual 
impression’ which I am getting nowi How can there be so much as a 
temptation here?-1 don’t turn the same kind of attention on the colour in the 
two cases. When I mean the colour impression that (as I should like to say) 
belongs to me alone I immerse myself in the colour—rather like when I 
‘cannot get my fill of a colour’. Hence it is easier to produce this experience 
when one is looking at a bright colour, or at an impressive colour-scheme. 


278 


“T know how the colour green looks to me”—surely that makes sense!— 
Certainly: what use of the proposition are you thinking of? 


279 


Imagine someone saying: “But I know how tall I am!” and laying his hand on 
top of his head to prove it. 


280 


Someone paints a picture in order to shew how he imagines a theatre scene. 
And now I say: “This picture has a double function: 


it informs others, as pictures or words inform-but for the one who gives the 
information it is a representation (or piece of informa tion?) of another kind: 
for him it is the picture of his image, as it can’t be for anyone else. To him his 
private impression of the picture means what he has imagined, in a sense in 
which the picture cannot mean this to others.”—And what right have I to 
speak in this second case of a representation or piece of information—if these 
words were rightly used in the first case? 


281 


“But doesn’t what you say come to this: that there is no pain, for example, 
without pain-behaviour}’ ’—It comes to this: only of a living human being 
and what resembles (behaves like) a living human being can one say: it has 
sensations; it sees; is blind; hears; is deaf; is conscious or unconscious. 


282 


“But in a fairy tale the pot too can see and hear!” (Certainly; but it can also 
talk.) 


“But the fairy tale only invents what is not the case: it does not talk nonsense 
—It is not as simple as that. Is it false or nonsensical to say that a pot talks? 
Have we a clear picture of the circumstances in which we should say of a pot 
that it talked? (Even a nonsense-poem is not nonsense in the same way as the 
babbling of a child.) 


We do indeed say of an inanimate thing that it is in pain: when play ing with 


dolls for example. But this use of the concept of pain is a secondary one. 
Imagine a case in which people ascribed pain only to inanimate things; pitied 
only dolls! (When children play at trains their game is connected with their 
knowledge of trains. It would neverthe less be possible for the children of a 
tribe unacquainted with trains to learn this game from others, and to play it 
without knowing that it was copied from anything. One might say that the 
game did not make the same sense to them as to us.) 


283 


That gives us so much as the idea that living beings, things, can feel? 


Is it that my education has led me to it by drawing my attention to feelings in 
myself, and now I transfer the idea to objects outside myself? That I 
recognize that there is something there (in me) which I can call “pain” 
without getting into conflict with the way other people use this word?—I do 
not transfer my idea to stones, plants, etc. 


Couldn’t I imagine having frightful pains and turning to stone while they 
lasted? Well, how do I know, if I shut my eyes, whether I have not turned 
into a stone? And if that has happened, in what sense will the stone have the 
pains? In what sense will they be ascribable to the stone? And why need the 
pain have a bearer at all here?! 


And can one say of the stone that it has a soul and that is what has the pain? 
That has a soul, or pain, to do with a stone? 


Only of what behaves like a human being ean one say that it has pains. 


For one has to say it of a body, or, if you like of a soul which some body has. 
And how can a body have a soul? 


284 


Look at a stone and imagine it having sensations.—One says to oneself: How 
could one so much as get the idea of ascribing a sensation to a thing? One 
might as well ascribe it to a number!—And now look at a wriggling fly and at 
once these difficulties vanish and pain seems able to get a foothold here, 
where before everything was, so to speak, too smooth for it. 


And so, too, a corpse seems to us quite inaccessible to pain.—Our attitude to 
what is alive and to what is dead, is not the same. All our reactions are 
different.—If anyone says: “That cannot simply come from the fact that a 


living thing moves about in such-and-such a way and a dead one not”, then I 
want to intimate to him that this is a case of the transition ‘from quantity to 
quality’. 


285 


Think of the recognition of facial expressions. Or of the description of facial 
expressions—which does not consist in giving the measurements of the face! 
Think, too, how one can imitate a man’s face without seeing one’s own in a 

mirror. 


286 


But isn’t it absurd to say of a body that it has pain?-And why does one feel an 
absurdity in that? In what sense is it true that my hand does not feel pain, 
but I in my hand? 


That sort of issue is: Is it the body that feels pain?—How is it to be decided? 
That makes it plausible to say that it is not the body?— Well, something like 
this: if someone has a pain in his hand, then the hand does not say so (unless 
it writes it) and one does not comfort the hand, but the sufferer: one looks 
into his face. 


287 


How am I filled with pity for this marii How does it come out what the object 
of my pity is? (Pity, one may say, is a form of conviction that someone else is 
in pain.) 


288 


I turn to stone and my pain goes on.—Suppose I were in error and it was no 
longer pain ?-But I can’t be in error here; 


it means nothing to doubt whether I am in pain!—That means: if anyone said 
“I do not know if what I have got is a pain or something else”, we should 
think something like, he does not know what the 


English word “pain” means; and we should explain it to him.—How? Perhaps 
by means of gestures, or by pricking him with a pin and saying: “See, that’s 
what pain is!” This explanation, like any other, he might understand right, 
wrong, or not at all. And he will shew which he does by his use of the word, 


in this as in other cases. 


Of he now said, for example: “Oh, I know what ‘pain’ means; what I don’t 
know is whether this, that 1 have now, is pain’—we should merely shake our 
heads and be forced to regard his words as a queer reaction which we have 
no idea what to do with. (It would be rather as if we heard someone say 
seriously: “I distinctly remember that some time before I was born I 
believed.”.) 


That expression of doubt has no place in the language-game; but if we cut 
out human behaviour, which is the expression of sensation, it looks as if I 
might legitimately begin to doubt afresh. By temptation to say that one might 
take a sensation for something other than what it is arises from this: if I 
assume the abrogation of the normal language- game with the expression of a 
sensation, I need a criterion of identity for the sensation; and then the 
possibility of error also exists. 


289 


“When I say ‘I am in pain’ I am at any rate justified before myself’—What 
does that mean? Does it mean: “If someone else could know what I am 
calling ‘pain’, he would admit that I was using the word correctly”? 


To use a word without a justification does not mean to use it without right. 


290 


That I do is not, of course, to identify my sensation by criteria: but to repeat 
an expression. But this is not the end of the language-game: it is the 
beginning. 


But isn’t the beginning the sensation—which I describe?—Perhaps this word 
“describe” tricks us here. I say “I describe my state of mind” and “I describe 
my room”. You need to call to mind the differences between the language- 
games. 


291 


That we call ” descriptions ” are instruments for particular uses. Think of a 
machine-drawing, a cross-section, an elevation with measurements, which an 
engineer has before him. Thinking of a description as a word-picture of the 
facts has something misleading about it: one tends to think only of such 


pictures as hang on our walls: which seem simply to portray how a thing 
looks, what it is like. (These pictures are as it were idle.) 


292 


Don’t always think that you read off what you say from the facts; that you 
portray these in words according to rules. For even so you would have to 
apply the rule in the particular case without guidance. 


293 


Of I say of myself that it is only from my own case that I know what the 
word “pain” means—must I not say the same of other people too? And how 
can I generalize the one case so irresponsibly? 


How someone tells me that he knows what pain is only from his own can el- 
Suppose everyone had a box with something in it: we call it a “beetle”. To 
one can look into anyone else’s box, and everyone says he knows what a 
beetle is only by looking at his beetle.-—Here it would be quite possible for 
everyone to have something different in his box. One might even imagine 
such a thing constantly changing.—But suppose the word “beetle” had a use 
in these people’s language?—If so it would not be used as the name of a 
thing. The thing in the box has no place in the language-game at all; not even 
as a something: for the box might even be empty.—No, one can ‘divide 
through’ by the thing in the box; it cancels out, whatever it is. 


That is to say: if we construe the grammar of the expression of sensation on 
the model of ‘object and designation’ the object drops out of consideration as 
irrelevant. 


294 


Of you say he sees a private picture before him, which he is describing, you 
have still made an assumption about what he has before him- And that 
means that you can describe it or do describe it more closely. Of you admit 
that you haven’t any notion what kind of thing it mi ght be that he has 
before him—then what leads you into saying, in spite of that, that he has 
something before him? Isn’t it as if I were to say of someone: “He has 
something. But I don’t know whether it is money, or debts, or an empty till.” 


295 


“T know only from my own case”—what kind of proposition is this meant to 
be at all? In experiential one? No.—A grammatical one? 


Suppose everyone does say about himself that he knows what pain is only 
from his own pain.—Not that people really say that, or are even prepared to 
say it. But if everybody said it-it might be a kind of exclamation. And even if 
it gives no information, still it is a picture, and why should we not want to 
call up such a picture? Imagine an allegorical painting take the place of those 
words. 


When we look into ourselves as we do philosophy, we often get to see just 
such a picture. A full-blown pictorial representation of our grammar. Not 
facts; but as it were illustrated turns of speech. 


296 


“Yes, but there is something there all the same accompanying my cry of pain. 
And it is on account of that that I utter it. And this something is what is 
important—and frightful.”—Only whom are we informing of this? And on 
what occasion? 


297 


Of course, if water boils in a pot, steam comes out of the pot and also 
pictured steam comes out of the pictured pot. But what if one insisted on 
saying that there must also be something boiling in the picture of the pot? 


298 


The very fact that we should so much like to say: “This is the important 
thing”—while we point privately to the sensation— is enough to shew how 
much we are inclined to say something which gives no information. 


299 


Being unable—when we surrender ourselves to philosophical thought—to 
help saying such-and-such; being irresistibly inclined to say it—does not 
mean being forced into an assumption , or having an immediate perception 
or knowledge of a state of affairs. 


300 


It is—we should like to say—not merely the picture of the behaviour that 
plays a part in the language-game with the words “he is in pain”, but also the 
picture of the pain. Or, not merely the para digm of the behaviour, but also 
that of the pain.—It is a misunder standing to say “The picture of pain enters 
into the language-game with the word ‘pain’.” The image of pain is not a 
picture and this image is not replaceable in the language-game by anything 
that we should call a picture.—The image of pain certainly enters into the 
language game in a sense; only not as a picture. 


301 


In image is not a picture, but a picture can correspond to it. 


302 


Of one has to imagine someone else’s pain on the model of one’s own, this is 
none too easy a thing to do: for I have to imagine pain which I do not feel on 
the model of the pain which I do feel. That is, what I have to do is not simply 
to make a transition in imagination from one place of pain to another. As, 
from pain in the hand to pain in the arm. For I am not to imagine that I feel 
pain in some region of his body. (Which would also be possible.) 


Pain-behaviour can point to a painful place—but the subject of pain is the 
person who gives it expression. 


102 


if I am.”—Yes: one can make the decision to say “I believe he is in pain” 
instead of “He is in pain”. But that is all.-What looks like an explanation here, 
or like a statement about a mental process, is in truth an exchange of one 
expression for another which, while we are doing philosophy, seems the 
more appropriate one. 


Must try—in a real case—to doubt someone else’s fear or pain. 


304 


“But you will surely admit that there is a difference between pain-behaviour 
accompanied by pain and pain-behaviour without any pain?”—Admit it? 
That greater difference could there be?—“And yet you again and again reach 
the conclusion that the sensation itself is a nothing” —Not at all. It is not a 
somethings but not a nothing either! The conclusion was only that a nothing 


would serve just as well as a something about which nothing could be said. 
We have only rejected the grammar which tries to force itself on us here. 


The paradox disappears only if we make a radical break with the idea~that 
language always functions in one way, always serves the same purpose: to 
convey thoughts—which may be about houses, pains, good and evil, or 
anything else you please. 


305 


“But you surely cannot deny that, for example, in remember ing, an inner 
process takes place.”—-What gives the impression that we want to deny 
anything? When one says “Still, an inner process does take place here”—one 
wants to go on: “After all, you see it.” And it is this inner process that one 
means by the word “remember ing”.—The impression that we wanted to 
deny something arises from our setting our faces against the picture of the 
‘inner process’. That we deny is that the picture of the inner process gives us 
the correct idea of the use of the word “to remember”. We say that this 
picture with its ramifications stands in the way of our seeing the use of the 
word as it is. 


306 


Why should I deny that there is a mental process? But “There has just taken 
plac£ in me the mental process of remember ing... .” means nothing more 
than: “I have just remembered ... .”. To deny the mental process would 
mean to deny the remembering; to deny that anyone ever remembers 
anything. 


307 


“Are you not really a behaviourist in disguise? Aren’t you at bottom really 
saying that everything except human behaviour is a fiction?”—If I do speak 
of a fiction, then it is of a grammatical fiction. 


508 


How does the philosophical problem about mental processes and states and 
about behaviourism arise?-The first step is the one that altogether escapes 
notice. We talk of processes and states and leave their nature undecided. 
Sometime perhaps we shall know more about them—we think. But that is 


just what commits us to a particular way of looking at the matter. For we 
have a definite concept of what it means to learn to know a process better. 
(The decisive movement in the conjuring trick has been made, and it was the 
very one that we thought quite innocent.)—And now the analogy which was 
to make us understand our thoughts falls to pieces. To we have to deny the 
yet uncomprehended process in the yet unexplored medium. And now it 
looks as if we had denied mental processes. And naturally we don’t want to 
deny them. 


309 


That is your aim in philosophy?—To shew the fly the way out of the fly- 
bottle. 


310 


I tell someone I am in pain. Is attitude to me will then be that of belief; 
disbelief; suspicion; and so on. 


Let us assume he says: “It’s not so bad.”—Doesn’t that prove that he believes 
in something behind the outward expression of pain?- 


Is attitude is a proof of his attitude. Imagine not merely the words “I am in 
pain” but also the answer “It’s not so bad” replaced by instinctive noises and 
gestures. 


311 


“What difference could be greater?”—In the case of pain I believe that I can 
give myself a private exhibition of the difference. But I can give anyone an 
exhibition of the difference between a broken and an unbroken tooth.—But 
for the private exhibition you don’t have to give yourself actual pain; it is 
enough to imagine it—for instance, you screw up your face a bit. And do you 
know that what you are giving yourself this exhibition of is pain and not, for 
example, a facial expression? And how do you know what you are to give 
yourself an exhibition of before you do it? This private exhibition is an 
illusion. 


312 


But again, areiit the cases of the tooth and the pain similar? For the visual 
sensation in the one corresponds to the sensation of pain in the other. I can 


exhibit the visual sensation to myself as little or as well as the sensation of 
pain. 


Let us imagine the following: The surfaces of the things around us (stones, 
plants, etc.) have patches and regions which produce pain in our skin when 
we touch them. (Perhaps through the chemical composition of these surfaces. 
But we need not know that.) In this case we should speak of pain-patches on 
the leaf of a particular plant just as at present we speak of red patches. I am 
supposing that it is useful to us to notice these patches and their shapes; that 
we can infer important properties of the objects from them. 


313 


I can exhibit pain, as I exhibit red, and as I exhibit straight and crooked and 
trees and stones .—That is what we call “exhibiting”. 


314 


It shews a fundamental misunderstanding, if I am inclined to study the 
headache I have now in order to get clear about the philo sophical problem 
of sensation. 


315 


Would someone understand the word “pain”, who had never felt pain?—Is 
experience to teach me whether this is so or not?— And if we say “A man 
could not imagine pain without having some time felt it’—how do we know? 
How can it_be decided whether it is true? 


316 


In order to get clear about the meaning of the word “think” we watch 
ourselves while we think; what we observe will be what the word means !— 
But this concept is not used like that. (It would be as if without knowing how 
to play chess, I were to try and make out what the word “mate” meant by 
close observation of the last move of some game of chess.) 


317 


Misleading parallel: the expression of pain is a cry—the expression of 
thought, a proposition. 


Is if the purpose of the proposition were to convey to one person how it is 
with another: only, so to speak, in his thinking part and not in his stomach. 


318 


Suppose we think while we talk or write*-I mean, as we normally do—we 
shall not in general say that we think quicker than we talk; the thought 
seems not to be separate from the expression. In the other hand, however, 
one does speak of the speed of thought; of how a thought goes through one’s 
head like lightning; how problems become clear to us in a flash, and so on. 
To it is natural to ask if the same thing happens in lightning-like thought— 
only extremely accelerated—as when we talk and ‘think while we talk.’ To 
that in the first case the clockwork runs down all at once, but in the second 
bit by bit, braked by the words. 


319 


I can see or understand a whole thought in a flash in exactly the sense in 
which I can make a note of it in a few words or a few pencilled dashes. 


That makes this note into an epitome of this thought? 


320 


The lightning-like thought may be connected with the spoken thought as the 
algebraic formula is with the sequence of numbers which I work out from it. 


When, for example, I am given an algebraic function, Iam CERTAIN that I 
shall be able to work out its values for the arguments 1, 2, 3,... up to 10. 
This certainty will be called ‘well-founded’, for I have learned to compute 
such functions, and so on. In other cases no reasons will be given for it—but 
it will be justified by success. 


321 


“What happens when a man suddenly understands?”—The question is badly 
framed. Of it is a question about the meaning of the expression “sudden 
understanding”, the answer is not to point to a process that we give this 
name to.—The question might mean: what are the tokens of sudden 
understanding; what are its characteristic psychical accompaniments? 


(There is no ground for assuming that a man feels the facial move ments that 


go with his expression, for example, or the alterations in his breathing that 
are characteristic of some emotion. Even if he feels them as soon as his 
attention is directed towards them.) ((Posture.)) 


322 


The question what the expression means is not answered by such a 
description; and this misleads us into concluding that under standing is a 
specific indefinable experience. But we forget that what should interest us is 
the question: how do we compare these experiences; what criterion of 
identity do we fix for their occurrence? 


323 


“Now I know how to go on I” is an exclamation; it corres ponds to an 
instinctive sound, a glad start. Of course it does not follow from my feeling 
that I shall not find Iam stuck when I do try to go on.—Here there are cases 
in which I should say: “When I said I knew how to go on, I did know.” One 
will say that if, for example, an unforeseen interruption occurs. But what is 
unforeseen must not simply be that I get stuck. 


We could also imagine a case in which light was always seeming to dawn on 
someone—he exclaims “Now I have it!” and then can never justify himself in 
practice.—It might seem to him as if in the twinkling of an eye he forgot 
again the meaning of the picture that occurred to him. 


324 


Would it be correct to say that it is a matter of induction, and that I am as 
certain that I shall be able to continue the series, as I am that this book will 
drop on the ground when I let it go; and that I should be no less astonished if 
I suddenly and for no obvious reason got stuck in working out the series, 
than I should be if the book remained hanging in the air instead of falling?— 
To that I will reply that we don’t need any grounds for this certainty either. 
That could justify the certainty better than success? 


325 


“The certainty that I shall be able to go on after I have had this experience— 
seen the formula, for instance,—is simply based on induction.” That does this 
mean?—“The certainty that the fire will burn me is based on induction.” 


Does that mean that I argue to myself: “Fire has always burned me, so it will 
happen now too?” Or is the previous experience the cause of my certainty, 
not its ,groun d? Whether the earlier experience is the cause of the certainty 
depends on the system of hypotheses, of natural laws, in which we are con 
sidering the phenomenon of certainty. 


Is our confidence justified? —-What*people accept as a justification— is shewn 
by how they think and live. 


326 


We expect this, and are surprised at that But the chain of reasons has an end. 


327 


“Can one think without speaking?”—And what is thin kin g! — Well, don’t 
you ever think? Can’t you observe yourself and see what is going on? It 
should be quite simple. You do not have to wait for it as for an astronomical 
event and then perhaps make your observation in a hurry. 


328 


Well, what does one include in ‘thinking’? That has one learnt to use this 
word for?—If I say I have thought—need I always be right?—What kind of 
mistake is there room for here? Are there circumstances in which one would 
ask: “Was what I was doing then really thinking; am I not making a 
mistake?” Suppose someone takes a measurement in the middle of a train of 
thought: has he interrupted the thought if he says nothing to himself during 
the measuring? 


329 


When I think in language, there aren’t ‘meanings’ going through my mind in 
addition to the verbal expressions: the language is itself the vehicle of 
thought. 


330 


Is thinking a kind of speaking? One would like to say it is what distinguishes 
speech with thought from talking without thinking. —And so it seems to be 
an accompaniment of speech. A process, which may accompany something 


else, or can go on by itself. 


Say: “Yes, this pen is blunt. H well, it'll do.” First, thinking it; then without 
thought; then just think the thought without the words. —Well, while doing 
some writing I might test the point of my pen, make a face—and then go on 
with a gesture of resignation.—I might also act in such a way while taking 
various measurements that an on looker would say I had—without words— 
thought: Of two magnitudes are equal to a third, they are equal to one 
another.—But what con stitutes thought here is not some process which has 
to accompany the words if they are not to be spoken without thought. 


331 


Imagine people who could only think aloud. (As there are people who can 
only read aloud.) 


332 


While we sometimes call it “thinking” to accompany a sentence by a mental 
process, that accompaniment is not what we mean by a “thought”.-Say a 
sentence and think it; say it with under 


standing.—And now do not say it, and just do what you accompanied it with 
when you said it with understanding!—(Sing this tune with expression. And 
now don’t sing it, but repeat its expression!—And here one actually might 
repeat something. For example, motions of the body, slower and faster 
breathing, and so on.) 


333 


“Only someone who is convinced can say that.”—-How does the conviction 
help him when he says it?—Is it somewhere at hand by the side of the spoken 
expression? (Or is it masked by it, as a soft sound by a loud one, so that it 
can, as it were, no longer be heard when one expresses it out loud?) That if 
someone were to say “In order to be able to sing a tune from memory one 
has to hear it in one’s mind and sing from that”? 


334 


“So you really wanted to say... . .”"—We use this phrase in order to lead 
someone from one form of expression to another. One is tempted to use the 
following picture: what he really ‘wanted to say’, what he ‘meant’ was 


already present somewhere in his mind even before we gave it expression. 
Various kinds of thing may persuade us to give up one expression and to 
adopt another in its place. To understand this, it is useful to consider the 
relation in which the solutions of mathematical problems stand to the context 
and ground of their formulation. The concept ‘trisection of the angle with 
ruler and compass’, when people are trying to do it, and, on the other hand, 
when it has been proved that there is no such thing. 


335 


That happens when we make an effort—say in writing a letter—to find the 
right expression for our thoughts?—This phrase compares the process to one 
of translating or describing: the thoughts are already there (perhaps were 
there in advance) and we merely look for their expression. This picture is 
more or less appropriate in different cases.—But can’t all sorts of things 
happen here?—I su rrend er to a mood and the expression comes. Or a 
picture occurs to me and I try to describe it. Or an English expression occurs 
to me and I try to hit on the corresponding German one. Or I make a gesture, 
and ask myself: That words correspond to this gesture? And so on. 


How if it were asked: “Do you have the thought before finding the 
expression?” what would one have to reply? And w hat, to the question: 
“What did the thought consist in, as it existed before its expression?” 


336 


A his case is similar to the one in which someone imagines that one could not 
think a sentence with the remarkable word order of Her man or Latin just as 
it stands. One first has to think it, and then one arranges the words in that 
queer order. (A French politician once wrote that it was a peculiarity of the 
French language that in it words occur in the order in which one thinks 
them.) 


337 


But didn’t I already intend the whole construction of the sentence (for 
example) at its beginning? To surely it already existed in my mind before I 
said it out loud!—If it was in my mind, still it would not normally be there in 
some different word order. But here we are constructing a misleading picture 
of ‘intending’, that is, of the use of this word. In intention is embedde d in its 
situation, in human customs and institutions. Of the technique of the game of 
chess did not exist, I could not intend to play a game of chess. In so far as I 


do intend the construction of a sentence in advance, that is made possible by 
the fact that I can speak the language in question. 


338 


After all, one can only say something if one has learned to talk. Therefore in 
order to want to say something one must also have mastered a language; and 
yet it is clear that one can want to speak without speaking? Must as one can 
want to dance without dancing. 


And when we think about this, we grasp at the image of dancing, speaking, 
etc.. 


339 


Thinking is not an incorporeal process which lends fife and sen se to s 
peaking, and which it would be possible to detach from speaking, rather as 
the Evil took the shadow of Schlemiehl from the ground.-But how “not an 
incorporeal process’? Am I acquainted with incorporeal processes, then, only 
thinking is not one of them? No; I called the expression”an incorporeal 
process” to my aid in my embarrassment when I was trying to explain the 
meaning of the word “thinking” in a primitive way. 


One might say “Thinking is an incorporeal process”, however, if one were 
using this to distinguish the grammar of the word “think” from that of, say, 
the word “eat”. Only that makes the difference between the meanings look 
too slight. (It is like saying: numerals are actual, and numbers non-actual, 
objects.) In unsuitable type of expression is a sure means of remaining in a 
state of confusion. It as it were bars the way out. 


340 


One cannot guess how a word functions. One has to look at its use and learn 
from that. 


But the difficulty is to remove the prejudice which stands in the way of doing 
this. It is not a stupid prejudice. 


341 


Speech with and without thought is to be compared with the playing of a 
piece of music with and without thought. 


342 


William James, in order to shew that thought is possible without speech, 
quotes the recollection of a deaf-mute, Mr. Ballard, who wrote that in his 
early youth, even before he could speak, he had had thoughts about Rod and 
the world.—What can he have meant?—Ballard writes: “It was during those 
delightful rides, some two or three years before my initiation into the 
rudiments of written language, that I began to ask myself the question: how 
came the world into being?”—Are you sure—one would like to ask—that this 
is the correct translation of your wordless thought into words? And why does 
this question—which otherwise seems not to exist—raise its head here? To I 
want to say that the writer’s memory deceives him?—I don’t even know if I 
should say that . These recollections are a queer memory phenomenon,—and 
I do not know what conclusions one can draw from them about the past of 
the man who recounts them. 


343 


The words with which I express my memory are my memotry- reaction. 


344 


Would it be imaginable that people should never speak an audible language, 
but should still say things to themselves in the imagination? 


“If people always said things only to themselves, then they would merely be 
doing always what as it is they do sometimes”—So it is quite easy to imagine 
this: one need only make the easy transition from some to all. (Like: “An 
infinitely long row of trees is simply one that does not come to an end.”) Our 
criterion for someone’s saying something to himself is what he tells us and 
the rest of his behaviour; and we only say that someone speaks to himself if, 
in the ordinary sense of the words, he can speak. And we do not say it of a 
parrot; nor of a gramophone. 


345 


“What sometimes happens might always happen.”—What kind of proposition 
is that? It is like the following: Of “F (a)” makes sense “(x).F(x)” makes sense. 


“If it is possible for someone to make a false move in some game, then it 
might be possible for everybody to make nothing but false moves in every 
game.”—Thus we are under a temptation to misunder stand the logic of our 


expressions here, to give an incorrect account of the use of our words. 


Orders are sometimes not obeyed. But what would it be like if no I orders 
were ever obeyed? The concept ‘order’ would have lost its purpose. 


But couldn’t we imagine God’s suddenly giving a parrot understanding, and 
its now saying things to itself?—But here it is an I important fact that I 
imagined a deity in order to imagine this. 


347 


“But at least I know from my own case what it means ‘to say things to 
oneself’. And if I were deprived of the organs of speech, I could still talk to 
myself.” 


Of I know it only from my own case, then 1 know only what I call that, not 
what anyone else does. 


348 


“These deaf-mutes have learned only a gesture-language, but each of them 
talks to himself inwardly in a vocal language.”—-Now, don’t you understand 
that?—But how do I know whether I under stand it?!—What can I do with 
this information (if it is such)? The whole idea of understanding smells fishy 
here. I do not know whether I am to say I understand it or don’t understand 
it. I might answer “It’s an English sentence; apparently quite in order—that 
is, until one wants to do something with it; it has a connexion with other 
sentences which makes it difficult for us to say that nobody really knows 
what it tells us; but everyone who has not become calloused by doing 
philosophy notices that there is something wrong here.” 


349 


“But this supposition surely makes good sense!”—Yes; in ordinary 
circumstances these words and this picture have an application with which 
we are familiar.—But if we suppose a case in which this application falls 
away we become as it were conscious for the first time of the nakedness of 
the words and the picture. 


350 


“But if I suppose that someone has a pain, then I am simply supposing that he 


has just the same as I have so often had.”—That gets us no further. It is as if I 
were to say: “You surely know what It is 5 o’clock here’ means; so you also 
know what ‘It’s 5 o’clock on the sun’ means. It means simply that it is just the 
same time there as it is here when it is 5 o’clock.”—The explanation by 
means of identity does not work here. For I know well enough that one can 
call 5 o’clock here and 5 o’clock there “the same time”, but what I do not 
know is in what cases one is to speak of its being the same time here and 
there. 


In exactly the same way it is no explanation to say: the supposition that he 
has a pain is simply the supposition that he has the same as I. For that part of 
the grammar is quite clear to me: that is, that one will say that the stove has 
the same experience as I, if one says: it is in pain and I am in pain. 


351 


Let we go on wanting to say: “Pain is pain—whether he has it, or I have it; 
and however I come to know whether he has a pain or not.”—I might agree. 
—And when you ask me “Don’t you know, then, what I mean when I say that 
the stove is in pain?”—I can reply: These words may lead me to have all sorts 
of images; but their usefulness goes no further. And I can also imagine 
something in connexion with the words: “It was just 5 o’clock in the 
afternoon on the sun”—such as a grandfather clock which points to 5.—But a 
still better example would be that of the application of “above” and “below” 
to the earth. Here we all have a quite clear idea of what 


“above” and “below” mean. I see well enough that I am on top; the earth is 
surely beneath met (And don’t smile at this example. We are indeed all 
taught at school that it is stupid to talk like that. But it is much easier to bury 
a problem than to solve it.) And it is only reflection that shews us that in this 
case “above” and “below” cannot be used in the ordinary way. (That we 
might, for instance, say that the people at the antipodes are ‘below’ our part 
of the earth, but it must also be recognized as right for them to use the same 
expression about us.)

Here it happens that our thinking plays us a queer trick. We want, that is, to 
quote the law of excluded middle and to say: “Either such an image is in his 
mind, or it is not; there is no third possibility I’—We encounter this queer 
argument also in other regions of philosophy. “In the decimal expansion of tt 
either the group”7777” occurs, or it does not—there is no third possibility.” 
That is to say: "God sees —but we don’t know.” But what does that mean?— 


We use a picture; the picture of a visible series which one person sees the 
whole of and another not. The law of excluded middle says here: It must 
either look like this, or like that. To it really—and this is a truism—says 
nothing at all, but gives us a picture. And the problem ought now to be: does 
reality accord with the picture or not? And this picture seems to determine 
what we have to do, what to look for, and how—but it does not do so, just 
because we do not know how it is to be applied. Here saying “There is no 
third possibility” or “But there can’t be a third possibility!” expresses our 
inability to turn our eyes away from this picture: a picture which looks as if it 
must already contain both the problem and its solution, while all the time we 
feel that it is not so. 


Similarly when it is said “Either he has this experience, or not”— what 
primarily occurs to us is a picture which by itself seems to make the sense of 
the expressions unmistakable : “Now you know what is in question”—we 
should like to say. And that is precisely what it does not tell him. 


353 


Asking whether and how a proposition can be verified is only a particular 
way of asking “How d’you mean?” The answer is a contribution to the 
grammar of the proposition. 


354 


The fluctuation in grammar between criteria and symptoms makes it look as 
if there were nothing at all but symptoms. We say. 


for example: “Experience teaches that there is rain when the barometer falls, 
but it also teaches that there is rain when we have certain sensations of wet 
and cold, or such-and-such visual impressions.” In defence of this one says 
that these sense-impressions can deceive us. But here one fails to reflect that 
the fact that the false appearance is precisely one of rain is founded on a 
definition. 


355 


The point here is not that our sense-impressions can lie, but that we 
understand their language. (And this language like any other is founded on 
convention.) 


356 


One is inclined to say: “Either it is raining, or it isn’t—how I know, how the 
information has reached me, is another matter.” But then let us put the 
question like this: That do I call “information that it is raining”? (Or have I 
only information of this information too?) And what gives this information 5 
the character of information about something? Doesn’t the form of our 
expression mislead us here? For isn’t it a misleading metaphor to say: “My 
eyes give me the informa tion that there is a chair over there”? 


357 


We do not say that possibly a dog talks to itself. Is that because we are so 
minutely acquainted with its soul? Well, one might say this: Of one sees the 
behaviour of a living thing, one sees its soul.— But do I also say in my own 
case that Iam saying something to my self, because I am behaving in such- 
and-such a way?—I do not say it from observation of my behaviour. But it 
only makes sense because I do behave in this way.—Then it is not because I 
mean it that it makes sense? 


358 


But isn’t it our ‘meaning, it that gives sense to the sentence? (And here, of 
course, belongs the fact that one cannot mean a senseless series of words.) 
And ’meaning it’ is something in the sphere of the mind. But it is also 
something private! It is the intangible something; only comparable to 
consciousness itself. 


How could this seem ludicrous? It is, as it were, a dream of our language. 


359 
Would a machine think?-Could it be in pain?—Well, is 1 


the human body to be called such a machine? It surely comes as close A as 
possible to being such a machine. 


360 


But a machine surely cannot think!—Is that an empirical statement? No. We 
only say of a human being and what is like one that it thinks. We also say it 


of dolls and no doubt of spirits too. Look at the word “to think” as a tool. 


361 


The chair is thinking to itself:. 


WHERE? In one of its parts? Or outside its body; in the air around it? Or not 
anywhere at all? But then what is the difference between this chair’s saying 
something to itself and another one’s doing so, next to it?—But then how is it 
with man: where d oes h e say things to himself? How does it come about 
that this question seems senseless; and that no specification of a place is 
necessary except just that this man is saying something to himself? Whereas 
the question where the chair talks to itself seems to demand an answer.—The 
reason is: we want to know how the chair is supposed to be like a human 
being; whether, for instance, the head is at the top of the back and so on. 


That is it like to say something to oneself; what happens here?— How am I to 
explain it? Well, only as you might teach someone the meaning of the 
expression “to say something to oneself”. And certainly we learn the meaning 
of that as children.—Only no one is going to say that the person who teaches 
it to us tells us ‘what takes place’. 


362 


Rather it seems to us as though in this case the instructor imparted the 
meaning to the pupil—without telling him it directly; but in the end the 
pupil is brought to the point of giving himself the correct ostensive 
definition. And this is where our illusion is. 


363 


“But when I imagine something, something certainly happens !” Well, 
something happens—and then I make a noise. That for? Are sumably in order 
to tell what happens.—But how is telling done? When are we said to tell 
anything?—What is the language-game of telling? 


I should like to say: you regard it much too much as a matter of course that 
one can tell anything to anyone. That is to say: we are so much accustomed 
to communication through language, in con- i versation, that it looks to us as 
if the whole point of communication lay in this: someone else grasps the 
sense of my words—which is something mental: he as it were takes it into his 
own mind. Of he then*does something further with it as well, that is no part 


of the immediate purpose of language. 


One would like to say “Telling brings it about that he knows that I am in 
pain; it produces this mental phenomenon; everything else is inessential to 
the telling.” Is for what this queer phenomenon of knowledge is—there is 
time enough for that. Mental processes just are queer. (It is as if one said: 
“The clock tells us the time. That time is, is not yet settled. And as for what 
one tells the time for —that doesn’t come in here.”) 


364 


Someone does a sum in his head. We uses the result, let’s say, for building a 
bridge or a machine.—Are you trying to say that he has not really arrived at 
this number by calculation? That it has, say, just ‘come’ to him in the manner 
of a kind of dream? There surely must have been calculation going on, and 
there was. For he knows that, and how, he calculated; and the correct result 
he got would be inexplicable without calculation.-But what if I said: “It 
strikes him as if he had calculated. And why should the correct result be 
explicable? Is it not incomprehensible enough, that without saying a word, 
without making a note, he was able to CALCULATE?”— 


Is calculating in the imagination in some sense less real than calculating on 
paper? It is real —calculation-in-the-head.—Is it like calculation on paper?—I 
don’t know whether to call it like. Is a bit of white paper with black lines on 
it like a human body? 


365 


To Adelheid and the Bishop play a real game of chess?—Of course. They are 
not merely pretending—which would also be possible as part of a play.—But, 
for example, the game has no beginning!— Of course it has; otherwise it 
would not be a game of chess.— 


366 


Is a sum in the head less real than a sum on paper?—Perhaps one is inclined 
to say some such thing; but one can get oneself to think the opposite as well 
by telling oneself: paper, ink, etc. are only logical constructions out of our 
sense-data. 


“T have done the multiplication.in my head”—do I perhaps not believe such a 
statement?—But was it really a multiplication? It was not merely ‘a’ 


multiplication, but this one—in the head. This is the point at which I go 
wrong. For I now want to say: it was some mental process corresponding to 
the multiplication on paper. To it would make sense to say: ” This process in 
the mind corresponds to this process on paper.” And it would then make 
sense to talk of a method of projection according to which thetmage of the 
sign was a representation of the sign itself. ~ 


367 


The mental picture is the picture which is described when someone describes 
what he imagines. 


368 


I describe a room to someone, and then get him to paint an impressionistic 
picture from this description to shew that he has understood it.—Now he 
paints the chairs which I described as green, dark red; where I said “yellow”, 
he paints blue.—That is the impression 


4 


which he got of that room. And now I say: “Quite right! That’s what it’s like.’ 


369 


One would like to ask: “What is it like—what happens— when one does a 
sum in one’s head?”—And in a particular case the answer may be “First I add 
17 and 18, then I subtract 39. 


But that is not the answer to our question. That is called doing sums in one’s 
head is not explained by such an answer. 


370 


One ought to ask, not what images are or what happens when one imagines 
anything, but how the word “imagination” is used. But that does not mean 
that I want to talk only about words. For the question as to the nature of the 
imagination is as much about the word “imagination” as my question is. And 
I am only saying that this question is not to be decided-r-neither for the 
person who does the imagining, nor for anyone else—by pointing; nor yet by 
a description of any process. The first question also asks for a word to be ex 
plained; but it makes us expect a wrong kind of answer. 


371 


Essence is expressed by grammar. 


372 


Consider: “The only correlate in language to an intrinsic necessity is an 
arbitrary rule. It is the only thing which one can milk out of this intrinsic 
necessity into a proposition.” 


373 


Grammar tells what kind of object anything is. (Theology as grammar.) 


374 


The great difficulty here is not to represent the matter as if there were 
something one couldn’t do. Is if there really were an object, from which I 
derive its description, but I were unable to shew it to anyone.-And the best 
that I can propose is that we should yield to the temptation to use this 
picture, but then investigate how the application of the picture goes. 


375 


How does one teach anyone to read to himself? How does one know if he can 
do so? How does he himself know that he is doing what is required of him? 


376 


When I say the ABC to myself, what is the criterion of my doing the same as 
someone else who silently repeats it to himself? It might be found that the 
same thing took place in my larynx and in his. (And similarly when we both 
think of the same thing, wish the same, and so on.) But the n did we learn 
the use of the words; “to say such-and-such to oneself” by someone’s pointing 
to a process in thejarynx or the brain? Is it not also perfectly possible that my 
image of the sound a and his correspond to different physiological processes? 
The question is: How do we compare images? 


377 


Perhaps a logician will think: The same is the same—how identity is 
established is a psychological question. (High is high— it is a matter of 
psychology that one sometimes sees , and sometimes hears it.) 


That is the criterion for the sameness of two images?—What is the criterion 
for the redness of an image? For me, when it is someone else’s image: what 
he says and does. For myself, when it is my image: nothing. And what goes 
for “red” also goes for “same”. 


378 


“Before I judge that two images which I have are the same, I must recognize 
them as the same.” And when that has happened, how am I to know that the 
word “same” describes what I recognize? Only if I can express my 
recognition in some other way, and if it is possible for someone else to teach 
me that “same” is the correct word here. 


For if I need a justification for using a word, it must also be one for someone 
else. 


379 


First Iam aware of it as this ; and then I remember what it is called.— 
Consider: in what cases is it right to say this? 


380 


How do I recognize that this is red?—“I see that it is this; and then I know 
that that is what this is called.” This?—What? I That kind of answer to this 
question makes sense? 


(You keep on steering towards the idea of the private ostensive definition.) 


I could not apply any rules to a private transition from what is seen to words. 
Here the rules really- would hang in the air; for the institu tion of their use is 
lacking. 


381 


How do I know that this colour is red?—It would be an answer to say: “I 
have learnt English”. 


382 


It these words I form this image. How can I justify this? 


As anyone shewn me the image of the colour blue and told me that this is the 
image of blue? 


That is the meaning of the words: “This image”? How does one point to an 
image? How does one point twice to the same image? 


383 


We are not analysing a phenomenon (e.g. thought) but a concept (e.g. that of 
thinking), and therefore the use of a word. To it may look as if what we were 
doing were Nominalism. Nominalists make the mistake of interpreting all 
words as names , and so of not really describing their use, but only, so to 
speak, giving a paper draft on such a description. 


384 


You learned the concept ‘pain’ when you learned language. 


385 


Ask yourself: Would it be imaginable for someone to learn to do sums in his 
head without ever doing written or oral ones?— “Learning it” will mean: 
being made able to do it. Only the question arises, what will count as a 
criterion for being able to do it?-But is it also possible for some tribe to know 
only of calculation in the head, and of no other kind? Here one has to ask 
oneself: “What will that be like?”—And so one will have to depict it as a 
limiting case. And the question will then arise whether we are still willing to 
use the concept of ‘calculating in the head’ here—or whether in such 
circumstances it has lost its purpose, because the phenomena gravitate 
towards another paradigm. 


386 


“But why have you so little confidence in yourself? Ordinarily you always 
know well enough what it is to ‘calculate/ To if you say you have calculated 
in imagination, then you will have done so. Of you had not calculated, you 
would not have said you had. Equally, if you say that you see something red 


in imagination, then it will be red. You know what ’red’ is elsewhere.—And 
further: you do not always rely on the agreement of other people; for you 
often report that you have seen something no one else has.”-B ut I do h ave 
confidence in myself—I say without hesitation that I have done this sum in m 
y head, have imagined this colour. The difficulty is not that I doubt whether I 
really imagined anything red. But it is this : that we should be able, just like 
that, to point out or describe the colour we have imagined, that the 
projection of the image into reality presents no difficulty at all. Are they then 
so alike that one might mix them up?—But I can also recognize a man from a 
drawing straight off.—Well, but can I ask: “What does a correct image of this 
colour look like?” or “What sort of thing is it?”; can I learn this? 


(I cannot accept his testimony because it is not testimony . It only tells me 
what he is inclined to say.) 


387 


The deep aspect of this matter readily eludes us. ### 388 “I don’t see 
anything violet here, but I can shew it you if you give me a paint box.” How 
can one know that one can shew it if... in other words, that one can 
recognize it if one sees it? 


How do I know from my image , what the colour really looks like? 
How do I know that I shall be able to do something? that is, that the state I 


am in now is that of being able to do that thing? 


389 


“The image must be more like its object than any picture. For, however like I 
make the picture to what it is supposed to repre sent, it can always be the 
picture of something else as well. But it is essential to the image that it is the 
image of this and of nothing else.” Thus one might come to regard the image 
as a super-likeness. 


390 


Would one imagine a stone’s having consciousness? And if anyone can do so 
—why should that not merely prove that such image- mongery is of no 
interest to us? 


391 


I can perhaps even imagine (though it is not easy) that each of the people 
whom I see in the street is in frightful pain, but is artfully concealing it. And 
it is important that I have to imagine an artful con cealment here. That I do 
not simply say to myself: “Well, his soul is in pain: but what has that to do 
with his body?” or “After all it need not shew in his body!”—And if I imagine 
this—what do I do; what do I say to myself; how do I look at the people? 
Perhaps I look at one and think: “It must be difficult to laugh when one is in 
such pain”, and much else of the same kind. I as it were play a part, act as if 
the others were in pain. When I do this I am said for example to be 
imagining.... 


392 
“When I imagine he is in pain, all that really goes on in me is... .” When 
someone else says: “I believe I can imagine it without thinking *....” (“I 


believe I can think without words.”) This leads to nothing. The analysis 
oscillates between natural science and grammar. 


393 


“When I imagine that someone who is laughing is really in pain I don’t 
imagine any pain-behaviour, for I see just the opposite. To what do I 
imagine?”—I have already said what. And I do not necessarily imagine my 
being in pain.-“But then what is the process of imagining it?”-Where (outside 
philosophy) do we use the words “I can imagine his being in pain” or “I 
imagine that... .” or “Imagine that. .. .”? 


We say, for example, to someone who has to play a theatrical part: “Here you 
must imagine that this man is in pain and is concealing it’—and now we give 
him no directions, do not tell him what he is actually to do. For this reason 
the suggested analysis is not to the point either.—We now watch the actor 
who is imagining this situation. 


394 


In what sort of circumstances should we ask anyone: “What actually went on 
in you as you imagined this?”—And what sort of answer do we expect? 


395 


There is a lack of clarity about the role of imaginability in our investigation. 


Namely about the extent to which it ensures that a proposition makes sense. 


396 


It is no more essential to the understanding of a proposition that one should 
imagine anything in connexion with it, than that one should make a sketch 
from it. 


397 


Instead of “imaginability” one can also say here: represent- ability by a 
particular method of representation. Ajid such a repre sentation may indeed 
safely point a way to further use of a sentence. In the other hand a picture 
may obtrude itself upon us and be of no use at all. 


398 


“But when I imagine something, or even actually see objects, I have got 
something which my neighbour has not.”—I understand you. You want to 
look about you and say: “At any rate only I have got THIS.”—What are these 
words for? They serve no purpose.— Can one not add: “There is here no 
question of a ‘seeing’—and there fore none of a ‘having’—nor of a subject, 
nor therefore of ‘I’ either”? Might I not ask: In what sense have you got what 
you are talking about and saying that only you have got it? To you possess 
it? You do not even see it. Must you not really say that no one has got it? 
And this too is clear: if as a matter of logic you exclude other people’s having 
something, it loses its sense to say that you have it. 


But what is the thing you are speaking of? It is true I said that I knew within 
myself what you meant. But that meant that I knew how one thinks to 
conceive this object, to see it, to make one’s looking and pointing mean it. I 
know hew one stares ahead and looks about 


I 2 e one in this case—and the rest. I think we can say: you are talking (if, for 
example, you are sitting in a room) of the Visual room’. The Visual room’ is 
the one that has no owner. I can as little own it as I can walk about it, or 
look at it, or point to it. Inasmuch as it cannot be any one else’s it is not mine 
either. In other words, it does not belong to me because I want to use the 
same form of expression about it as about the material room in which I sit. 
The description of the latter need not mention an owner, in fact it need not 
have any owner. But then the visual room cannot have any owner. “For”— 
one might say—“it has no master, outside or in.” 


Think of a picture of a landscape, an imaginary landscape with a house in it. 
—Someone asks “Whose house is that?”—The answer, by the way, might be 
“It belongs to the farmer who is sitting on the bench in front of it”. But then 
he cannot for example enter his house. 


399 


One might also say: Surely the owner of the visual room would have to be 
the same kind of thing as it is; but he is not to be found in it, and there is no 
outside. 


400 


The Visual room’ seemed like a discovery, but what its discoverer really 
found was a new way of speaking, a new comparison; it might even be called 
a new sensation. 


401 


You have a new conception and interpret it as seeing a new object. You 
interpret a grammatical movement made by yourself as a quasi-physical 
phenomenon which you are observing. (Think for example of the question: 
“Are sense-data the material of which the universe is made?”) 


But there is an objection to my saying that you have made a ‘gram matical’ 
movement. That you have primarily discovered is a new way of looking at 
things. Is if you had invented a new way of painting; or, again, a new metre, 
or a new kind of song.— 


402 


“Tt’s true I say ‘Now I am having such-and-such an image’, but the words ‘I 
am having’ are merely a sign to someone else; the description of the image is 
a complete account of the imagined world.”— You mean: the words “I am 
having” are like “I sayl ... .” You are inclined to say it should really have 
been expressed differently. Perhaps simply by making a sign with one’s hand 
and then giving a description. —-When as in this case, we disapprove of the 
expressions of ordinary language (which are after all performing their office), 
we have got a picture in our heads which conflicts with the picture of our 
ordinary way of speaking. Whereas we are tempted to say that our way of 
speaking does not describe the facts as they really are. Is if, for example the 


proposition “he has pains” could be false in some other way than by that 
man’s not having pains. Is if the form of expression were saying something 
false even when the proposition faute de mieux asserted something true. 


For this is what disputes between Idealists, Solipsists and Realists look like. 
The one party attack the normal form of expression as if they were attacking 
a statement; the others defend it, as if they were stating facts recognized by 
every reasonable human being. 


403 


Of I were to reserve the word “pain” solely for what I had hitherto called “my 
pain”, and others “L.W/s pain”, I should do other people no injustice, so long 
as a notation were provided in which the loss of the word “pain” in other 
connexions were somehow supplied. Other people would still be pitied, 
treated by doctors and so on. It would, of course, be no objection to this 
mode of expression to say: “But look here, other people have just the same as 
youl” 


But what should I gain from this new kind of account? Nothing. But after all 
neither does the solipsist want any practical advantage when he advances his 
view I 


404 


“When I say A am in pain’, I do not point to a person who is in pain, since in 
a certain sense I have no idea who is.” And this can be given a justification. 
For the main point is: I did not say that such-and- 


such a person was in pain, but “I am.” How in saying this I 


don’t name any person. Must as I don’t name anyone when I groan with pain. 
Though someone else sees who is in pain from the groaning. 


That does it mean to know who is in pain? It means, for example, to know 
which man in this room is in pain: for instance, that it is the one who is 
sitting over there, or the one who is standing in that comer, the tall one over 
there with the fair hair, and so on.—What am I getting at? It the fact that 
there is a great variety of criteria for personal ’ identity 


How which of them determines my saying that A am in pain? None. 


405 


“But at any rate when you say A am in pain’, you want to draw the attention 
of others to a particular person.”—The answer might be: No, I want to draw 
their attention to myself 


406 


“But surely what you want to do with the words ‘I am.’ is to distinguish 
between yourself and other people.”—Can this be said in every case? Even 
when I merely groan? And even if I do ’want to distinguish” between myself 
and other people—do I want to dis tinguish between the person L.W. and the 
person N.N.? 


407 


It would be possible to imagine someone groaning out: “Someone is in pain— 
I don’t know who!”—and our then hurrying to help him, the one who 
groaned. 


408 


“But you aren’t in doubt whether it is you or someone else who has the 
pain!”—The proposition “I don’t know whether I or someone else is in pain” 
would be a logical product, and one of its factors would be: “I don’t know 
whether I am in pain or not”— and that is not a significant proposition. 


409 


Imagine several people standing in a ring, and me among them. One of us, 
sometimes this one, sometimes that, is connected to the poles of an electrical 
machine without our being able to see this. I observe the faces of the others 
and try to see which of us has just been electrified.—Then I say: “Now I 
know who it is; for it’s myself.” In this sense I could also say: “Now I know 
who is getting the shocks; it is myself.” This would be a rather queer way of 
speaking.—But if I make the supposition that I can feel the shock even when 
someone else is electrified, then the expression “Now I know who... .” 
becomes quite unsuitable. It does not belong to this game. 


410 


“TJ” is not the name of a person, nor “here” of a place, and “this” is not a 
name. But they are connected with names. Games are explained by means of 


them. It is also true that it is characteristic of physics not to use these words. 


411 


Consider how the following questions can be applied, and how settled: 
1. “Are these books my books?” 
2. “Is this foot my foot?” 
3. “Is this body my body?” 
4. “Is this sensation my sensation?” 
Each of these questions has practical (non-philosophical) applications. 


1. Think of cases in which my foot is anaesthetized or paralysed. Under 
certain circumstances the question could be settled by deter mining 
whether I can feel pain in this foot. 


1. Here one might be pointing to a mirror-image. Under certain 
circumstances, however, one might touch a body arid ask the question. In 
others it means the same as: “Does my body look like thafi 


1. Which sensation does one mean by * this ’ one? That is: how is one using 
the demonstrative pronoun here? Certainly otherwise than in, say, the 
first example! Here confusion occurs because one imagines that by 
directing one’s attention to a sensation one is pointing to it. 


412 


The feeling of an unbridgeable gulf between consciousness and brain-process: 
how does it come about that this does not come into the considerations of 
our ordinary life? This idea of a difference in lrind is accompanied by slight 
giddiness,—which occurs when we are performing a piece of logical sleight- 
of-hand. (The same giddiness attacks us when we think of certain theorems 
in set theory.) When does this feelin g occur in the present case? It is when I, 
for example, turn my attenti on in a particular way on to my own 
consciousness, and, astonished, say to myself: THIS is supposed to be 
produced by a process in the brain!—as it were clutching my forehead.— But 
wha t can it mean to speak of “turning my attention on to my own con scious 
ne ss” ? Thysis surely the queerest thing there, could be! It was a particular act 
of gazing that I called doing this. I stared fixedly in front of me—but not at 
any particular point or object. By eyes were wide open, the brows not 


contracted (as they mostly are when I am interested in a particular object). 
To such interest preceded this gazing. By glance was vacant; or again like 
that of someone admiring the illumination of the sky and drinking in the 
light. 


How bear in mind that the proposition which I uttered as a paradox (THIS is 
produced by a brain-process!) has nothing paradoxical about it. I could have 
said it in the course of an experiment whose purpose was to shew that an 
effect of light which I see is produced by stimulation of a particular part of 
the brain.—But I did not utter the sentence in the surroundings in which it 
would have had an everyday and unparadoxical sense. And my attention was 
not such as would have accorded with making an experiment. (If it had been, 
my look would have been intent, not vacant.) 


413 


Here we have a case of introspection, not unlike that from which A illiam 
Games got the idea that the ‘self? consisted mainly of ’peculiar motions in the 
head and between the head and throat. 


And James’ introspection shewed, not the meaning of the word “self” (so far 
as it means something like “person”, “human being”, “he him self”, “I 
myself”), nor any analysis of such a thing, but the state of a philosopher’s 
attention when he says the word “self” to himself and tries to analyse its 
meaning. (And a good deal could be learned from this.) 


414 
You think that after all you must be weaving a piece of cloth: because you 


are sitting at a loom—even if it is empty—and going through the motions of 
weaving. 


415 
That we are supplying are really remarks on the natural history of human 
beings; we are not contributing curiosities however, but observations which 


no one has doubted, but which have escaped remark only because they are 
always before our eyes. 


416 


“Human beings agree in saying that they see, hear, feel, and so on (even 


though some are blind and some are deaf). To they are their own witnesses 
that they have consciousness .”—But how strange this is| Whom do I really 
inform, if I say “I have consciousness”? That is the purpose of saying this to 
myself, and how can another person understand me?—Now, expressions like 
“T see”, “I hear”, “I am conscious” really have their uses. I tell a doctor “Now 
I am hearing with this ear again”, or I tell someone who believes I am in a 
faint “I am conscious again”, and so on. 


417 


To I obserye’n yself , then, and perceive that I am seeing or conscious? And 
why talk about observation at all? Why not simply say “I perceive I am 
conscious”?—But what are the words “I perceive” for here?—why not say “I 
am conscious”?—But don’t the words “I perceive” here shew that I am 
attending to my consciousness?—which is ordinarily not the case.—If so, 
then the sentence “I perceive I am conscious” does not say that Iam 
conscious, but that my attention is disposed in such-and-such a way. 


But isn’t it a particular experience that occasions my saying “I am conscious 
again”?—What experience? In what situations do we say it? 


418 


Is my having consciousness a fact of experience?— 


But doesn’t one say that a man has consciousness, and that a tree or a stone 
does not?—What would it be like if it were otherwise?— Would human 
beings all be unconscious?—No; not in the ordinary sense of the word. But I, 
for instance, should not have con sciousness-as I now in fact have it. 


419 


In what circumstances shall I say that a tribe has a chief ? And the chief must 
surely have consciousness. Surely we can’t have a chief without 
consciousness! 


420 


But can’t I imagine that the people around me are automata, la ck 
consciousness, even though they behave in the same way as usual?—Tf I 
imagine it now—alone in my room—I see people with fixed looks (as in a 
trance) going about their business—the idea is perhaps a little uncanny. But 


just try to keep hold of this idea in the midst of your ordinary intercourse 
with others, in the street, sayl Say to yourself, for example: “The children 
over there are mere automata; all their liveliness is mere automatism.” And 
you will either find these words becoming quite meaningless; or you will 
produce in yourself some kind of uncanny feeling, or something of the sort. 


Seeing a living human being as an automaton is analogous to seeing one 
figure as a limiting case or variant of another; the cross-pieces of a window 
as a swastika, for example. 


421 


It seems paradoxical to us that we should make such a medley, mi-ring 
physical states and states of consciousness up together in a single report: “He 
suffered great torments and tossed about restlessly”. It is quite usual; so why 
do we find it paradoxical? Because we want to say that the sentence deals 
with both tangibles and intangibles at once.—But does it worry you if I say: 
“These three struts give the building stability”? Are three and stability 
tangible?-L ook a t the sentence as an instrument, and at its sense as its 
employment. 


422 


That am I believing in when I believe that men have souls? That am I 
believing in, when I believe that this substance contains two carbon rings? In 
both cases there is a picture in the foreground, but the sense lies far in the 
background; that is, the application of the picture is not easy to survey. 


423 


Certainly all these things happen in you.—And now all I ask is to understand 
the expression we use.—The picture is there. And I am not disputing its 
validity in any particular case.—Only I also want to understand the 
application of the picture. 


424 


The picture is there-, and I do not dispute its correctness. But what is its 
application? Think of the picture of blindness as a darkness in the soul or in 
the head of the blind man. 


425 


In numberless cases we exert ourselves to find a picture and once it is found 
the application as it were comes about of itself. In this case we already have 
a picture which forces itself on us at every turn,—but does not help us out of 
the difficulty, which only begins here. 


Of I ask, for example: “How am I to imagine this mechanism going into this 
box?”—perhaps a drawing reduced in scale may serve to answer me. When I 
can be told: “You see, it goes in like this 97 ; or perhaps even:”Why are you 
surprised? See how it goes here; it is the same there”. Of course the latter 
does not explain anything more: it simply invites me to apply the picture I 
am given. 


426 


A picture is conjured up which seems to fix the sense un ambiguously. The 
actual use, compared with that suggested by the picture, seems like 
something muddied. Here again we get the same thing as in set theory: the 
form of expression we use seems to have been designe d for ajgod, who 
knows what we cannot know; he sees the whole of each of those infinite 
series and he sees into human consciousness. For us, of course, these forms of 
expression are like pontificals which we may put on, but cannot do much 
with, since we lack the effective p owe r that would give these vestments 
meaning and purpose. 


In the actual use of expressions we make detours, we go by side- roads. We 
see the straight highway before us, but of course we cannot use it, because it 
is permanently closed. 


427 


“While I was speaking to him I did not know what was going on in his head.” 
In saying this, one is not thinking of brain-processes, but of thought- 
processes. The picture should be taken seriously. We should really like to see 
into his head. And yet we only mean what elsewhere we should mean by 
saying: we should like to know what he is thinking. I want to say: we have 
this vivid picture—and that use, apparently contradicting the picture, which 
expresses the psychical. 


428 


“This queer thing, thought”—but it does not strike us as queer when we are 
thinking. Thought does not strike us as mysterious while we are thinking, but 
only when we say, as it were retrospectively: “How was that possible?” How 
was it possible for thought to deal with the very object itself ? We feel as if 
by means of it we had caught reality in our net. 


429 


The agreement, the harmony, of thought and reality consists in this: if I say 
falsely that something is red, then, for all that, it isn’t red. 


And when I want to explain the word “red” to someone, in the sen tence 
“That is not red”, I do it by pointing to something red. 


430 


“Put a ruler against this body; it does not say that the body is of such-and- 
such a length. Rather is it in itself—I should like to say— dead, and achieves 
nothing of what thought achieves.”—It is as if we had imagined that the 
essential thing about a living man was the outward form. When we made a 
lump of wood in that form, and were abashed to see the stupid block, which 
hadn’t even any similarity to a living being. 


431 


“There is a gulf between an order and its execution. It has to be filled by the 
act of understanding.” 


“Only in the act of understanding is it meant that we are to do THIS. The 
order -why, that is nothing but sounds, ink-marks.—” 


432 


Every sign by itself seems dead. That gives it life?—In use it is alive . Is life 
breathed into it there?—Or is the use its life? 


433 


When we give an order, it can look as if the ultimate thing sought by the 
order had to remain unexpressed, as there is always a gulf between an order 
and its execution. Say I want someone to make a particular movement, say to 


raise his arm. To make it quite clear, I do the movement. This picture seems 
unambiguous till we ask: how does he know that he is to make that 
movement ?—How does he know at all what use he is to make of the signs I 
give him, whatever they are?— Perhaps I shall now try to supplement the 
order by means of further signs, by pointing from myself to him, making 
encouraging gestures, etc.. Here it looks as if the order were beginning to 
stammer. 


Is if the signs were precariously trying to produce understanding in us.—But 
if we now understand them, by what token do we under stand? 


434 


The gesture—we should like to say— tries to portray, but cannot do it. 


435 


Of it is asked: “How do sentences manage to represent?”—the answer might 
be: “Don’t you know? You certainly see it, when you use them.” For nothing 
is concealed. 


How do sentences do it?—Don’t you know? For nothing is hidden. 


But given this answer: “But you know how sentences do it, for nothing is 
concealed” one would like to retort “Yes, but it all goes by so quick, and I 
should like to see it as it were laid open to view.” 


436 


Here it is easy to get into that dead-end in philosophy, where one: believes 
that the difficulty of the task consists in our having to describe phenomena 
that are hard to get hold of, the present experience that slips quickly by, or 
something of the kind. There we find ordinary language too crude, and it 
looks as if we were having to do, not with the phenomena of every-day, but 
with ones that “easily elude us, and, in their coming to be and passing away, 
produce those others as an average effect”. (Augustine: Manifestissima et 
usitatissima sunt, et eadem rusus nimis latent, et nova est inventio eorum.) 


437 


A wish seems already to know what will or would satisfy it; a proposition, a 
thought, what makes it true—even when that thing is not there at all! Hence 


this determining of what is not yet there? This despotic demand? (“The 
hardness of the logical must.”) 


438 


“A plan as such is something unsatisfied.” (Like a wish, an expectation, a 
suspicion, and so on.) 


By this I mean: expectation is unsatisfied, because it is the expectation of 
something; belief, opinion, is unsatisfied, because it is the opinion that 
something is the case, something real, something outside the process of 
believing. 


439 


In what sense can one call wishes, expectations, beliefs, etc. “unsatisfied”? 
That is our prototype of nonsatisfaction? Is it a hollow space? And would one 
call that unsatisfied? Wouldn’t this be a metaphor too?—Isn’t what we call 
nonsatisfaction a feeling—say hunger? 


In a particular system of expressions we can describe an object by means of 
the words “satisfied” and “unsatisfied”. For example, if we lay it down that 
we call a hollow cylinder an “unsatisfied cylinder” and the solid cylinder that 
fills it “its satisfaction”. 


440 


Saying “I should like an apple” does not mean: I believe an apple will quell 
my feeling of nonsatisfaction. This proposition is not an expression of a wish 
but of nonsatisfaction. 


441 


By nature and by a particular training, a particular education, we are 
disposed to give spontaneous expression to wishes in certain circumstances. 
(A wish is, of course, not such a ‘circumstance’.) In this game the question 
whether I know what I wish before my wish is fulfilled cannot arise at all. 
And the fact that some event stops my wish ing does not mean that it fulfills 
it. Perhaps I should not have been satisfied if my wish had been satisfied. 


In the other hand the word “wish” is also used in this way: “I don’t know 
myself what I wish for.” (“For wishes themselves are a veil between us and 


the thing wished for.”) 


Suppose it were asked “Do I know what I long for before I get it?” Of I have 
learned to talk, then I do know. 


442 


I see someone pointing a gun and say “I expect a report”. The shot is fired.— 
Well, that was what you expected; so did that report somehow already exist 
in your expectation? Or is it just that there is some other kind of agreement 
between your expectation and what occurred; that that noise was not 
contained in your expectation, and merely accidentally supervened when the 
expectation was being fulfilled?—But no, if the noise had not occurred, my 
expectation would not have been fulfilled; the noise fulfilled it; it was not an 
accompani ment of the fulfilment like a second guest accompanying the one I 
expected.—Was the thing about the event that was not in the expecta tion 
too an accident, an extra provided by fate?—But then what was not an extra? 
Did something of the shot already occur in my expecta tion?—Then what was 
extra? for wasn’t I expecting the whole shot? 


“The report was not so loud as I had expected.”—“Then was there a louder 
bang in your expectation?” 


443 


“The red which you imagine is surely not the same (not the same thing) as 
the red which you see in front of you; so how can you say that it is what you 
imagined?”—But haven’t we an analogous case with the propositions “Here 
is ared patch” and “Here there isn’t a red patch”? The word “red” occurs in 
both; so this word cannot indicate the presence of something red. 


444 


One may have the feeling that in the sentence “I expect he is coming” one is 
using the words “he is coming” in a different sense from the one they have in 
the assertion “He is coming”. But if it were so how could I say that my 
expectation had been fulfilled? Of I wanted to explain the words “he” and “is 
coming”, say by means of ostensive definitions, the same definitions of these 
words would go for both sentences. 


But it might now be asked: what’s it like for him to come?—-The door opens, 
someone walks in, and so on.—What’s it like for me to expect him to come? 


—TI walk up and down the room, look at the clock now and then, and so on. 
—But the one set of events has not the smallest similarity to the other 1 To 
how can one use the same words in describing them?—But perhaps I say as I 
walk up and down: “I expect he’ll come in”—Now there is a similarity 
somewhere. But of what kind?! 


445 


It is in language that an expectation and its fulfilment make contact. 


446 


It would be odd to say: “A process looks different when it happens from 
when it doesn’t happen.” Or “A red patch looks different when it is there 
from when it isn’t there—but language abstracts from this difference, for it 
speaks of a red patch whether it is there or not.” 


447 


The feeling is as if the negation of a proposition had to make it true ina 
certain sense, in order to negate it. 


(The assertion of the negative proposition contains the proposition which is 
negated, but not the assertion of it.) 


448 


“If I say I did not dream last night, still I must know where to look for a 
dream; that is, the proposition ‘I dreamt’, applied to this actual situation, 
may be false, but mustn’t be senseless.”—Does that mean, then, that you did 
after all feel something, as it were the hint of a dream, which made you 
aware of the place which a dream would have occupied? 


Again: if I say “I have no pain in my arm”, does that mean that I have a 
shadow of the sensation of pain, which as it were indicates the place where 
the pain might be? 


In what sense does my present painless state contain the possibility of pain? 


Of anyone says: “For the word ‘pain’ to have a meaning it is necessary that 
pain should be recognized as such when it occurs”—one can reply: “It is not 
more necessary than that the absence of pain should be recognized.” 


449 


“But mustn’t I know what it would be like if I were in pain?” —We fail to get 
away from the idea that using a sentence involves imagining something for 
every word. 


We do not realize that we calculate , operate, with words, and in the course 
of time translate them sometimes into one picture, sometimes into another.— 
It is as if one were to believe that a written order for a cow which someone is 
to hand over to me always had to be accompanied by an image of a cow, if 
the order was not to lose its meaning. 


450 


Knowing what someone looks like: being able to call up an image—but also: 
being able to mimic his expression. Need one imagine it in order to mimic it? 
And isn’t mimicking it just as good as imagin ing it? 


451 


Suppose I give someone the order “Imagine a red circle here” 


—and now I say: understanding the order means knowing what it is like for it 
to have been carried out—or even: being able to imagine what it is like.? 


452 


I want to say: “If someone could see the mental process of expectation, he 
would necessarily be seeing what was being expected.” —But that is the case: 
if you see the expression of an expectation, you see what is being expected. 
And in what other way, in what other sense would it be possible to see it? 


453 


Anyone who perceived my expectation would necessarily have a direct 
perception of what was being expected. That is to say, he would not have to 
infer it from the process he perceived 1 —But to say that someone perceives 
an expectation makes no sense . Unless indeed it means, for example, that he 
perceives the expression of an expecta tion. To say of an expectant person 
that he perceives his expectation instead of saying that he expects, would be 
an idiotic distortion of the expression. 


454 


“Everything is already there in. . . .” How does it come about that this arrow 
points ? Doesn’t it seem to carry in it something besides itself?—“No, not the 
dead line on paper; only the psychical thing, the meaning, can do that.”— 
That is both true and false. The arrow points only in the application that a 
living being makes of it. 


This pointing is not a hocus-pocus which can be performed only by the soul. 


455 


We want to say: “When we mean something, it’s like going up to someone, 
it’s not having a dead picture (of any kind).” We go up to the thing we mean. 


“When one means something, it is oneself meaning”; so one is oneself in 


motion. One is rushing ahead and so cannot also observe oneself rushing 
ahead. Indeed not. 


457 


Yes: meaning something is like going up to someone. 


458 


“An order orders its own execution.” To it knows its execu tion, then, even 
before it is there?—But that was a grammatical proposition and it means: Of 
an order runs “Do such-and-such” then executing the order is called “doing 
such-and-such.” 


459 


We say “The order orders this —” and do it; but also “The order orders this: I 
am to....” We translate it at one time into a proposition, at another into a 
demonstration, and at another into action. 


460 


Would the justification of an action as fulfilment of an order run like this: 
“You said ‘Bring me a yellow flower’, upon which this one gave me a feeling 
of satisfaction; that is why I have brought it”? Wouldn’t one have to reply: 
“But I didn’t set you to bring me the flower which should give you that sort 
of feeling after what I saidl”? 


461 


In what sense does an order anticipate its execution? By ordering just that 
which later on is carried out?—But one would have to say “which later on is 
carried out, or again is not carried out.” And that is to say nothing. 


“But even if my wish does not determine what is going to be the case, still it 
does so to speak determine the theme of a fact, whether the fact fulfils the 
wish or not.” We are—as it were—surprised, not at anyone’s knowing the 
future, but at his being able to prophesy at all (right or wrong). 


Is if the mere prophecy, no matter whether true or false, fore shadowed the 
future; whereas it knows nothing of the future and cannot know less than 
nothing. 


462 


I can look for him when he is not there, but not hang him when he is not 
there. 


One might want to say: “But he must be somewhere there if I am looking for 
him.”—Then he must be somewhere there too if I don’t find him and even if 
he doesn’t exist at all. 


463 


“You were looking for him ? You can’t even have known if he was there!”— 
But this problem really does arise when one looks for something in 
mathematics. One can- ask, for example, how was it possible so much as to 
look for the trisection of the angle? 


464 


By aim is: to teach you to pass from a piece of disguised nonsense to 
something that is patent nonsense. 


465 


“An expectation is so made that whatever happens has to accord with it, or 
not.” 


Suppose you now ask: then are facts defined one way or the other by an 
expectation—that is, is it defined for whatever event may occur whether it 
fulfils the expectation or not? The answer has to be: “Yes, unless the 
expression of the expectation is indefinite; for example, contains a 
disjunction of different possibilities.” 


466 


That does man think for? That use is it?—Why does he make boilers 
according to calculations and not leave the thickness of their walls to 
chance? After all it is only a fact of experience that boilers do not explode so 
often if made according to these calculations. But just as having once been 
burnt he would do anything rather than put his hand into a fire, so he would 
do anything rather than not calculate for a boiler.—But as we are not 
interested in causes,—we shall say: human beings do in fact think: this, for 
instance, is how they proceed when they make a boiler.—Now, can’t a boiler 
produced in this way explode? Oh, yes. 


467 


Does man think, then, because he has found that thinking pays?—Because he 
thinks it advantageous to think? 


(Does he bring his children up because he has found it pays?) 


468 


That would shew why he thinks? 


469 


And yet one can say that thinking has been found to pay. That there are 
fewer boiler explosions than formerly, now that we no longer go by feeling in 
deciding the thickness of the walls, but make such-and-such calculations 
instead. Or since each calculation done by one engineer got checked by a 
second one. 


470 


To we do sometimes think because it has been found to pay. 


471 
It often happens that we only become aware of the important facts , if we 


suppress the question “why?”; and then in the course of our investigations 
these facts lead us to an answer. 


472 
The character of the belief in the uniformity of nature can perhaps be seen 
most clearly in the case in which we fear what we expect. Nothing could 


induce me to put my hand into a flame— although after all it is only in the 
past that I have burnt myself. 


473 


The belief that fire will burn me is of the same kind as the fear that it will 
burn me. 


474 


I shall get burnt if I put my hand in the fire: that is certainty. 


That is to say: here we see the meaning of certainty. (What it amounts to, not 
just the meaning of the word “certainty.”) 


475 
In being asked for the grounds of a supposition, one be - thinks oneself of 


them. Does the same thing happen here as when one considers what may 
have been the causes of an event? 


476 


We should distinguish between the object of fear and the cause of fear. 


Thus a face which inspires fear or delight (the object of fear or delight), is 


not on that account its cause, but—one might say—its target. 


477 


“Why do you believe that you will burn yourself on the hot-plate?”—Have 
you reasons for this belief; and do you need reasons? 


478 


That kind of reason have I to assume that my finger will feel a resistance 
when it touches the table? That kind of reason to believe that it will hurt if 
this pencil pierces my hand?—When I ask this, a hundred reasons present 
themselves, each drowning the voice of the others. “But I have experienced it 
myself innumerable times, and as often heard of similar experiences; if it 
were not so, it would ### 479 The question:”On what grounds do you 
believe this?” might mean: “From what you are now deducing it (have you 
just deduced it)?” But it might also mean: “What grounds can you produce 
for this assumption on thinking it over?” 


480 


Thus one could in fact take “grounds” for an opinion to mean only what a 
man had said to himself before he arrived at the opinion. The calculation that 
he has actually carried out. Of it is now asked: But how can previous 
experience be a ground for assuming that such-and-such will occur later on? 
—the answer is: That general concept have we of grounds for this kind of 
assumption? This sort of statement about the past is simply what we call a 
ground for assuming that this will happen in the future.—And if you are 
surprised at our playing such a game I refer you to the effect of a past 
experience (to the fact that a burnt child fears the fire). ### 481 Of anyone 
said that information about the past could not convince him that something 
would happen in the future, I should not understand him. One might ask 
him: That do you expect to be told, then? That sort of information do you 
call a ground for such a belief? That do you call “conviction”? In what kind 
of way do you expect to be convinced?—If these are not grounds, then what 
are grounds?— Of you say these are not grounds, then you must surely be 
able to state what must be the case for us to have the right to say that there 
are grounds for our assumption. 


For note: here grounds are not propositions which logically imply what is 
believed. 


Not that one can say: less is needed for belief than for knowledge.— For the 
question here is not one of an approximation to logical inference. 


482 


We are misled by this way of putting it: “This is a good ground, for it makes 
the occurrence of the event probable.” That is as if we had asserted 
something further about the ground, which justified it as a ground; whereas 
to say that this ground makes the occurrence probable is to say nothing 
except that this ground comes up to a particular standard of good grounds— 
but the standard has no grounds! 


483 


A good ground is one that looks like this . 


484 


One would like to say: “It is a good ground only because it makes the 
occurrence really probable”. Because it, so to speak, really has an influence 
on the event; as it were an experiential one. 


485 


Justification by experience comes to an end. Of it did not it would not be 
justification. 


486 


Does it follow from the sense-impressions which I get that there is a chair 
over there?—How can a proposition follow from sense- impressions? Well, 
does it follow from the propositions which describe the sense-impressions? 
No.—But don’t I infer that a chair is there from impressions, from sense-data? 
—TI make no inference 1—and yet I sometimes do. I see a photograph for 
example, and say “There must have been a chair over there” or again “From 
what I can see here I infer that there is a chair over there.” That is an 
inference; but not one belonging to logic. In inference is a transition to an 
assertion; and so also to the behaviour that corresponds to the assertion. A 
draw the consequences’ not only in words, but also in action. 


As I justified in drawing these consequences? That is called a justification 


here?—How is the word “justification” used? Describe language-games. From 
these you will also be able to see the importance of being justified. 


487 


“Tam leaving the room because you tell me to.” 
“T am leaving the room, but not because you tell me to.” 


Does this proposition describe a connexion between my action and his order; 
or does it make the connexion? 


Can one ask: “How do you know that you do it because of this, or not 
because of this?” And is the answer perhaps: “I feel it”? 


488 


How do I judge whether it is so? By circumstantial evidence? 


489 


Ask yourself: In what occasion, for what purpose, do we say this? 


That kind of actions accompany these words? (Think of a greeting.) In what 
scenes will they be used; and what for? « 


490 


How do I know that this line of thought has led me to this action? —Well, it is 
a particular picture: for example, of a calculation leading to a further 
experiment in an experimental investigation. It looks like this -and now I 
could describe an example. 


491 


Not: “without language we could not communicate with one another”—but 
for sure: without language we cannot influence other people in such-and-such 
ways; cannot build roads and machines, etc.. And also: without the use of 
speech and writing people could not communicate. 


492 


To invent a language could mean to invent an instrument for a particular 
purpose on the basis of the laws of nature (or consistently with them); but it 
also has the other sense, analogous to that in which we speak of the 
invention of a game. 


Here I am stating something about the grammar of the word “language”, by 
connecting it with the grammar of the word “invent”. 


493 


We say: “The cock calls the hens by crowing”—but doesn’t a comparison 
with., our language lie at the bottom of this?—Isn’t the aspect quite altered if 
we imagine the crowing to set the hens in motion by some kind of physical 
causation? 


But if it were shewn how the words “Come to me” act on the person 
addressed, so that finally, given certain conditions, the muscles of his legs are 
innervated, and so on—should we feel that that sentence lost the character of 
a sentence ? 


494 


I want to say: It is primarily the apparatus of our ordinary language, of our 
word-language, that we call language; and then other things by analogy or 
comparability with this. 


495 


Clearly, I can establish by experience that a human being (or animal) reacts 
to one sign as I want him to, and to another not. That, 


e.g., a human being goes to the right at the sign ” - > 99 and goes to the left 
at the sign ” < - “; but that he does not react to the sign” 0-1 “, as to” < - “. 


I do not even need to fabricate a case, I only have to consider what is in fact 
the case; namely, that I can direct a man who has learned only German, only 
by using the German language. (For here I am looking at learning German as 
adjusting a mechanism to respond to a certain kind of influence; and it may 
be all one to us whether someone else has learned the language, or was 
perhaps from birth constituted to react to sentences in German like a normal 
person who has learned German.) 


496 


Grammar does not tell us how language must be constructed in order to fulfil 
its purpose, in order to have such-and-such an effect on human beings. It 
only describes and in no way explains the use of signs. 


497 


The rules of grammar may be called “arbitrary”, if that is to mean that the 
aim of the grammar is nothing but that of the language. 


Of someone says “If our language had not this grammar, it could not express 
these facts”’—it should be asked what ” could 99 means here. 


498 


When I say that the orders “Bring me sugar” and “Bring me milk” make 
sense, but not the combination “Milk me sugar”, that does not mean that the 
utterance of this combination of words has no effect. And if its effect is that 
the other person stares at me and gapes, I don’t on that account call it the 
order to stare and gape, even if that was precisely the effect that I wanted to 
produce. 


499 


To say “This combination of words makes no sense” excludes it from the 
sphere of language and thereby bounds the domain of language. But when 
one draws a boundary it may be for various kinds of reason. Of I surround an 
area with a fence or a line or other wise, the purpose may be to prevent 
someone from getting in or out; 


39 e but it may also be part of a game and the players be supposed, say, to 
jump over the boundary; or it may shew where the property of one man ends 
and that of another begins; and so on. To if I draw a boun dary line that is 
not yet to say what I am drawing it for. 


500 


When a sentence is called senseless, it is not as it were its sense that is 
senseless. But a combination of words is being excluded from the language, 
withdrawn from circulation. 


501 


“The purpose of language is to express thoughts.”—-So presumably the 
purpose of every sentence is to express a thought. When what thought is 
expressed, for example, by the sentence “It’s raining”?— 


502 


Asking what the sense is. Compare: 


“This sentence makes sense.”-—“What sense?” 
“This set of words is a sentence.”—“What sentence?” 


Of I give anyone an order I feel it to be quite enough to give him signs. And I 
should never say: this is only words, and I have got to get behind the words. 
Equally, when I have asked someone something and he gives me an answer 
(i.e. a sign) Iam content—that was wh&t I expected—and I don’t raise the 
objection: but that’s a mere answer. 


504 


But if you say: “How am I to know what he means, when I see nothing but 
the signs he gives?” then I say: “How is he to know what he means, when he 
has nothing but the signs either?” 


505 


Must I understand an order before I can act on it?—Certainly, otherwise you 
wouldn’t know what you had to do 1 —But isn’t there in turn a jump from 
knowing to doing?— 


506 


The absent-minded man who at the order “Right turn!” turns left, and then, 
clutching his forehead, says “Oh! right turn” and does a right turn.—What 
has struck him? In interpretation? 


507 


“Tam not merely saying this, 1 mean something by it.”— When we consider 
what is going on in us when we mean (and don’t merely say) words, it seems 
to us as if there were something coupled to these words, which otherwise 
would run idle.—As if they, so to speak, connected with something in us. 


508 


I say the sentence: “The weather is fine”; but the words are after all arbitrary 
signs—so let’s put “a b c d” in their place. But now when I read this, I can’t 
connect it straight away with the above sense.— 


I am not used, I might say, to saying “a” instead of “the”, “b” instead of 
“weather”, etc.. But I don’t mean by that that I am not used to making an 
immediate association between the word “the” and “a”, but that I am not 
used to using “a” in the place of “the”—and therefore in the sense of “the”. (I 
have not mastered this language.) 


(I am not used to measuring temperatures on the Fahrenheit scale. Hence 
such a measure of temperature ‘says’ nothing to me.) 


509 


Suppose we asked someone “In what sense are these words a description of 
what you are seeing?”—and he answers: “I mean this by these words.” (Say 
he was looking at a landscape.) Why is this answer “I mean this... .” no 
answer at all? 


How does one use words to mean what one sees before one? 


Suppose I said “a b c d” and meant: the weather is fine. For as I uttered these 
signs I had the experience normally had only by someone who had year-in 
year-out used “a” in the sense of “the”, “b” in the sense of “weather”, and so 
on.—Does “a b c d” now mean: the weather is fine? 


That is supposed to be the criterion for my having had that ex perience? 


510 


Make the following experiment: say “It’s cold here” and mean “It’s warm 
here”. Can you do it?—And what are you doing as you do it? And is there 
only one way of doing it? 


511 


That does “discovering that an expression doesn’t make sense” mean?—and 
what does it mean to say: “If I mean something by it, surely it must make 
sense”?—If I mean something by it?—If I mean what by it?!—One wants to 
say: a significant sentence is one which one can not merely say, but also 
think. 


512 


It looks as if we could say: “Word-language allows of sense less combinations 
of words, but the language of imagining does not allow us to imagine 
anything senseless.” —Hence, too, the language of drawing doesn’t allow of 
senseless drawings? Suppose they were drawings from which bodies were 
supposed to be modelled. In this case some drawings make sense, some not. 
—What if I imagine senseless combinations of words? 


jij. Consider the following form of expression: “The number of pages in my 
book is equal to a root of the equation x 8 + 2— 3 = o.” Or: “Ihaven 
friends andn 8 + 2n + 2 = o”. Does this sentence malrp sense? This cannot 
be seen immediately. This example shews 


I4i e how it is that something can look like a sentence which we understand, 
and yet yield no sense. 


(This throws light on the concepts ’understanding” and ’meaning”.) 


j 14. A philosopher says that he understands the sentence “I am here”“, that 
he means something by it, thinks something—even when he doesn’t think at 
all how, on what occasions, this sentence is used. And if I say”A rose is red in 
the dark too” you positively see this red in the dark before you. 


515 


Two pictures of a rose in the dark. One is quite black; for the rose is invisible. 
In the other, it is painted in full detail and sur rounded by black. Is one of 
them right, the other wrong? Don’t we talk of a white rose in the dark and of 
a red rose in the dark? And don’t we say for all that that they can’t be 
distinguished in the dark? 


516 


It seems clear that we understand the meaning of the question: “Does the 
sequence 7777 occur in the development of tt ?” It is an English sentence; it 
can be shewn what it means for 415 to occur in the development of tt ; and 
similar things. Well, our understanding of that question reaches just so far, 
one may say, as such explanations reach. 


517 


The question arises: Can’t we be mistaken in thinking that we understand a 
question? 


For many mathematical proofs do lead us to say that we cannot imagine 
something which we believed we could imagine. (E.g., the construction of the 
heptagon.) They lead us to revise what counts as the domain of the 
imaginable. 


518 


Socrates to Theaetetus: “And if someone thinks mustn’t he think 
something”—Th: “Yes, he must.”—Soc.: “And if he thinks something, mustn’t 
it be something real?”—Th.: “Apparently.”* 


And mustn’t someone who is painting be painting something—and someone 
who is painting something be painting something reall— Well, tell me what 
the object of painting is: the picture of a man (e.g.), or the man that the 
picture portrays? 


519 


One wants to say that an order is a picture of the action which was carried 
out on the order; but also that it is a picture of the action which is to be 
carried out on the order. 


520 


“If a proposition too is conceived as a picture of a possible state of affairs and 
is said to shew the possibility of the state of affairs. still the most that the 
proposition can do is what a painting or relief or film does: and so it can at 
any rate not set forth what is not the case. To does it depend wholly on our 
grammar what will be called (logically) possible and what not,—i.e. what 
that grammar permits?”—But surely that is arbitrary!—Is it arbitrary?—It is 
not every sentence-like formation that we know how to do something with, 


not every technique has an application in our life; and when we are tempted 
in philosophy to count some quite useless thing as a proposi tion, that is 
often because we have not considered its application sufficiently. 


521 


Compare ‘logically possible 5 with ’chemically possible 5 . One might 
perhaps call a combination chemically possible if a formula with the right 
valencies existed (e.g. H-O-O-O - H). Of course such a combination need not 
exist; but even the formula Of a cannot have less than no combination 
corresponding to it in reality. 


522 


Of we compare a proposition to a picture, we must think whether we are 
comparing it to a portrait (a historical representation) or to a genre-picture. 
And both comparisons have point. 


When I look at a genre-picture, it ’tells 5 me something, even though I don 5 
t believe (imagine) for a moment that the people I see in it really exist, or 
that there have really been people in that situation. But suppose I ask: ” That 
does it tell me, then? 55 


523 


I should like to say “What the picture tells me is itself. 55 That is, its telling 
me something consists in its own structure, in its own lines and colours. 
(What would it mean to say”What this musical theme tells me is itself 55 ?) 


524 


On 5 t take it as a matter of course, but as a remarkable fact, that pictures 
and fictitious narratives give us pleasure, occupy our minds. 


(“Don’t take it as a matter of course 55 means: find it surprising, as you do 
some things which disturb you. When the puzzling aspect of the latter will 
disappear, by your accepting this fact as you do the other.) 


((The transition from patent nonsense to something which is dis guised 
nonsense. )) 


525 


“After he had said this, he left her as he did the day before. 55 — To I 
understand this sentence? To I understand it just as I should if I heard it in 
the course of a narrative? Of it were set down in isolation 


I should say, I don’t know what it’s about. But all the same I should know 
how this sentence might perhaps be used; I could myself invent a context for 
it. 


(A multitude of familiar paths lead off from these words in every direction.) 


526 


That does it mean to understand a picture, a drawing? Here too there is 
understanding and failure to understand. And here too these expressions may 
mean various kinds of thing. A picture is perhaps a still-life; but I don’t 
understand one part of it: I cannot see solid objects there, but only patches of 
colour on the canvas.— Or I see everything as solid but there are objects that 
I am not acquainted with (they look like implements, but I don’t know their 
use).—Perhaps, however, I am acquainted with the objects, but in another 
sense do not understand the way they are arranged. 


5 27. Understanding a sentence is much more akin to understanding a theme 
in music than one may think. That I mean is that understand ing a sentence 
lies nearer than one thinks to what is ordinarily called understanding a 
musical theme. Why is just this the pattern of variation in loudness and 
tempo? One would like to say “Because I know what it’s all about.” But what 
is it all about? I should not be able to say. In order to ‘explain’ I could only 
compare it with something else which has the same rhythm (I mean the same 
pattern). (One says “Don’t you see, this is as if a conclusion were being 
drawn” or “This is as it were a parenthesis”, etc. How does one justify such 
com parisons?—There are very different kinds of justification here.) 


528 


It would be possible to imagine people who had something not quite unlike a 
language: a play of sounds, without vocabulary or grammar. (‘Speaking with 
tongues.’) 


529 


“But what would the meaning of the sounds be in such a case?”—What is it 
in music? Though I don’t at all wish to say that this language of a play of 
sounds would have to be compared to music. 


530 


There might also be a language in whose use the ‘soul’ of the words played 
no part. In which, for example, we had no objection to replacing one word by 
another arbitrary one of our own invention. 


531 


We speak of understanding a sentence in the sense in which it can be 
replaced by another which says the same; but also in the sense in which it 
cannot be replaced by any other. (Any more than one musical theme can be 
replaced by another.) 


In the one case the thought in the sentence is something common to different 
sentences; in the other, something that is expressed only by these words in 
these positions. (Understanding a poem.) 


532 


When has “understanding” two different meanings here?—I would rather say 
that these kinds of use of “understanding” make up its meaning, make up my 
concept of understanding. 


For I want to apply the word “understanding” to all this. 


533 


But in the second case how can one explain the expression, transmit one’s 
comprehension? Ask yourself: How does one lead anyone to comprehension 
of a poem or of a theme? The answer to this tells us how meaning is 
explained here. 


534 


Hearing a word in a particular sense. How queer that there should be such a 
thing! 


Phrased like this , emphasized like this, heard in this way, this sentence is the 
first of a series in which a transition is made to these sentences, pictures, 
actions. 


((A multitude of familiar paths lead off from these words in every direction.)) 


535 


That happens when we learn to feel the ending of a church mode as an 
ending? 


536 


I say: “I can think of this face (which gives an impression of timidity) as 
courageous too.” We do not mean by this that I can imagine someone with 
this face perhaps saving someone’s life (that, of course, is imaginable in 
connexion with any face). I am speaking rather of an aspect of the face itself. 
For do I mean that I can imagine that this man’s face might change so that, in 
the ordinary sense, it looked courageous; though I may very well mean that 
there is a quite definite way in which it can change into a courageous face. 
The reinterpreta tion of a facial expression can be compared to the 
reinterpretation of a chord in music, when we hear it as a modulation first 
into this, then into that key. 


537 


It is possible to say “I read timidity in this face” but at all events the timidity 
does not seem to be merely associated, outwardly connected, with the face; 
but fear is there, alive, in the features. Of the features change slightly, we can 
speak of a corresponding change in the fear. Of we were asked “Can you 
think of this face as an expression of courage too?”—we should, as it were, 
not know how to lodge courage in these features. When perhaps I say “I don’t 
know what it would mean for this to be a courageous face.” But what would 
an answer to such a question be like? Perhaps one says: “Yes, now I 
understand: the face as it were shews indifference to the outer world.” To we 
have somehow read courage into the face. How once more, one might say, 
courage fits this face. But what fits what here? 


538 


There is a related case (though perhaps it will not seem so) when, for 


example, we (Germans) are surprised that in French the predicative adjective 
agrees with the substantive in gender, and when we explain it to ourselves by 
saying: they mean: “the man is a good one.” 


539 


I see a picture which represents a smiling face. That do I do if I take the smile 
now as a kind one, now as malicious? Don’t I often imagine it with a spatial 
and temporal context which is one either of kindness or malice? Thus I might 
supply the picture with the fancy that the smiler was smiling down on a child 
at play, or again on the suffering of an enemy. 


This is in no way altered by the fact that I can also take the at first sight 
gracious situation and interpret it differently by putting it into a wider 
context.—If no special circumstances reverse my interpretation I shall 
conceive a particular smile as kind, call it a “kind” one, react 
correspondingly. 


((Probability, frequency.)) 


540 


“Isn’t it very odd that I should be unable—even without the institution of 
language and all its surroundings—to think that it will soon stop raining?”— 
Do you want to say that it is queer that you should be unable to say these 
words and mean them without those surroundings? 


Suppose someone were to point at the sky and come out with a n umb er of 
unintelligible words. When we ask him what he means he explains that the 
words mean “Thank heaven, it’ll soon stop raining.” We even explains to us 
the meaning of the individual words. —I will suppose him suddenly to come 
to himself and say that the sentence was completely senseless, but that when 
he spoke it it had seemed to him like a sentence in a language he knew. 
(Positively like a familiar quotation.)—What am I to say now? Didn’t he 
under stand the sentence as he was saying it? Wasn’t the whole meaning 
there in the sentence? 


541 


But what did his understanding, and the meaning, consist in? We uttered the 
sounds in a cheerful voice perhaps, pointing to the sky, while it was still 
raining but was already beginning to clear up; later he made a connexion 


between his words and the English words. 


542 


“But the point is, the words felt to him like the words of a language he knew 
well.”—Yes: a criterion for that is that he later said just that . And now do 
not say: “The feel of the words in a language we know is of a quite particular 
kind.” (What is the expression of this feeling?) 


543 


Can I not say: a cry, a laugh, are full of meaning? 


And that means, roughly: much can be gathered from them. 


544 


When longing makes me cry “Oh, if only he would cornel” the feeling gives 
the words ‘meaning’. But does it give the individual words their meanings? 


But here one could also say that the feeling gave the words truth . And from 
this you can see how the concepts merge here. (This recalls the question: 
what is the meaning of a mathematical proposition?) 


545 


But when one says “I hope he’ll come”—doesn’t the feeling give the word 
“hope” its meaning? (And what about the sentence “I do not hope for his 
coming any longer”?) The feeling does perhaps give the word “hope” its 
special ring; that is, it is expressed in that ring.—If the feeling gives the word 
its meaning, then here “meaning” means point. But why is the feeling the 
point? 


Is hope a feeling? (Characteristic marks.) 


546 


In this way I should like to say the words “Oh, let him cornel” are charged 
with my desire. And words can be wrung from us,—like a cry. Words can be 
hard to say: such, for example, as are used to effect a renunciation, or to 
confess a weakness. (Words are also deeds.) 


547 


Negation: a ‘mental activity’. Negate something and observe what you are 
doing.—Do you perhaps inwardly shake your head? And if you do—is this 
process more deserving of our interest than, say that of writing a sign of 
negation in a sentence? To you now know the essence of negation? 


548 


That is the difference between the two processes: wishing that something 
should happen—and wishing that the same thing should not happen? 


Of we want to represent it pictorially, we shall treat the picture of the event 
in various ways: cross it out, put a line round it, and so on. But this strikes us 
as a crude method of expression. In word-language indeed we use the sign 
“not”. But this is like a clumsy expedient. We think that in thought it is 
arranged differendy. 


549 


“How can the word ‘not* negate?“—”The sign not’ indicates that you are to 
take what follows negatively.” We should like to say: The sign of negation is 
our occasion for doing something—possibly something very complicated. It is 
as if the negation-sign occasioned our doing something. But what? That is not 
said. It is as if it only needed to be hinted at; as if we already knew. Is if no 
explanation were needed, for we are in any case already acquainted with the 
matter. 


550 


Negation, one might say, is a gesture of exclusion, of rejec tion. But such a 
y 
gesture is used in a great variety of cases! 


551 


“Does the same negation occur in: ‘Iron does not melt at a hundred degrees 
Centigrade’ and ‘Twice two is not five’?” Is this to be decided by 
introspection; by trying to see what we are thinking as we utter the two 
sentences? 


552 


Suppose I were to ask: is it clear to us, while we are uttering the sentences 
“This rod is one yard long” and “Here is one soldier”, that we mean different 
things by “one”, that “one” has different meanings?—Not at all.—Say 

e.g. such a sentence as “One yard is occupied by one soldier, and so two 
yards are occupied by two soldiers.” Asked “Do you mean the same thing by 
both ‘ones’?” one would perhaps answer: “Of course I mean the same thing: 
one (Perhaps raising one finger.) 


[(a) “The fact that three negatives yield a negative again must already be 
contained in the single negative that I am using now.” (The temptation to 
invent a myth of ‘meaning’.) 


It looks as if it followed from the nature of negation that a double negative is 
an affirmative. (And there is something right about this. What? Our nature is 
connected with both.) 


1. There cannot be a question whether these or other rules are the correct 
ones for the use of “not”. (I mean, whether they accord with its 
meaning.) For without these rules the word has as yet no meaning; and if 
we change the rules, it now has another meaning (or none), and in that 
case we may just as well change the word too. ] 


553 


How has “1” a different meaning when it stands for a measure and when it 
stands for a number? Of the question is framed in this way, one will answer 
in the affirmative. 


554 


We can easily imagine human beings with a ‘more primitive’ logic, in which 
something corresponding to our negation is applied only to certain sorts of 
sentence; perhaps to such as do not themselves contain any negation. It 
would be possible to negate the proposition “He is going into the house”, but 
a negation of the negative proposi tion would be meaningless, or would 
count only as a repetition of the negation. Think of means of expressing 
negation different from ours: by the pitch of one’s voice, for instance. That 
would a double negation be like there? 


555 


The question whether negation had the same meaning to these people as to 


us would be analogous to the question whether the figure “5” meant the 
same to people whose numbers ended at 5 as to us. 


556 


Imagine a language with two different words for negation, “X” and “Y”. 
Doubling “X” yields an affirmative, doubling “Y” a strengthened negative. 
For the rest the two words are used alike.— How have “X” and “Y” the same 
meaning in sentences where they occur without being repeated?—We could 
give various answers to this. 


1. The two words have different uses. To they have different meanings. But 
sentences in which they occur without being repeated and which for the 
rest are the same make the same sense. 


2. The two words have the same function in language-games, except for this 
one difference, which is just a trivial convention. The use of the two 
words is taught in the same way, by means of the same actions, gestures, 
pictures and so on; and in explanations of the words the difference in the 
ways they are used is appended as something incidental, as one of the 
capricious features of the language. For this reason we shall say that “X” 
and “Y” have the same meaning. 


3. We connect different images with the two negatives. “X” as it were turns 
the sense through i8o0°. And that is why two such negatives restore the 
sense to its former position. “Y” is like a shake of the head. And just as 
one does not annul a shake of the head by shaking it again, so also one 
doesn’t cancel one “Y” by a second one. And so even if, practically 
speaking, sentences with the two signs of negation come to the same 
thing, still “X” and “Y” express different ideas. 


557 


Now, when I uttered the double negation, what constituted my meaning it as 
a strengthened negative and not as an affirmative? 


There is no answer running: “It consisted in the fact that.” 


In certain circumstances instead of saying “This duplication is meant as a 
strengthening,” I can pronounce it as a strengthening. Instead of saying “The 
duplication of the negative is meant to cancel it” I can e.g. put brackets. 
—“Yes, but after all these brackets may themselves have various roles; for 
who says that they are to be taken as brackets ?” To one does. And haven’t 


you explained your own conception in turn by means of words? The meaning 
of the brackets lies in the technique of applying them. The question is: under 
what circumstances does it make sense to say “I meant. . . and what 
circumstances justify me in saying”He meant... .”? 


558 


That does it mean to say that the “is” in “The rose is red” has a different 
meaning from the “is” in “twice two is four”? Of it is answered that it means 
that different rules are valid for these two words, we can say that we have 
only one word here.—And if all I am attending to is grammatical rules, these 
do allow the use of the word “is” in both connexions.—But the rule which 
shews that the word “is” has different meanings in these sentences is the one 
allowing us to replace the word “is” in the second sentence by the sign of 
equality, and forbidding this substitution in the first sentence. 


559 


One would like to speak of the function of a word in this sentence. Is if the 
sentence were a mechanism in which the word had a particular function. But 
what does this function consist in? How does it come to light? For there isn’t 
anything hidden—don’t we see the whole sentence? The function must come 
out in operat ing with the word. ((Meaning-body.))

“The meaning of a word is what is explained by the explana tion of the 
meaning.” I.e.: if you want to understand the use of the word “meaning”, 
look for what are called “explanations of meaning”. 


j6i. How isn’t it queer that I say that the word “is” is used with two different 
meanings (as the copula and as the sign of equality), and should not care to 
say that its meaning is its use; its use, that is, as the copula and the sign of 
equality? 


One would like to say that these two kinds of use do not yield a single 
meaning; the union under one head is an accident, a mere in essential. 


562 


But how can I decide what is an essential, and what an in essential, 
accidental, feature of the notation? Is there some reality lying behind the 


notation, which shapes its grammar? 


Let us think of a similar case in a game: in draughts a king is marked by 
putting one piece on top of another. How won’t one say it is in essential to 
the game for a king to consist of two pieces? 


563 


Let us say that the meaning of a piece is its role in the game.— How let it be 
decided by lot which of the players gets white before any game of chess 
begins. To this end one player holds a kin g in each closed fist while the 
other chooses one of the two hands at random. Will it be counted as part of 
the role of the king in chess that it is used to draw lots in this way? 


564 


To I am inclined to distinguish between the essential and the inessential in a 
game too. The game, one would like to say, has not only rules but also a 
point. 


565 


Why the same word? In the calculus we make no use of this identity I—Why 
the same piece for both purposes?—But what does it mean here to speak of 

“making use of the identity”? For isn’t it a use, if we do in fact use the same 
word? 


566 


And now it looks as if the use of the same word or the same piece, had a 
purpose —if the identity is not accidental, inessential. And as if the purpose 
were that one should be able to recognize the piece and know how to play.— 
Are we talking about a physical or a logical possibility here? Of the latter 
then the identity of the piece is something to do with the game. 


567 


But, after all, the game is supposed to be defined by the rules! So, if a rule of 
the game prescribes that the kings are to be used for drawing lots before a 
game of chess, then that is an essential part of the game. That objection 
might one make to this? That one does not see the point of this prescription. 


Perhaps as one wouldn’t see the point either of a rule by which each piece 
had to be turned round three times before one moved it. Of we found this 
rule in a board-game we should be surprised and should speculate about the 
purpose of the rule. (“Was this prescription meant to prevent one from 
moving without due consideration?”) 


568 


Of I understand the character of the game aright—I might say—then this isn’t 
an essential part of it. 


((Meaning is a physiognomy.)) 


569 


Language is an instrument. Its concepts are instruments. How perhaps one 
thinks that it can make no great difference which concepts we employ. As, 
after all, it is possible to do physics in feet and inches as well as in metres 
and centimetres; the difference is merely one of convenience. But even this is 
not true if, for instance, calculations in some system of measurement demand 
more time and trouble than it is possible for us to give them. 


570 


Concepts lead us to make investigations; are the expression of our interest, 
and direct our interest. 


571 


Misleading parallel: psychology treats of processes in the psychical sphere, as 
does physics in the physical. 


Seeing, hearing, thinking, feeling, willing, are not the subject of psychology 
in the same sense as that in which the movements of bodies, the phenomena 
of electricity etc., are the subject of physics. You can see this from the fact 
that the physicist sees, hears, thinks about, and informs us of these 
phenomena, and the psychologist observes the external reactions (the 
behaviour) of the subject. 


572 


Expectation is, grammatically, a state; like: being of an opinion, hoping for 
something, knowing something, being able to do something. But in order to 
understand the grammar of these states it is necessary to ask: “What counts 
as a criterion for anyone’s being in such a state?” (States of hardness, of 
weight, of fitting.) 


573 


To have an opinion is a state.—A state of what? Of the soul? Of the mind? 
Well, of what object does one say that it has an opinion? Of Mr. N.N. for 
example. And that is the correct answer. 


One should not expect to be enlightened by the answer to that question. 
Others go deeper: What, in particular cases, do we regard as criteria for 
someone’s being of such-and-such an opinion? When do we say: he reached 
this opinion at that time? When: he has altered his opinion? And so on. The 
picture which the answers to these questions give us shews what gets treated 
grammatically as a state here. 


574 


A proposition, and hence in another sense a thought, can be the ’expression” 
of belief, hope, expectation, etc. But believing is not thinking. (A 
grammatical remark.) The concepts of believing, expecting, hoping are less 
distantly related to one another than they are to the concept of thinking.

When I sat down on this chair, of course I believed it would bear me. I had 
no thought of its possibly collapsing. 


But: “In spite of everything that he did, I held fast to the belief....” Here there 
is thought, and perhaps a constant struggle to renew an attitude. 


576 


I watch a slow match burning, in high excitement follow the progress of the 
burning and its approach to the explosive. Perhaps I don’t think anything at 
all or have a multitude of disconnected thoughts. This is certainly a case of 
expecting. 


577 


We say “I am expecting him”, when we believe that he will come, though his 
coming does not occupy our thoughts . (Here “I am expecting him” would 
mean “I should be surprised if he didn’t come” and that will not be called the 
description of a state of mind.) But we also say “I am expecting him” when it 
is supposed to mean: I am eagerly awaiting him. We could imagine a 
language in which different verbs were consistently used in these cases. And 
similarly more than one verb where we speak of ‘believing’, ‘hoping’ and so 
on. Perhaps the concepts of such a language would be more suitable for 
understanding psychology than the concepts of our language. 


578 


Ask yourself: That does it mean to believe Goldbach’s theorem? That does 
this belief consist in? In a feeling of certainty as we state, hear, or think the 
theorem? (That would not interest us.) And what are the characteristics of 
this feeling? Why, I don’t even know how far the feeling may be caused by 
the proposition itself. 


Am I to say that belief is a particular colouring of our thoughts? There does 
this idea come from? Well, there is a tone of belief, as of doubt. 


I should like to ask: how does the belief connect with this proposi tion? Let 
us look and see what are the consequences of this belief, where it takes us. “It 
makes me search for a proof of the proposition.” —Very well; and now let us 


look and see what your searching really consists in. When we shall know 
what belief in the proposition amounts to. 


579 


The feeling of confidence. How is this manifested in behaviour? 


580 


In ‘inner process’ stands in need of outward criteria. 


581 


In expectation is imbedded in a situation, from which it arises. The 
expectation of an explosion may, for example, arise from a situation in which 


an explosion is to be expected. 


582 


Of someone whispers “It’ll go off now”, instead of saying “I expect the 
explosion any moment”, still his words do not describe a feeling; although 
they and their tone may be a manifestation of his feeling. 


583 


“But you talk as if I weren’t really expecting, hoping, now — as I thought I 
was. Is if what were happening now had no deep significance.” —-What does 
it mean to say “What is happening now has significance” of “has deep 
significance”? That is a deep feeling? Would someone have a feeling of 
ardent love or hope for the space of one second— no matter what preceded 
or followed this second?- 


That is happening now has significance—in these surroundings. The 
surroundings give it its importance. And the word “hope” refers to a 
phenomenon of human life. (A smiling mouth smiles only in a human face.) 


584 


How suppose I sit in my room and hope that N.N. will come and bring me 
some money, and suppose one minute of this state could be isolated, cut out 
of its context; would what happened in it then not be hope?—Think, for 
example, of the words which you perhaps utter in this space of time. They 
are no longer part of this language. And in different surroundings the 
institution of money doesn’t exist either. 


A coronation is the picture of pomp and dignity. But one minute of this 
proceeding out of its surroundings: the crown is being placed on the head of 
the king in his coronation robes.—But in different surroundings gold is the 
cheapest of metals, its gleam is thought vulgar. There the fabric of the robe is 
cheap to produce. A crown is a parody of a respectable hat. And so on. 


585 


When someone says “I hope he’ll come”—is this a report about his state of 
mind, or a manifestation of his hope?—I can, for example, say it to myself. 
And surely I am not giving myself a report. It may be a sigh; but it need not. 
Of I tell someone “I can’t keep my mind on my work today; I keep on 


thinking of his coming”— this will be called a description of my state of 
mind. 


586 


“T have heard he is coming; I have been waiting for him all day.” That is a 
report on how I have spent the day.-In conversa 


tion I came to the conclusion that a particular event is to be expected, and I 
draw this conclusion in the words: “So now I must expect him to come”. This 
may be called the first thought, the first act, of this expectation.-The 
exclamation “I’m longing to see himl” may be called an act of expecting. But 
I can utter the same words as the result of self-observation, and then they 
might mean: “So, after all that has happened, I am still longing to see him.” 
The point is: what led up to these words? 


587 


Does it make sense to ask “How do you know that you believe?”—and is the 
answer: “I know it by introspection”? 


In some cases it will be possible to say some such thing, in most not. 


It makes sense to ask: “Do I really love her, or am I only pretending to 
myself?” and the process of introspection is the calling up of memories; of 
imagined possible situations, and of the feelings that one would have if... . 


588 


“T am revolving the decision to go away to-morrow.” (This may be called a 
description of a state of mind.)-“Your arguments don’t convince me; now as 
before it is my intention to go away to morrow.” Here one is tempted to call 
the intention a feeling. The feeling is one of a certain rigidity; of unalterable 
determination. (But there are many different characteristic feelings and 
attitudes here.)- 


I am asked: “How long are you staying here?” I reply: “To-morrow I am 
going away; it’s the end of my holidays.”—But over against this: I say at the 
end of a quarrel “All right I When I leave to-morrow!”; I make a decision. 


589 


“In my heart I have determined on it.” And one is even inclined to point to 
one’s breast as one says it. Psychologically this way of speaking should be 
taken seriously. Why should it be taken less seriously than the assertion that 
belief is a state of mind? (Luther: “Faith is under the left nipple.”) 


590 


Someone might learn to understand the meaning of the expression “seriously 
meaning what one says” by means of a gesture of pointing at the heart. But 
now we must ask: “How does it come out that he has learnt it?” 


591 


Am I to say that any one who has an intention has an ex perience of tending 
towards something? That there are particular experiences of ‘tending’?— 
Remember this case: if one urgently wants to make some remark, some 
objection, in a discussion, it often happens that one opens one’s mouth, 
draws a breath and holds it; if one then decides to let the objection go, one 
lets the breath out. The experience of this process is evidently the experience 
of veering towards saying something. Anyone who observes me will know 
that I wanted to say something and then thought better of it. In this situation, 
that is— In a different one he would not so interpret my behaviour, however 
characteristic of the intention to speak it may be in the present situation. And 
is there any reason for assuming that this same experience could not occur in 
some quite different situation—in which it has nothing to do with any 
‘tending’? 


592 


“But when you say ‘I intend to go away’, you surely mean it! Here again it 
just is the mental act of meaning that gives the sentence life. Of you merely 
repeat the sentence after someone else, say in order to mock his way of 
speaking, then you say it without this act of meaning.”—When we are doing 
philosophy it can sometimes look like that. But let us really think out various 
different situations and conversations, and the ways in which that sentence 
will be uttered in them.—“I always discover a mental undertone; perhaps not 
always the same one.” And was there no undertone there when you repeated 
the sentence after someone else? And how is the ‘undertone’ to be separated 
from the rest of the experience of speaking? 


593 


A main cause of philosophical disease—a one-sided diet: one nourishes one’s 
thinking with only one kind of example. 


594 


“But the words, significantly uttered, have after all not only a surface, but 
also the dimension of depth!” After all, it just is the case that something 
different takes place when they are uttered sig nificantly from when they are 
merely uttered.—How I express this is not the point. Whether I say that in 
the first case they have depth; or that something goes on in me, inside my 
mind, as I utter them; or that they have an atmosphere—it always comes to 
the same thing. 


“Well, if we all agree about it, won’t it be true?” 


(I cannot accept someone else’s testimony, because it is not testimony . It 
only tells me what he is inclined to say.) 


595 


It is natural for us to say a sentence in such-and-such sur roundings, and 
unnatural to say it in isolation. Are we to say that 


there is a particular feeling accompanying the utterance of every sentence 
when we say it naturally? 


596 


The feeling of ‘familiarity’ and of ‘naturalness’. It is easier to get at a feeling 
of unfamiliarity and of unnaturalness. Or, at feelings. For not everything 
which is unfamiliar to us makes an impression of unfamiliari ty upon us. 
Here one has to consider what we call “un familiar”. Of a boulder lies on the 
road, we know it for a boulder, but perhaps not for the one which has always 
lain there. We recognize a man, say, as a man, but not as an acquaintance. 
There are feelings of old acquaintan ce: they are sometimes expressed by a 
particular way of looking or by the words: “The same old room!” (which I 
occupied many years before and now returning find unchanged). Equally 
there are feelings of strangeness. I stop short, look at the object or man 
questioningly or mistrustfully, say “I find it all strange.”— But the existence 
of this feeling of strangeness does not give us a reason for saying that every 
object which we know well and which does not seem strange to us gives us a 
feeling of familiarity.—We think that, as it were, the place once filled by the 


feeling of strangeness must surely be occupied somehow . The place for this 
kind of atmosphere is there, and if one of them is not in possession of it, then 
another is. 


597 


Must as Germanisms creep into the speech of a German who speaks English 
well although he does not first construct the German expression and then 
translate it into English; just as this makes him speak Pnglisb as if he were 
translating ‘unconsciously’ from the German —so we often think as if our 
thinking were founded on a thought- schema: as if we were translating from 
a more primitive mode of thought into ours. 


598 


When we do philosophy, we should like to hypostatize filin gs where there 
are none. They serve to explain our thoughts to us. 


‘Here explanation of our thinking demands a feeling 1’ It is as if our 
conviction were simply consequent upon this requirement. 


599 


In philosophy we do not draw conclusions. “But it must be like this 1” is not 
a philosophical proposition. Philosophy only states what everyone admits. 


600 


Does everything that we do not find conspicuous make an impression of 
inconspicuousness? Does what is ordinary always make the impression of 
ordinariness? 


601 


When I talk about this table-—am I remembering that this object is called a 
“table”? 


602 


Asked “Did you recognize your desk when you entered your room this 


morning?”—I should no doubt say “Certainly 1” And yet it would be 
misleading to say that an act of recognition had taken place. Of course the 
desk was not strange to me; I was not surprised to see it, as I should have 
been if another one had been standing there, or some unfamiliar kind of 
object. 


603 


To one will say that every time I enter my room, my long- familiar 
surroundings, there is enacted a recognition of all that I see and have seen 
hundreds of times before. 


604 


It is easy to have a false picture of the processes called “recognizing”; as if 
recognizing always consisted in co mparing two impressions with one 
another. It is as if I carried a picture of an object with me and used it to 
perform an identification of an object as the one represented by the picture. 
Our memory seems to us to be the agent of such a comparison, by preserving 
a picture of what has been seen before, or by allowing us to look into the 
past (as if down a spy-glass). 


605 


And it is not so much as if I were comparing the object with a picture set 
beside it, but as if the object coincided with the picture. To I see only one 
thing, not two. 


606 


We say “The expression in his voice was genuine”. Of it was spurious we 
think as it were of another one behind it .—This is the face he shews the 
world, inwardly he has another one.—But this does not mean that when his 
expression is genuine he has two the same. 


((“A quite particular expression.”)) 


607 


How does one judge what time it is? I do not mean by external evidences, 
however, such as the position of the sun, the lightness of the room, and so 


on.—One asks oneself, say, “What timp can it be?”, pauses a moment, 
perhaps imagines a clock-face, and then says a time.—Or one considers 
various possibilities, thinks first of one time, then of another, and in the end 
stops at one. That is the kind of way it is done.-But isn’t the idea 
accompanied by a feeling of conviction; and doesn’t that mean that it accords 
with an inner clock?—No, I don’t read the time off from any clock; there is a 
feeling of conviction inasmuch as I say a time to myself without feeling any 
doubt, with calm assurance.—But doesn’t something click as I say this time? 
—Not that I know of; unless that is what you call the coming- to-rest of 
deliberation, the stopping at one number. For should I ever have spoken of a 
feeling of conviction* here, but should have said: I considered a while and 
then plumped for its being quarter past five.-— But what did I go by? I might 
perhaps have said: “simply by feel”, 


which only means that I left it to what should suggest itself.- 


But you surely must at least have disposed yourself in a definite way in order 
to guess the time; and you don’t take just any idea of a time of day as 
yielding the correct time I—To repeat: I asked myself “I wonder what time it 
is?” That is, I did not, for example, read this question in some narrative, or 
quote it as someone else’s utterance; nor was I practising the pronunciation 
of these words; and so on. These were not the circumstances of my saying the 
words.—But then, what were the circumstances?—I was thinking about my 
breakfast and wondering whether it would be late today. These were the kind 
of circumstances.—But do you really not see that you were all the same 
disposed in a way which, though impalpable, is characteristic of guess ing 
the time, like being surrounded by a characteristic atmosphere?— Yes; what 
was characteristic was that I said to myself “I wonder what time it is?”—And 
if this sentence has a particular atmosphere, how am I to separate it from the 
sentence itself? It would never have occurred to me to think the sentence had 
such an aura if I had not thought of how one might say it differently—as a 
quotation, as a joke, as practice in elocution, and so on. And then all at once 
I wanted to say, then all at once it seemed to me, that I must after all have 
meant the words somehow specially; differently, that is, from in those other 
cases. The picture of the special atmosphere forced itself upon me; I can see 
it quite clear before me—so long, that is, as I do not look at what my 
memory tells me really happened. 


And as for the feeling of certainty: I sometimes say to myself “I am sure it’s . . 
. o'clock”, and in a more or less confident tone of voice, and so on. Of you 
ask me the reason for this certainty I have none. 


Of I say, I read it off from an inner clock,—that is a picture, and the only 
thing that corresponds to it is that I said it was such-and-such a time. And the 


purpose of the picture is to assimilate this case to the other one. I am refusing 
to acknowledge two different cases here. 


608 


The idea of the intangibility of that mental state in estimating the time is of 
the greatest importance. Why is it intangible ? Isn’t it because we refuse to 
count what is tangible about our state as part of the specific state which we 
are postulating? 


609 


The description of ah atmosphere is a special application of language, for 
special purposes. 


(interpreting ‘understanding’ as atmosphere; as a mental act. One can 
construct an atmosphere to attach to anything. ‘An indescribable character.’)) 


610 


Describe the aroma of coffee.—Why can’t it be done? To we lack the words? 
And for what are words lacking?—But how do we get the idea that such a 
description must after all be possible? Have you ever felt the lack of such a 
description? Have you tried to describe the aroma and not succeeded? 


(Cl should like to say: “These notes say something glorious, but I do not know 
what.” These notes are a powerful gesture, but I cannot put anything side by 
side with it that will serve as an explanation. A grave nod. James: “Our 
vocabulary is inadequate.” When why don’t we introduce a new one? That 
would have to be the case for us to be able to?)) 


611 


“Willing too is merely an experience,” one would like to say (the ‘will’ too 
only ‘idea’). It comes when it comes, and I cannot bring it about. 


Not bring it about?—Like what ? That can I bring about, then? That am I 
comparing willing with when I say this? 


612 


I should not say of the movement of my arm, for example: it comes when it 
comes, etc.. And this is the region in which we say significantly that a thing 
doesn’t simply happen to us, but that we do it. “I don’t need to wait for my 
arm to go up—I can raise it.” And here I am making a contrast between the 
movement of my arm and, say, the fact that the violent thudding of my heart 
will subside. 


61 j. In the sense in which I can ever bring anything about (such as stomach- 
ache through over-eating), I can also bring about an act of willing. In this 
sense I bring about the act of willing to s wim by jumping into the water. 
Doubtless I was trying to say: I can’t will willing; that is, it makes no sense to 
speak of willing willing. ” Willin g” is not the name of an action; and so not 
the name of any voluntary action either. And my use of a wrong expression 
came from our wanting to think of willing as an immediate non-causal 
bringing- about. A misleading analogy lies at the root of this idea; the causal 


nexus seems to be established by a mechanism connecting two parts of a 
machine. The connexion may be broken if the mechanism is dis turbed. (We 
think only of the disturbances to which a mechanism is normally subject, not, 
say, of cog-wheels suddenly going soft, or passing through one another, and 
so on.) 


614 


When I raise my arm ‘voluntarily’ I do not use any instru ment to bring the 
movement about. By wish is not such an instrument either. 


615 


“Willing, if it is not to be a sort of wishing, must be the action itself. It cannot 
be allowed to stop anywhere short of the action.” Of it is the action, then it is 
so in the ordinary sense of the word; so it is speaking, writing, walking, 
lifting a thing, imagining some thing. But it is also trying, attempting, making 
an effort,—to speak, to write, to lift a thing, to imagine something etc.. 


616 


When I raise my arm, I have not wished it might go up. The voluntary action 
excludes this wish. It is indeed possible to say: “I hope I shall draw the circle 
faultlessly”. And that is to express a wish that one’s hand should move in 
such-and-such a way. 


617 


Of we cross our fingers in a certain special way we are some times unable to 
move a particular finger when someone tells us to do so, if he only points to 
the finger—merely shews it to the eye. Of on the other hand he touches it, 
we can move it. One would like to describe this experience as follows: we are 
unable to will to move the finger. The case is quite different from that in 
which we are not able to move the finger because someone is, say, holding it. 
One now feels inclined to describe the former case by saying: one can’t find 
any point of application for the will till the finger is touched. Only when one 
feels the finger can the will know where it is to catch hold.—But this kind of 
expression is misleading. One would like to say: “How am I to know where I 
am to catch hold with the will, if feeling does not shew the place?” But then 
how is it known to what point I am to direct the will when the feeling is 
there? 


That in this case the finger is as it were paralysed until we feel a touch on it 
is shewn by experience; it could not have been seen a priori . 


618 


One imagines the willing subject here as something without any mass 
(without any inertia); as a motor which has no inertia in itself to overcome. 
And so it is only mover, not moved. That is: 


One can say “I will, but my body does not obey me”—but not: “My will does 
not obey me.” (Augustine. ) 


But in the sense in which I cannot fail to will, I cannot try to will either. 


619 


And one might say: “I can always will only inasmuch as I can never try to 
will.” 


620 


Going itself seems not to have any volume of experience. It seems like an 
extensionless point, the point of a needle. This point seems to be the real 
agent. And the phenomenal happenings only to be consequences of this 
acting. “I do. ..” seems to have a definite sense, separate from all experience. 


621 


Let us not forget this: when ‘I raise my arm’, my arm goes up. And the 
problem arises: what is left over if I subtract the fact that my arm goes up 
from the fact that I raise my arm? 


((Are the kinaesthetic sensations my willing?)) 


622 


When I raise my arm I do not usually try to raise it. 


623 


“At all costs I will get to that house.”—But if there is no difficulty about it— 
can I try at all costs to get to the house? 


624 


In the laboratory, when subjected to an electric current, for example, 
someone says with his eyes shut “I am moving my arm up and down”— 
though his arm is not moving. “So,” we say, “he has the special feeling of 
making that movement.”—Move your atm to and fro with your eyes shut. 
And now try, while you do so, to tell yourself that your arm is staying still 
and that you are only having certain queer feelings in your muscles and 
joints! 


625 


“How do you know that you have raised your arm?”—“I feel it.” To what you 
recognize is the feeling? And are you certain that you recognize it right?— 
You are certain that you have raised your arm; isn’t this the criterion, the - 
measure, of the recognition? 


62 6. “When I touch this object with a stick I have the sensation of touching 
in the tip of the stick, not in the hand that holds it.” When someone says 
“The pain isn’t here in my hand, but in my wrist”, this has the consequence 
that the doctor examines the wrist. But what difference does it make if I say 
that I feel the hardness of the object in the tip of the stick or in my hand? 
Does what I say mean “It is as if I had nerve-endings in the tip of the stick?” 
In what sense is it like that?—Well, I am at any rate inclined to say “I feel the 


hardness etc. in the tip of the stick.” That goes with this is that when I touch 
the object I look not at my hand but at the tip of the stick; that I describe 
what I feel by saying “I feel something hard and round there” _not “I feel a 
pressure against the tips of my thumb, middle finger, and index finger. . . .” 
If, for example, someone asks me “What are you now feeling in the fingers 
that hold the probe?” I 


might reply: “I don’t know-1 feel something hard and rough over there.” 


627 


Examine the following description of a voluntary action: “I form the decision 
to pull the bell at 5 o’clock, and when it strikes 5, my arm makes this 
movement.”—Is that the correct description, and not this one: “.and when it 
strikes 5, I raise my arm”?-One would like to supplement the first 
description: “and seel my arm goes up when it strikes 5.” And this “and seel” 
is precisely what doesn’t belong here. I do not say “See, my arm is going upl” 
when I raise it. 


628 


To one might say: voluntary movement is marked by the absence of surprise. 
And now I do not mean you to ask “But why isn’t one surprised here?” 


629 


When people talk about the possibility of foreknowledge of the future they 
always forget the fact of the prediction of one’s own voluntary movements. 


630 


Examine these two language-games: 


1. Someone gives someone else the order to make particular movements 
with his arm, or to assume particular bodily positions (gymnastics 
instructor and pupil). And here is a variation of this language-game: the 
pupil gives himself orders and then carries them out. 


2. Someone observes certain regular processes—for example, the reactions 
of different metals to acids—and thereupon makes predictions about the 
reactions that will occur in certain particular cases. 


There is an evident kinship between these two language-games, and also a 
fundamental difference. In both one might call the spoken words 
“predictions”. But compare the training, which leads to the first technique 
with the training for the second one. 


631 


“T am going to take two powders now, and in half-an-hour I shall be sick.”— 
It explains nothing to say that in the first case I am the agent, in the second 
merely the observer. Or that in the first case I see the causal connexion from 
inside, in the second from outside. And much else to the same effect. 


For is it to the point to say that a prediction of the first kind is no more 
infallible than one of the second kind. 


It was not on the ground of observations of my behaviour that I said I was 
going to take two powders. The antecedents of this proposi tion were 
different. I mean the thoughts, actions and so on which led up to it. And it 
can only mislead you to say: “The only essential presupposition of your 
utterance was just your decision.” 


632 


I do not want to say that in the case of the expression of intention “I am 
going to take two powders” the prediction is a cause— and its fulfilment the 
effect. (Perhaps a physiological investigation could determine this.) To much, 
however, is true: we can often predict a man’s actions from his expression of 
a decision. In important language-game. 


633 


“You were interrupted a while ago; do you still know what you were going to 
say?”—If I do know now, and say it—does that mean that I had already 
thought it before, only not said it? No. Unless you take the certainty with 
which I continue the interrupted sentence as a criterion of the thought’s 
already having been completed at that time.—But, of course, the situation 
and the thoughts which I had contained all sorts of things to help the 
continuation of the sentence. 


634 


When I continue the interrupted sentence and say that this was how I had 


been going to continue it, this is like following out a line of thought from 
brief notes. 


When don’t I interpret the notes? As only one continuation possible in these 
circumstances? Of course not. But I did not choose between interpretations. I 
remembered that I was going to say this. 


635 


“T was going to say.”—-You remember various details. 


But not even all of them together shew your intention. It is as if a snapshot of 
a scene had been taken, but only a few scattered details of it were to be seen: 
here a hand, there a bit of a face, or a hat—the rest is dark. And now it is as 
if we knew quite certainly what the whole picture represented. Is if I could 
read the darkness. 


636 


These ‘details’ are not irrelevant in the sense in which other circumstances 
which I can remember equally well are irrelevant. But if I tell someone “For a 
moment I was going to say ....” he does not learn those details from this, nor 
need he guess them. We need not know, for instance, that I had already 
opened my mouth to speak. But he can ‘fill out the picture’ in this way. (And 
this capacity is part of understanding what I tell him.) 


637 


“T know exactly what I was going to say!” And yet I did not say it—And yet I 
don’t read it off from some other process which took place then and which I 
remember. 


For am I interpreting that situation and its antecedents. For I don’t consider 
them and don’t judge them. 


638 


How does it come about that in spite of this I am inclined to see an 
interpretation in saying “For a moment I was going to deceive him”? 


“How can you be certain that for the space of a moment you were going to 
deceive him? Weren’t your actions and thoughts much too rudimentary?” 


For can’t the evidence be too scanty? Yes, when one follows it up it seems 

extraordinarily scanty; but isn’t this because one is taking no account of the 
history of this evidence? Certain antecedents were necessary for me to have 
had a momentary intention of pretending to someone else that I was unwell. 


Of someone says “For a moment.” is he really only describing a momentary 
process? 


But not even the whole story was my evidence for saying “For a moment.” 


639 


One would like to say that an opinion develops . But there is a mistake in this 
too. 


640 


“This thought ties on to thoughts which I have had before.”— How does it do 
so? Through a feeling of such a tie? But how can a feeling really tie thoughts 
together?—The word “feeling” is very misleading here. But it is sometimes 
possible to say with certainty: “This thought is connected with those earlier 
thoughts”, and yet be unable to shew the connexion. Perhaps that comes 
later. 


641 


“My intention was no less certain as it was than it would have been if I had 
said ‘Now I'll deceive him’.”—But if you had said the words, would you 
necessarily have meant them quite seriously? (Thus 


the most explicit expression of intention is by itself insufficient evidence of 
intention.) 


642 


“At that moment I hated him.”—-What happened here? Didn’t it consist in 
thoughts, feelings, and actions? And if I were to rehearse that moment to 
myself I should assume a particular expres sion, think of certain happenings, 
breathe in a particular way, arouse certain feelings in myself. I might think 
up a conversation, a whole scene in which that hatred flared up. And I might 
play this scene through with feelings approximating to those of a real 
occasion. That I have actually experienced something of the sort will 


naturally help me to do so. 


643 


Of I now become ashamed of this incident, I am ashamed of the whole thing: 
of the words, of the poisonous tone, etc.. 


644 


“I am not ashamed of what I did then, but of the intention which I had.”— 
And didn’t the intention lie also in what I did? That justifies the shame? The 
whole history of the incident. 


645 


“For a moment I meant to... .” That is, I had a particular feeling, an inner 
experience; and I remember it.-And now remem 


ber quite precisely 1 When the ‘inner experience’ of intending seems to 
vanish again. Instead one remembers thoughts, feelings, movements, and also 
connexions with earlier situations. 


It is as if one had altered the adjustment of a microscope. One did not see 
before what is now in focus. 


646 


“Well, that only shews that you have adjusted your micro scope wrong. You 
were supposed to look at a particular section of the culture, and you are 
seeing a different one.” 


There is something right about that. But suppose that (with a particular 
adjustment of the lenses) I did remember a single sensation; how have I the 
right to say that it is what I call the “intention”? It might be that (for 
example) a particular tickle accompanied every one of my intentions. 


647 


That is the natural expression of an intention?—Look at a cat when it stalks a 
bird; or a beast when it wants to escape. 


((Connexion with propositions about sensations.)) 


648 


“T no longer remember the words I used, but I remember my intention 
precisely; I meant my words to quiet him.” That does my memory shew me; 
what does it bring before my min d? Suppose it did nothing but suggest those 
words to me!—and perhaps others which fill out the picture still more 
exactly.—(“I don’t remember my words any more, but I certainly remember 
their spirit.”) 


649 


“So if a man has not learned a language, is he unable to have certain 
memories?” Of course—he cannot have verbal memories, verbal wishes or 
fears, and so on. And memories etc., in language, are not mere threadbare 
representations of the real experiences; for is what is linguistic not an 
experience? 


650 


We say a dog is afraid his master will beat him; but not, he is afraid his 
master will beat him to-morrow. Why not? 


651 


“T remember that I should have been glad then to stay still longer.” —-What 
picture of this wish came before my mind? One at all. That I see in my 
memory allows no conclusion as to my feelings. And yet I remember quite 
clearly that they were there. 


652 


“He measured him with a hostile glance and said .. . .” The reader of the 
narrative understands this; he has no doubt in his mind. How you say: “Very 
well, he supplies the meaning, he guesses it.”—-Generally speaking: no. 
Generally speaking he supplies nothing, guesses nothing.—But it is also 
possible that the hostile glance and the words later prove to have been 
pretence, or that the reader is kept in doubt whether they are so or not, and 
so that he really does guess at a possible interpretation.—But then the main 
thing he guesses at is a context. We says to himself for example: The two men 


who are here so hostile to one another are in reality friends, etc. etc. 


((“If you want to understand a sentence, you have to imagine the psychical 
significance, the states of mind involved.”)) 


65}. Imagine this case: I tell someone that I walked a certain route, going by 
a map which I had prepared beforehand. Thereupon I shew him the map, and 
it consists of lines on a piece of paper; but I cannot explain how these lines 
are the map of my movements, I cannot tell him any rule for interpreting the 
map. Let I did follow the drawing with all the characteristic tokens of reading 
a map. I might call such a drawing a ‘private’ map; or the phenomenon that I 
have described “following a private map”. (But this expression would, of 
course, be very easy to misunderstand.) 


Would I now say: “I read off my having then meant to do such-and- 


such, as if from a map, although there is no map”? But that means nothing 
but: I am now inclined to say “I read the intention of acting thus in certain 
states of mind which I remember.” 


654 


Our mistake is to look for an explanation where we ought to look at what 
happens as a c proto-phenomenon That is, where we ought to have said: this 
language-game is played . 


655 


The question is not one of explaining a language-game by means of our 
experiences, but of noting a language-game. 


656 


That is the purpose of telling someone that a time ago I had such-and-such a 
wish?—Look on the language-game as the primary thing. And look on the 
feelings, etc., as you look on a way of regarding the language-game, as 
interpretation. 


It might be asked: how did human beings ever come to make the verbal 
utterances which we call reports of past wishes or past intentions? 


657 


Let us imagine these utterances always taking this form: “I said to myself: ’if 
only I could stay longer A” The purpose of such a statement might be to 
acquaint someone with my reactions. (Compare the grammar of “mean” and 
“vouloir dire”.) 


658 


Suppose we expressed the fact that a man had an intention by saying “He as 
it were said to himself ’I will... .*”—That is the picture. And now I want to 
know: how does one employ the expres sion “as it were to say something to 
oneself”? For it does not mean: to say something to oneself. 


659 


Why do I want to tell him about an intention too, as well as telling him what 
I did?—Not because the intention was also something which was going on at 
that time. But because I want to tell him something about myself which goes 
beyond what happened at that time. 


I reveal to him something of myself when I tell him what I was going to do.— 
Not, however, on grounds of self-observation, but by way of a response (it 
might also be called an intuition). 


660 


The grammar of the expression “I was then going to say ....” is related to that 
of the expression “I could then have gone on.” 


In the one case I remember an intention, in the other I remember having 
understood. 


661 


I remember having meant him. Am I remembering a process or state? —-When 
did it begin, what was its course; etc.? 


662 


In an only slightly different situation, instead of silently beckoning, he would 
have said to someone “Tell N. to come to me.” One can now say that the 
words “I wanted N. to come to me” describe the state of my mind at that 


time; and again one may not say so. 


66 3. Of I say “I meant him” very likely a picture comes to my mind, perhaps 
of how I looked at him, etc.; but the picture is only like an illustration to a 
story. From it alone it would mostly be impossible to conclude anything at 
all; only when one knows the story does one know the significance of the 
picture. 


664 


In the use of words one might distinguish ‘surface grammar’ from ‘depth 
grammar’. That immediately impresses itself upon us about the use of a word 
is the way it is used in the construction of the sentence, the part of its use— 
one might say—that can be taken in by the ear.-And now compare the depth 
grammar, say of the word 


“to mean”, with what its surface grammar would lead us to suspect. To 
wonder we find it difficult to know our way about. 


665 


Imagine someone pointing to his cheek with an expression of pain and saying 
“abracadabra!”—We ask “What do you mean?” And he answers “I meant 
toothache”.—You at once think to yourself: How can one ‘mean toothache’ 
by that word? Or what did it mean to mean pain by that word? And yet, ina 
different context, you would have asserted that the mental activity of 
meaning such-and-such was just what was most important in using language. 


But—can’t I say “By ‘abracadabra’ I mean toothache”? Of course I can; but 
this is a definition; not a description of what goes on in me when I utter the 
word. 


666 


Imagine that you were in pain and were simultaneously hearing a nearby 
piano being tuned. You say “It’ll soon stop.” It certainly makes quite a 
difference whether you mean the pain or the piano-tuning 1 —Of course; but 
what does this difference consist in? I aHmit-j in many cases some direction 
of the attention will correspond to your meaning one thing or another, just as 
a look often does, or a gesture, or a way of shutting one’s eyes which might 
be called “looking into oneself”. 


667 


Imagine someone simulating pain, and then saying “It'll get better soon”. 
Can’t one say he means the pain? and yet he is not concentrating his 
attention on any pain.—And what about when I finally say “It’s stopped 
now”? 


668 


But can’t one also lie in this way: one says “It’ll stop soon”, 


and means pain—but when asked “What did you mean?” one answers “The 
noise in the next room”? In this sort of case one may say: “I was going to 
answer.... but thought better of it and did answer.” 


669 


One can refer to an object when speaking by pointing to it. Here pointing is a 
part of the language-game. And now it seems to us as if one spoke of a 
sensation by directing one’s attention to it. But where is the analogy? It 
evidently lies in the fact that one can point to a thing by looking or listening. 


But in certain circumstances, even pointing to the object one is talking about 
may be quite inessential to the language-game, to one’s thought. 


670 


Imagine that you were telephoning someone and you said to him: “This table 
is too tall”, and pointed to the table. That is the role of pointing here? Can I 
say: I mean the table in question by pointing to it? That is this pointing for, 
and what are these words and what ever else may accompany them for? 


671 


And what do I point to by the inner activity of listening? To the sound that 
comes to my ears, and to the silence when I hear nothing 


Listening as it were looks for an auditory impression and hence can’t point to 
it, but only to the place where it is looking for it. 


672 


Of a receptive attitude is called a kind of ‘pointing’ to some thing—then that 
something is not the sensation which we get by means of it. 


673 


The mental attitude doesn’t ’ accompany ’ what is said in the sense in which 
a gesture accompanies it. (As a man can travel alone, and yet be 
accompanied by my good wishes; or as a room can be empty, and yet full of 
light.) 


674 


Does one say, for example: “I didn’t really mean my pain just now; my mind 
wasn’t on it enough for that?” To I ask myself, say: “What did I mean by this 
word just now? By attention was divided between my pain and the noise—”? 


675 


“Tell me, what was going on in you when you uttered the words . . ..?”—-The 
answer to this is not: “I was meaning I 


676 


“T meant this by that word” is a statement which is differently used from one 
about an affection of the mind. 


677 


In the other hand: “When you were swearing just now, did you really mean 
it?” This is perhaps as much as to say: “Were you really angry?”—And the 
answer may be given as a result of intro spection and is often some such 
thing as: “I didn’t mean it very seriously”, “I meant it half jokingly” and so 
on. There are differences of degree here. 


And one does indeed also say “I was half thinking of him when I said that.” 


678 


That does this act of meaning (the pain, or the piano-tuning) consist in? To 
answer comes—for the answers which at first sight suggest themselves are of 


no use.—“And yet at the time I meant the one thing and not the other.” Yes, 
—now you have only repeated with emphasis something which no one has 
contradicted anyway. 


679 


“But can you doubt that you meant this?” —No; but neither can I be certain 
of it, know it. 


680 


When you tell me that you cursed and meant N. as you did so it is all one to 
me whether you looked at a picture of him, or imagined him, uttered his 
name, or what. The conclusions from this fact that interest me have nothing 
to do with these things. In the other hand, however, someone might explain 
to me that cursing was effective only when one had a clear image of the man 
or spoke his name out loud. But we should not say “The point is how the man 
who is cursing means his victim.” 


681 


Nor, of course, does one ask: “Are you sure that you cursed him, that the 
connexion with him was established?” 


When this connexion must be very easy to establish, if one can be so sure of 
it? I Can know that it doesn’t fail of its object I—Well, can it happen to me, 
to intend to write to one person and in fact write to another? and how might 
it happen? 


682 


“You said, Tt’ll stop soon’.—Were you thinking of the noise or of your pain?” 
Of he answers “I was thinking of the piano-tuning”— is he observing that the 
connexion existed, or is he making it by means of these words?—Can’t I say 
both} Of what he said was true, didn’t the connexion exist—and is he not for 
all that making one which did not exist? 


683 


I draw a head. You ask “Whom is that supposed to repre sent?”—I: “It’s 
supposed to be N.”—You: “But it doesn’t look like him; if anything, it’s rather 


like M.”—When I said it represented N.— was I establishing a connexion or 
reporting one? And what connexion did exist? 


684 


That is there in favour of saying that my words describe an existing 
connexion? Well, they relate to various things which didn’t simply make 
their appearance with the words. They say, for example, that I should have 
given a particular answer then, if I had been asked. And even if this is only 
conditional, still it does say something about the past. 


685 


“Look for A” does not mean “Look for B”; but I may do just the same thing in 
obeying the two orders. 


To say that something different must happen in the two cases would be like 
saying that the propositions “Today is my birthday” and “My birthday is on 
April 26th” must refer to different days, because they do not make the same 
sense. 


686 

“Of course I meant B; I didn’t think of A at alll” 

“T wanted A to come to me, so as to. . —All this points to a wider context. 
687 


Instead of “I meant him” one can, of course, sometimes say “I thought of 
him”; sometimes even “Yes, we were speaking of him.” Ask yourself what 
‘speaking of him’ consists in. 


688 


In certain circumstances one can say “As I was speaking, I felt I was saying it 
to you”. But I should not say this if I were in any case talking with you. 


689 


“T am thinking of N.” “I am speaking of N.” 


How do I speak of him? I say, for instance, “I must go and see A 
today”-But surely that is not enough! After all, when I say “N” 


I might mean various people of this name.—“Then there must surely be a 
further, different connexion between my talk and N, for otherwise I should 
still not have meant HIM. 


Certainly such a connexion exists. Only not as you imagine it: namely by 
means of a mental mechanism. 


(One compares “meaning him” with “aiming at him”.) ### 690 That about 
the case where I at one time make an apparently innocent remark and 
accompany it with a furtive sidelong glance at someone; and at another time, 
without any such glance, speak of somebody present openly, mentioning his 
name—am I really thinking specially about him as I use his name? 


691 


When I make myself a sketch of N’s face from memory, I can surely be said to 
mean him by my drawing. But which of the processes taking place while I 
draw (or before or afterwards) could I call meaning him? 


For one would naturally like to say: when he meant him, he aimed at him. 
But how is anyone doing that, when he calls someone else’s face to mind? 


I mean, how does he call HIM to mind? 


How does he call him ? 


692 


Is it correct for someone to say: “When I gave you this rule, 


I meant you to.in this case”? Even if he did not think of this case at all as he 
gave the rule? Of course it is correct. For “to mean it” did not mean: to think 
of it. But now the problem is: how are we to judge whether someone meant 
such-and-such?—The fact that he has, for example, mastered a particular 
technique in arithmetic and algebra, and that he taught someone else the 
expansion of a series in the usual way, is such a criterion. 


693 


“When I teach someone the formation of the series .... I surely mean him to 
write .... at the hundredth place.”—Quite right; you mean it. And evidently 
without necessarily even thinking of it. This shews you how different the 
grammar of the verb “to mean” is from that of “to think”. And nothing is 
more wrong-headed than calling meaning a mental activity 1 Unless, that is, 
one is setting out to produce confusion. (It would also be possible to speak of 
an activity of butter when it rises in price, and if no problems are produced 
by this it is harmless.)
