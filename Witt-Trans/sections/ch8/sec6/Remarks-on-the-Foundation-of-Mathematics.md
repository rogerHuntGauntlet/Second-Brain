143-156. Foundation of a calculating procedure and of a logical inference.--Calculating
without propositions (143-145). Example: sale of timber (143-152). "Are our laws of
inference eternal and unalterable"? (155). Logic precedes truth (156). 92
Page 6
157-170. Mathematics, logic and experience.--Proof and experiment (157-169). What
about mathematics is logic: it moves in the rules of our language (165). The
mathematician is an inventor, not a discoverer (168). The grounds of the logical must
(169-171). 96

Appendix I
Page 6
1-7. Two sorts of negation. One cancels out when repeated, the other is still a negation.
How we mean the one or the other sort in double negation. Meaning tested by the
expression of meaning (3). Negation compared with rotation through 180° in geometry
(1, 6, 7). 102
Page 6
8-10. We can imagine a 'more primitive' logic, in which only sentences containing no
negation can be negated (8). The question whether negation has the same meaning for
these people as for us (9). Does the figure one mean the same both times in "This rod is
1 metre long" and "Here is 1 soldier" (10)? 105


Page Break 7
Page 7
12-13. Two systems for measuring length. 1 foot = 1W, but 2W = 4 foot, etc. Do "W"
and "foot" mean the same? 106
Page 7
16. Meaning as the function of a word in a sentence. 107
Page 7
17-27. Use of the word "is" as copula and as sign of identity. The personal union by the
same word a mere accident. Essential and inessential features of a notation.
Comparison with the role of a piece in a game. A game does not just have rules, it has a
point (20). 108

Appendix II
Page 7
1-13. The surprising may play completely different roles in mathematics in two
different ways.--A state of affairs may appear astonishing because of the kind of way it
is represented. Or the emergence of a particular result may be seen as in itself
surprising. The second kind of surprise not legitimate. Criticism of the conception that
mathematical demonstration brings something hidden to light (2). "No mystery here"
means: Look around (4). A calculation compared with a way of turning up a card (5).
When we don't command a view over what we have been doing, it strikes us as

                                            3
mysterious. We adopt a particular form of expression and become dominated by it in
acting and thinking (8). 111

Appendix III
Page 7
1-4. Kinds of proposition.--Arithmetic done without propositions (4). 116
Page 7
5-7. Truth and provability in the system of Principia Mathematica. 117

Page Break 8
in the system of Principia Mathematica.--The role of contradiction in the
language-game (11-14, 17).
118
Page 8
20. The propositions of logic. 'Proposition' and 'proposition-like formation'.
123

PART II
Page 8
1-22. ("Additions").--The diagonal procedure. What use can be made of the diagonal
number? (3) "The motto here is: Take a wider look round" (6). We should regard with
suspicion the result of a calculation expressed in words (7). The concept
'nondenumerable' (10-13). Comparison of the concepts 'real number' and 'cardinal
number' from the point of view of serial ordering (16-22). 125
Page 8
23. The sickness of a time. 132
Page 8
24-27. Discussion of the proposition "There is no greatest cardinal number." "We say of
a licence that it does not terminate" (26). 133
Page 8
28-34. Irrational numbers. There is no system of irrational numbers (33). But Cantor
defines a higher order difference, namely a difference between a development and a
system of developments (34).

                                            4
35-39. 0. From our having a use for a kind of numeral that gives the number of terms
of an infinite series it doesn't follow that it also makes any sense to talk about the
number of the concept 'infinite series'. There is no grammatical technique suggesting
the use of such an expression. Such a use is not still to be discovered, but takes
inventing (38). 135
Page 8
40-48. Discussion of the proposition "Fractions cannot be arranged in a series in order
of magnitude."
137


Page Break 9
Page 9
49-50. How do we compare games? 139
Page 9
51-57. Discussion of the proposition that fractions (number-pairs) can be ordered in an
infinite series.
139
Page 9
58-60. "Is the word 'infinite' to be avoided in mathematics?" 141
Page 9
61. Finitism and Behaviourism are similar trends. Both deny the existence of something
with a view to getting out of a muddle. 142
Page 9
62. "What I am doing is not showing up calculations as wrong, but subjecting the
interest of calculations to test."
142
PART III
Page 9
1-2. Proof.--Mathematical proof must be perspicuous. Role of definitions (2). 143
Page 9
3-8. Russell's logic and the idea of the reduction of arithmetic to symbolic logic.--The
application of the calculation must take care of itself (4). Proof in the Russellian
calculus, in the decimal calculus, and in the stroke calculus. 144
Page 9
9-11. Proof.--Proof as a memorable picture (9). The reproduction of the pattern of a
proof (10-11).

12-20. Russell's logic and the problem of the mutual relation of different calculating
techniques.--What is the invention of the decimal system? (12.) Proof in the Russellian
calculus and in the decimal system (13). Signs for numbers that can, and that cannot, be
taken in (16). Relation of abbreviated and unabbreviated calculating techniques to one
another (17-20). 151
Page 9
21-44. Proof.--Identity and reproducibility of a proof (21). The proof


Page Break 10
as model. Proof and experiment (22-24). Proof and mathematical conviction (25-26). In
the proof we have won through to a decision (27). The proved proposition as a rule. It
serves to shew us what it makes sense to say (28). The propositions of mathematics as
'instruments of language' (29). The mathematical must correspond to a track which I lay
down in language (30). The proof introduces a new concept (31). What concept does 'p
 p' produce? (32). 'p  p' as pivot of the linguistic method of representation (33).
The proof as part of an institution (36). Importance of the distinction between
determining and using a sense (37). Acceptance of a proof; the 'geometrical' conception
of proof (38-40). The proof as adoption of a particular employment of signs (41). "The
proof must be a procedure plain to view" (42). "Logic as foundation of mathematics
does not work if only because the cogency of the logical proof stands and falls with its
geometrical cogency" (43). In mathematics we can get away from logical proofs (44).
158
Page 10
45-64. Russell's logic.--Relation between the ordinary and the Russellian technique of
proof (45). Criticism of the conception of logic as the 'foundation' of mathematics.
Mathematics is a motley of calculating techniques. The abbreviated technique as a new
aspect of the unabbreviated (46-48). Remark on trigonometry (50). The decimal
notation is independent of calculation with unit strokes (51). Why Russell's logic does
not teach us to divide (52). Why mathematics is not logic (53). Recursive proof (54).
Proof and experiment (55). The correspondence of different calculi; stroke notation and
decimal notation (56-57). Several proofs of one and the same proposition; proof and the
sense of a mathematical proposition (58-62). The exact correspondence of a convincing
transition in music and in mathematics (63). 175
Page 10
65-76. Calculation and experiment.--Are the propositions of mathematics
anthropological propositions? (65). Mathematical propositions conceived as prophecies
of concordant results of calculating (66). Agreement is part of the phenomenon of


Page Break 11
calculating (67). If a calculation is an experiment, what in that case is a mistake in
calculation? (68). The calculation as an experiment and as a path (69). A proof
subserves mutual understanding. An experiment presupposes it (71). Mathematics and
the science of conditioned calculating reflexes (72). The concept of calculation
excludes confusion (75-76). 192


                                            6

77-90. Contradiction.--A game in which the one who moves first must always win (77).
Calculating with (a - a). The chasms in a calculus are not there if I do not see them
(78). Discussion of the heterological paradox (79). Contradiction regarded from the
point of view of the language-game. Contradiction as a 'hidden sickness' of the calculus
(80). Contradiction and the usability of a calculus (81). The consistency proof and the
misuse of the idea of mechanical insurance against contradiction (82-89). "My aim is to
change the attitude towards contradiction and the consistency proof." (82) The role of
the proposition: "I must have miscalculated"--the key to understanding the 'foundations'
of mathematics (90). 202

PART IV
Page 11
1-7. On axioms.--The self-evidence of axioms (1-3). Self-evidence and use (2-3).
Axiom and empirical proposition (4-5). The negation of an axiom (5). The
mathematical proposition stands on four legs, not on three (7). 223

8-9. Following a rule.--Description by means of a rule (8). 227
Page 11
10. The arithmetical assumption is not tied to experience. 229

Page 12
14. External relation of the logical (mathematical) proposition. 231
Page 12
15-19. The possibility of doing applied mathematics without pure
mathematics.--Mathematics need not be done in propositions; the centre of gravity may
lie in action (15). The commutative law as an example (16-17).

21. The picture as a proof. 235

                                            7
Page 12
26. What is the difference between not calculating and calculating wrong? 236
Page 12
29-33. Proof and mathematical concept formation.--Proof alters concept formation.
Concept formation as the limit of the empirical (29). Proof does not compel, but guides
(30). Proof conducts our experience into definite channels (31, 33). Proof and
prediction (33). 237
Page 12
34. The philosophical problem is: how can we tell the truth and at the same time pacify
these strong prejudices?
242
Page 12
35-36. The mathematical proposition.--We acknowledge it by turning our back on it
(35). The effect of the proof: one plunges into the new rule (36). 243
Page 12
39, 42. Synthetic character of mathematical propositions.--The distribution of primes as
an example (42).
245
Page 12
40. The result set up as equivalent to the operation. 245
Page 12
41. That proof must be perspicuous means that causality plays no part in proof. 246

43-44. Intuition in mathematics. 246

Page 13
50-51. Reversal of a word. 250
Page 13
52-53. Mathematical and empirical propositions.--The assumption of a mathematical
concept expresses the confident expectation of certain experiences; but the
establishment of this measure is not equivalent to the expression of the expectations
(53). 253
Page 13
55-60. Contradiction.--The liar (58). Contradiction conceived as something supra-
propositional, as a monument with a Janus head enthroned above the propositions of
logic (59). 254

PART V
Page 13
1-4. Mathematics as a game and as a machine-like activity.--Does the calculating
machine calculate? (2). How far is it necessary to have a concept of 'proposition' in
order to understand Russell's mathematical logic? (4).
257
Page 13
5-8. Is a misunderstanding about the possible application of mathematics any objection
to a calculation as part of mathematics?--Set theory (7). 259
Page 13
9-13. The law of excluded middle in mathematics.--Where there is nothing to base a
decision on, we must invent something in order to give the application of the law of
excluded middle a sense. 266

concepts whose application is not understood.--Infinite predictions (23). 272

17-20. The law of excluded middle. The mathematical proposition as a commandment.
Mathematical existence.
275
Page 14
24-27. Existence proofs in mathematics.--"The harmful invasion of mathematics by
logic" (24; see also 46 and 48). The mathematically general does not stand to the
mathematically particular in the same relation as does the general to the particular
elsewhere (25). Existence proofs which do not admit of the construction of what exists
(26-27). 281

                                            9

28. Proof by reductio ad absurdum. 285
Page 14
29-40. Extensional and intensional in mathematics; the Dedekind cut--geometrical
illustration of analysis (2q) [[sic, 9?]]. Dedekind's theorem without irrational numbers

is an unordered totality (38). Discussion of the mathematical concept of a function;
extension and intension in analysis (39-40). 285

non-necessary ones.
295
Page 14
42-46. On proof and understanding of a mathematical proposition.--The proof
conceived as a movement from one concept to another (42). Understanding a
mathematical proposition (45-46). The proof introduces a new concept. The proof
serves to convince one of something (45). Existence proof and construction (46).

Page Break 15
Page 15
48. 'Mathematical logic' has completely blinded the thinking of mathematicians and
philosophers.

50. On the concept of generality. 300
Page 15
51. The proof shews how the result is yielded. 301
Page 15
52-53. General remarks.--The philosopher is the man who has to cure himself of many
sicknesses of the understanding before he can reach the notions of the healthy human
understanding. 301

                                            10
PART VI
Page 15
1. Proofs give propositions an order. 303
Page 15
2. Only within a technique of transformation is a proof a formal test. The addition of
certain numbers is called a formal test of the numerals, but only because adding is a
practised technique. The proof also hangs together with the application. 303
Page 15
3. When the proposition in application does not seem to be right, the proof must shew
one why and how it must be right. 305
Page 15
4. The proof shews how, and thus why the rule--e.g., that 8  9 makes 72--can be used.
305
Page 15
5. The queer thing is that the picture, not the reality, is supposed to prove a proposition.
306
Page 15
6. The Euclidean proof teaches us a technique of finding a prime number between p
and p! And we become convinced that this technique must always lead to a prime
number > p. 307


Page Break 16
Page 16
7. The spectator sees the impressive procedure and judges "I realise that it must be like
that."--This "must" shews what kind of instruction he has drawn from the scene. 308
Page 16
8. This must shew that he has adopted a concept, i.e., a method; as opposed to the
application of the method.
309
Page 16
9. "Shew me how 3 and 2 make 5." Child and abacus.--One would ask someone "how?"
if one wanted to get him to shew that he understands what is in question here. 310
Page 16
10. "Shew me how..." in distinction from "Shew me that..." 312


                                             11
Page 16
11. The proof of a proposition doesn't mention the whole system of calculation behind
the proposition, which gives it sense. 313
Page 16
12. The domain of the tasks of philosophy. 314
Page 16
13. Ought we to say that mathematicians don't understand Fermat's last theorem? 314
Page 16
14. What would it be to "shew how there are infinitely many prime numbers"? 315
Page 16
15. The process of copying. The process of construction according to a rule. Must one
always have a clear idea whether his prediction is intended mathematically or
otherwise? 316
Page 16
16. The inexorable proposition is that by this rule this number follows after that one.
The result of the operation here turns into the criterion for this operation's having been
carried out. So we are able to judge in a new sense whether someone has followed the
rule. 318


Page Break 17
Page 17
17. The learning of a rule.--"It's supposed to keep on as I have shewn him."--What I
understand by 'uniform' I would explain by means of examples. 320
Page 17
18. Here definitions are no help to me. 321
Page 17
19. Paraphrasing the rule only makes it more intelligible to someone who can already
obey the paraphrase.
321
Page 17
20. Teaching someone to multiply: we reject different patterns of multiplication with
the same initial segment.
322
Page 17
21. It would be nonsense to say: just once in the history of the world, someone
followed a rule.--Disputes do not break out about whether a proceeding has been
according to a rule or not.--This belongs to the structure from which our language goes

                                              12
out to give a description, for example. 322
Page 17
22. As if we had hardened an empirical proposition into a rule and now experience is
compared with it and it is used to judge experience. 324
Page 17
23. In calculating everything depends on whether one calculates right or wrong.--The
arithmetical proposition is withdrawn from experiential checking. 324
Page 17
24. "If I follow the rule, then this is the only number I can get to from that one." That is
how I proceed; don't ask for a reason! 326
Page 17
25. Suppose someone were to work out the multiplication tables, log tables, etc.,
because he didn't trust them?--Does it make any difference whether we utter a sentence
of a calculus as a proposition of arithmetic or an empirical proposition? 327
Page 17
26. "According to the rule that I see in this sequence, this is how it continues." Not:
according to experience! Rather, that just is the sense of the rule. 327


Page Break 18
Page 18
27. When I see a rule in the series--can this consist in my seeing an algebraic
expression before me? Must it not belong to a language? 328
Page 18
28. The certainty with which I call the colour "red" is not to be called in question when
I give the description. For this characterises what we call describing.--Following
according to a rule is the bottom of our language-game. Because this (e.g., 252 = 625)
is the proceeding upon which we build all judging. 329
Page 18
29. Law, and the empirical proposition that we give this law.--"If I obey the order, I do
this!" does not mean: If I obey the order, I obey the order. So I must have a different
way of identifying the "this."
330
Page 18
30. If humans who have been educated in this fashion calculate like this anyway, then
what do we need the rule for? "252 = 625" does not mean that human beings calculate
like this, for 252  625 would not be the proposition that humans get not this but a
different result.


                                              13
"Apply the rule to those numbers."--If I want to follow it, have I any choice left? 332
Page 18
31. How far is it possible to describe the function of a rule?
If you aren't master of any rule, all I can do is train you.
But how can I explain the nature of the rule to myself? 333
Page 18
32. What surrounding is requisite for someone to be able to invent chess (e.g.)? Is
regularity possible without repetition? Not: how often must he have calculated right to
prove to others that he can calculate, but: how often, to prove it to himself? 334
Page 18
33. Can we imagine someone's knowing that he can calculate although he has never
done any calculating?
335


Page Break 19
Page 19
34. In order to describe the phenomenon of language, one has to describe a practice.
A country that exists for two minutes, and is a projection of part of England, with
everything that is going on in two minutes. Someone is doing the same as a
mathematician in England, who is calculating. In this two-minute-man calculating? 335
Page 19
35. How do I know that the name of this colour is "green"? If I asked other people and
they did not agree with me, I should become totally confused and take them or myself
for crazy. Here I react with this word ("green"); and that is also how I know how I have
to follow the rule now.
How a polygon of forces gets drawn according to the given arrows. 336
Page 19
36."The word OBEN has four sounds."--Is someone who counts the letters making an
experiment? It may be one.
Compare: (1) The word there has 7 sounds
(2) The sound-picture "Dædalus" has 7 sounds.
The second proposition is tenseless. The employment of the two propositions must be
different.
"By counting off the sounds one may obtain an empirical proposition--or again, a rule".

according to a rule presupposes some kind of uniformity. 347

EDITORS' PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION
Page 29
THE posthumously published writings of Wittgenstein which first appeared in 1956
with the title "Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics" almost all take their origin
from the period September 1937-April 1944. Wittgenstein did not return to this subject
matter in the last years of his life. On the other hand, he wrote a great deal on the
philosophy of mathematics and logic from 1929 to about 1934. A considerable part of
this--together with other material from these years--has been published under the titles
"Philosophische Bermerkungen" (1964) and "Philosophische Grammatik" (1969).
Page 29
The present revised edition of the "Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics"
contains the whole text of the first (1956) edition. In editing it we have thus left out
nothing that was already in print. On the other hand, we have included additional
material. Only Parts II and III of the first edition are here reprinted, practically
unaltered, as Parts III and IV.


                                             23
Page 29
We have taken the second Appendix to Part I of the first edition, enlarged by a few
additions from the MSS, and placed it as an independent Part II of this edition.
Page 29
Part VI of the present edition is entirely new. The MS includes perhaps the most
satisfactory presentation of Wittgenstein's thoughts on the problem of following a
rule--one of his most frequently recurring themes. The MS (164) was written in the
period 1941-1944; we have not been able to date it more precisely.†1 With the
exception of a few remarks at the end, which do not quite fit in with the circle of
problems that are otherwise the topic of the MS, it is here printed in extenso.
Page 29
Part I is the earliest of this collection and to a certain extent it has a peculiar position. It
is the only part that existed in typescript and is the most worked over of them all. The
typescript itself goes back to manuscripts which were composed for the most part in the
period from September 1937 to about the end of that year (117, 118, 119). But the
remarks on negation form an exception; they stem from a MS belonging to about the
turn of the year 1933-1934 (115).
Page 29
In its original form the typescript that is the basis for Part I formed



Page Break 30
the second half of an earlier version of "Philosophical Investigations". Wittgenstein
then split up this half of that version into clippings, supplied them with extensive
alterations and additions, and only then constructed that order of the individual remarks
that is reproduced here. In a notebook as late as 1944 he proposed a few alterations to
this typescript. (See p. 80, n.)
Page 30
The last section of the rearranged collection consisted of papers that had not been cut
up, though there were many manuscript additions, and it is not quite clear whether
Wittgenstein regarded them as belonging with the preceding text. This section deals
with the concept of negation, and as we have already mentioned, it was written 3-4
years earlier than the remainder of Part I. Its content occurs in great part in the
"Investigations" §§ 547-568. The editors left it out of the first edition, but have
included it here as Appendix I to Part I.
Page 30
The collection had two further appendices. They come from the same typescript as the
second half of the (earlier) "Investigations"; nevertheless they were separated from the
rest of the collection of clippings. The first deals with 'mathematical surprise'. The
second discusses among other things Gödel's theories of the existence of unprovable
but true propositions in the system of "Principia Mathematica." In the first edition we
included only the second appendix, but here both are published (Appendices II and III.)
Page 30


                                               24
With the exception of a few remarks which Wittgenstein himself had left out in the
arrangement of the clippings, what is here published as Part I comprises the whole
content of the second half of the early version of "Philosophical Investigations."
Page 30
It must have been Wittgenstein's intention also to attach appendices on Cantor's theory
of infinity and Russell's logic to the contributions on problems of the foundations of
mathematics that he planned to include in the "Philosophical Investigations." Under the
heading 'Additions' he wrote a certain amount on the problems connected with set
theory: about the diagonal procedure and the different kinds of number-concept. In the
time from April 1938 to January 1939 he wrote a MS book where, together with other
remarks on the philosophy of psychological concepts, he put in a good deal on
probability and truth (Gödel) and also on infinity and kinds of number (Cantor). These
writings he immediately continued in a notebook (162a and the beginning of 162b). In
the later war-years too he occasionally comes back to these topics. The confrontation
with Cantor was never brought to a terminus.


Page Break 31
Page 31
What is here published as Part II consists of the above-mentioned "Additions" in 117
and of a selection of remarks from 121. The whole presents an inconsiderable
expansion of Appendix II of Part I of the earlier (1956) edition. The arrangement of
sentences and paragraphs into numbered Remarks corresponds to the original text
(which was not wholly the case in the 1956 edition). The sections have been numbered
by the editors.
Page 31
Wittgenstein's confrontation with Russell, that is to say with the thought of the
derivability of mathematics from the calculi of logic, is found in Part III of this
collection (Part II of the edition of 1956). These writings stem from the period from
October 1939 to April 1940. The MS (122, continued in the second half of 117) was the
most extensive of all the MSS which form the basis of this collection. Neither in style
nor in content has it been perfected. The author keeps on renewing the attempt to
elucidate his thoughts on the nature of mathematical proof: what it means, for example,
to say that a proof must be surveyable; that it presents us with a new picture; that it
creates a new concept; and the like. His effort is to declare "the motley of mathematics"
and to make clear the connexion between the different techniques of calculation. In so
striving he simultaneously sets his face against the idea of a "foundation" of
mathematics, whether in the form of a Russellian calculus or in that of the Hilbertian
conception of a meta-mathematics. The idea of contradiction and of a consistency proof
is extensively discussed.
Page 31
The editors were of the opinion that this manuscript contained a wealth of valuable
thoughts as they are nowhere otherwise to be encountered in Wittgenstein's writings.
On the other hand it also seemed clear to them that this MS could not be published
unabridged. Thus a selection was requisite. The task was difficult, and the editors are
not entirely satisfied with the result.
Page 31
In the autumn of 1940 Wittgenstein began to occupy himself anew with the philosophy
of mathematics and wrote something about the question of following a rule. These

                                           25
writings (MS 123) are not published here. In May 1941 the work was taken up again
and soon led to investigations from which a considerable selection is published here as
Part VII.
Page 31
The first part of Part VII (§§ 1-23) was mostly written in June 1941. It discusses the
relation between mathematical and empirical propositions, between calculation and
experiment, treats the concept of contradiction and consistency anew and ends in the
neighbourhood of the


Page Break 32
Gödelian problem. The second half was written in the spring of 1944. It deals
principally with the concept of following a rule, of mathematical proof and logical
inference, and with the connexion between proof and concept formation in
mathematics. There are here numerous points of contact, on the one side with the
manuscripts of the intervening period (Parts IV and V) and with thoughts in the
"Philosophical Investigations" on the other. §§ 47-60 essentially form an earlier version
of what can now be found in the "Investigations" §§ 209 to 237. The sequence of the
remarks is different here; and some have not been taken up into the later version.--Both
halves of this Part VII were in the same MS book, which is one of the indications that
the author regarded them as belonging together.
Page 32
Part V is taken from two MSS (126 and 127) belonging to the years 1942 and
1943--while Part IV derives mainly from one MS (125) from the year 1942, with some
additions from the two MSS on which Part V is based. Much on these two parts has the
character of "preliminary studies" for the second half of Part VII; but they also contain
a wealth of material that the author did not use there.
Page 32
In Part V Wittgenstein discusses topics that connect up with Brouwer and Intuitionism:
the law of excluded middle and mathematical existence; the Dedekind cut and the
extensional and intensional way of looking at things in mathematics. In the second half
of this part there are remarks on the concept of generality in mathematics and
especially on a theme that makes its appearance still more strongly in Part VII: the role
of concept-formation and the relation between concept and truth in mathematics.
Page 32
The chronological arrangement of the material has the consequence that one and the
same theme is sometimes treated in different places. If Wittgenstein had put his
remarks together into a book, he would presumably have avoided many of these
repetitions.
Page 32
It must once more be emphasized: Part I and, practically speaking also Part VI, but only
these, are complete reproductions of texts of Wittgenstein's. Thus what is here
published as Parts II, III, IV, V and VII is a selection from extensive MSS. In their
preface to the first edition the editors conjectured that it might be desirable later to print
what they had omitted. They are still of the same opinion--but also of the opinion that
the time has not yet come to print the whole of Wittgenstein's MSS on these and other
topics.

The editors alone are responsible for the numbering of the selected paragraphs. (Even
in Part I.) But the articulation of the writing into


Page Break 33
"remarks"--here separated from one another by larger gaps--is Wittgenstein's own. With
a few exceptions we did not want to interfere with the order of the sections.
Nevertheless we have sometimes (especially at the end of Part IV and V) brought
together material belonging to the same subject matter from different places.
Page 33
The list of contents and the index are meant to help the reader to look over the whole
and to make it easier to look things up. We alone are responsible for the thematic
articulation of the material indicated in the list of contents.

Circa 1937-1938
Page 35
1. We use the expression: "The steps are determined by the formula...". How is it
used?--We may perhaps refer to the fact that people are brought by their education
(training) so to use the formula y = x2, that they all work out the same value for y when
they substitute the same number for x. Or we may say: "These people are so trained that
they all take the same step at the same point when they receive the order 'add 3'". We
might express this by saying: for these people the order "add 3" completely determines
every step from one number to the next. (In contrast with other people who do not
know what they are to do on receiving this order, or who react to it with perfect
certainty, but each one in a different way.)
Page 35
On the other hand we can contrast different kinds of formula, and the different kinds of
use (different kinds of training) appropriate to them. Then we call formulae of a
particular kind (with the appropriate methods of use) "formulae which determine a
number y for a given value of x", and formulae of another kind, ones which "do not
determine the number y for a given value of x". (y = x2 + 1 would be of the first kind, y
> x2 + 1, y = x2  1, y = x2 + z of the second.) The proposition "The formula...
determines a number y" will then be a statement about the form of the formulae--and
now we must distinguish such a proposition as "The formula which I have written
down determines y", or "Here is a formula which determines y", from one of the
following kind: "The formula, y = x2 determines the number y for a given value of x".
The question "Is the formula written down there one that determines y?" will then mean
the same as "Is what is there a formula of this kind or that?"--but it is not clear off-hand
what we are to make of the question "Is y = x2 a formula which determines y for a

                                             27
given value of x?" One might address this question to a pupil in order to test whether he
understands the use of the word "to


Page Break 36
determine"; or it might be a mathematical problem to work out whether there was only
one variable on the right-hand side of the formula, as e.g. in the case: y = (x2 + z)2 -
z(2x2 + z).
Page 36
2. "The way the formula is meant determines which steps are to be taken." What is the
criterion for the way the formula is meant? Presumably the way we always use it, the
way we were taught to use it.
We say, for instance, to someone who uses a sign unknown to us: "If by 'x!2' you mean
x2, then you get this value for y, if you mean      , that one".--Now ask yourself:
how does one mean the one thing or the other by "x!2"?
That will be how meaning it can determine the steps in advance.

3. How do I know that in working out the series + 2 I must write


          "20004, 20006"

and not
          "20004, 20008"?

--(The question: "How do I know that this colour is 'red'?" is similar.)
"But you surely know for example that you must always write the same sequence of
numbers in the units: 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 2, 4, etc."--Quite true: the problem must already
appear in this sequence, and even in this one: 2, 2, 2, 2, etc.--For how do I know that I
am to write "2" after the five hundredth "2"? i.e. that 'the same figure' in that place is
"2"? And if I know it in advance, what use is this knowledge to me later on? I mean:
how do I know what to do with this earlier knowledge when the step actually has to be
taken?
(If intuition is needed to continue the series + 1, then it is also needed to continue the
series + 0.)

"But do you mean to say that the expression '+ 2' leaves you in doubt what you are to
do e.g. after 2004?"--No; I answer "2006" without hesitation. But just for that reason it
is superfluous to suppose that this was determined earlier on. My having no doubt in
face of the question does not mean that it has been answered in advance.

"But I surely also know that whatever number I am given I shall be able, straight off
and with certainty, to give the next one.--Certainly my dying first is excluded, and a lot
of other things too. But my being so certain of being able to go on is naturally very
important.--
Page 37
4. "But then what does the peculiar inexorability of mathematics consist in?"--Would
not the inexorability with which two follows one and three two be a good
example?--But presumably this means: follows in the series of cardinal numbers; for in
a different series something different follows. And isn't this series just defined by this
sequence?--"Is that supposed to mean that it is equally correct whichever way a person
counts, and that anyone can count as he pleases?"--We should presumably not call it
"counting" if everyone said the numbers one after the other anyhow; but of course it is
not simply a question of a name. For what we call "counting" is an important part of
our life's activities. Counting and calculating are not--e.g.--simply a pastime. Counting
(and that means: counting like this) is a technique that is employed daily in the most
various operations of our lives. And that is why we learn to count as we do: with
endless practice, with merciless exactitude; that is why it is inexorably insisted that we
shall all say "two" after "one", "three" after "two" and so on.--But is this counting only
a use, then; isn't there also some truth corresponding to this sequence?" The truth is that
counting has proved to pay.--"Then do you want to say that 'being true' means: being
usable (or


Page Break 38
useful)?"--No, not that; but that it can't be said of the series of natural numbers--any
more than of our language--that it is true, but: that it is usable, and, above all, it is used.
Page 38
5. "But doesn't it follow with logical necessity that you get two when you add one to
one, and three when you add one to two? and isn't this inexorability the same as that of
logical inference?"--Yes! it is the same.--"But isn't there a truth corresponding to logical
inference? Isn't it true that this follows from that?"--The proposition: "It is true that this
follows from that" means simply: this follows from that. And how do we use this
proposition?--What would happen if we made a different inference--how should we get
into conflict with truth?
Page 38
How should we get into conflict with truth, if our footrules were made of very soft
rubber instead of wood and steel?--"Well, we shouldn't get to know the correct
measurement of the table."--You mean: we should not get, or could not be sure of
getting, that measurement which we get with our rigid rulers. So if you had measured
the table with the elastic rulers and said it measured five feet by our usual way of
measuring, you would be wrong; but if you say that it measured five feet by your way
of measuring, that is correct.--"But surely that isn't measuring at all!"--It is similar to
our measuring and capable, in certain circumstances, of fulfilling 'practical purposes'.
(A shopkeeper might use it to treat different customers differently.)
Page 38
If a ruler expanded to an extraordinary extent when slightly heated, we should say--in
normal circumstances--that that made it unusable. But we could think of a situation in'
which this was just what was wanted. I am imagining that we perceive the expansion
with the naked eye; and we ascribe the same numerical measure of length to bodies in
rooms of different temperatures, if they measure the same by the ruler which to the eye

                                              29
is now longer, now shorter.


Page Break 39
Page 39
It can be said: What is here called "measuring" and "length" and "equal length", is
something different from what we call those things. The use of these words is different
from ours; but it is akin to it; and we too use these words in a variety of ways.
Page 39
6. We must get clear what inferring really consists in: We shall perhaps say it consists
in the transition from one assertion to another. But does this mean that inferring is
something that takes place when we are making a transition from one assertion to
another, and so before the second one is uttered--or that inferring consists in making the
one assertion follow upon the other, that is, e.g., in uttering it after the other? Misled by
the special use of the verb "infer" we readily imagine that inferring is a peculiar
activity, a process in the medium of the understanding, as it were a brewing of the
vapour out of which the deduction arises. But let's look at what happens here.--There is
a transition from one proposition to another via other propositions, that is, a chain of
inferences; but we don't need to talk about this; for it presupposes another kind of
transition, namely that from one link of the chain to the next. Now a process of forming
the transition may occur between the links. There is nothing occult about this process; it
is a derivation of one sentence from another according to a rule; a comparison of both
with some paradigm or other, which represents the schema of the transition; or
something of the kind. This may go on on paper, orally, or 'in the head'.--The
conclusion may however also be drawn in such a way that the one proposition is uttered
after the other, without any such process; or the process may consist merely in our
saying "Therefore" or "It follows from this", or something of the kind. We call it a
"conclusion" when the inferred proposition can in fact be derived from the premise.


Page Break 40
Page 40
7. Now what does it mean to say that one proposition can be derived from another by
means of a rule? Can't anything be derived from anything by means of some rule--or
even according to any rule, with a suitable interpretation? What does it mean for me to
say e.g.: this number can be got by multiplying these two numbers? This is a rule
telling us that we must get this number if we multiply correctly; and we can obtain this
rule by multiplying the two numbers, or again in a different way (though any procedure
that leads to this result might be called 'multiplication'). Now I am said to have
multiplied when I have carried out the multiplication 265  463, and also when I say:
"twice four is eight", although here no calculating procedure led to the product (which,
however, I could also have worked out). And so we also say a conclusion is drawn,
where it is not calculated.
Page 40
8. But still, I must only infer what really follows!--Is this supposed to mean: only what
follows, going by the rules of inference; or is it supposed to mean: only what follows,
going by such rules of inference as somehow agree with some (sort of) reality? Here
what is before our minds in a vague way is that this reality is something very abstract,
very general, and very rigid. Logic is a kind of ultra-physics, the description of the


                                             30
'logical structure' of the world, which we perceive through a kind of ultra-experience
(with the understanding e.g.). Here perhaps inferences like the following come to mind:
"The stove is smoking, so the chimney is out of order again". (And that is how this
conclusion is drawn! Not like this: "The stove is smoking, and whenever the stove
smokes the chimney is out of order; and so...".)
Page 40
9. What we call 'logical inference' is a transformation of our expression. For example,
the translation of one measure into another. One edge of a ruler is marked in inches, the
other in centimetres. I


Page Break 41
measure the table in inches and go over to centimetres on the ruler.--And of course
there is such a thing as right and wrong in passing from one measure to the other; but
what is the reality that 'right' accords with here? Presumably a convention, or a use, and
perhaps our practical requirements.
Page 41
10. "But doesn't e.g. 'fa' have to follow from '(x).fx' if '(x).fx' is meant in the way we
mean it?"--And how does the way we mean it come out? Doesn't it come out in the
constant practice of its use? and perhaps further in certain gestures--and similar
things.--But it is as if there were also something attached to the word "all", when we
say it; something with which a different use could not be combined; namely, the
meaning. "'All' surely means: all!" we should like to say, when we have to explain this
meaning; and we make a particular gesture and face.
Page 41
Cut down all these trees!--But don't you understand what 'all' means? (He had left one
standing.) How did he learn what 'all' means? Presumably by practice.--And of course
this practice did not only bring it about that he does this on receiving the order--it
surrounded the word with a whole lot of pictures (visual and others) of which one or
another comes up when we hear and speak the word. (And if we are supposed to give
an account of what the 'meaning' of the word is, we first pull out one from this mass of
pictures--and then reject it again as non-essential when we see that now this, now that,
picture presents itself, and sometimes none at all.)
Page 41
One learns the meaning of "all" by learning that 'fa' follows from '(x).fx'.--The exercises
which drill us in the use of this word, which teach its meaning, always make it natural
to rule out any exception.
Page 41
11. For how do we learn to infer? Or don't we learn it?


Page Break 42
Page 42
Does a child know that an affirmative follows from a double negative?--And how does
one shew him that it does? Presumably by shewing him a process (a double inversion,

                                            31
two turns through 180° and similar things) which he then takes as a picture of negation.
Page 42
And the meaning of '(x).fx' is made clear by our insisting on 'fa''s following from it.
Page 42
12. "From 'all', if it is meant like this, this must surely follow!"--If it is meant like
what? Consider how you mean it. Here perhaps a further picture comes to your
mind--and that is all you have got.--No, it is not true that it must--but it does follow: we
perform this transition.
And we say: If this does not follow, then it simply wouldn't be all--and that only shews
how we react with words in such a situation.--
Page 42
13. It strikes us as if something else, something over and above the use of the word
"all", must have changed if 'fa' is no longer to follow from '(x).fx'; something attaching
to the word itself.
Isn't this like saying: "If this man were to act differently, his character would have to be
different". Now this may mean something in some cases and not in others. We say
"behaviour flows from character" and that is how use flows from meaning.
Page 42
14. This shews you--it might be said--how closely certain gestures, pictures, reactions,
are linked with a constantly practised use.
Page 42
'The picture forces itself on us....' It is very interesting that pictures do force themselves
on us. And if it were not so, how could


Page Break 43
such a sentence as "What's done cannot be undone" mean anything to us?
Page 43
15. It is important that in our language--our natural language--'all' is a fundamental
concept and 'all but one' less fundamental; i.e. there is not a single word for it, nor yet a
characteristic gesture.
Page 43
16. The point of the word "all" is that it admits no exception.--True, that is the point of
its use in our language; but the kinds of use we feel to be the 'point' are connected with
the role that such-and-such a use has in our whole life.
Page 43
17. When we ask what inferring consists in, we hear it said e.g.: "If I have recognized
the truth of the propositions..., then I am justified in further writing down...".--In what
sense justified? Had I no right to write that down before?--"Those propositions
convince me of the truth of this proposition." But of course that is not what is in

                                              32
question either.--"The mind carries out the special activity of logical inference
according to these laws." That is certainly interesting and important; but then, is it true?
Does the mind always infer according to these laws? And what does the special activity
of inferring consist in?--This is why it is necessary to look and see how we carry out
inferences in the practice of language; what kind of procedure in the language-game
inferring is.
For example: a regulation says "All who are taller than five foot six are to join the ...
section". A clerk reads out the men's names and heights. Another allots them to
such-and-such sections.--"N.N. five foot nine." "So N.N. to the ... section." That is
inference.


Page Break 44
Page 44
18. Now, what do we call 'inferences' in Russell or Euclid? Am I to say: the transitions
from one proposition to the next one in the proof? But where is the passage to be
found?--I say that in Russell one proposition follows from another if the one can be
derived from the other according to the position of both in a proof and the appended
signs--when we read the book. For reading this book is a game that has to be learnt.
Page 44
19. One is often in the dark about what following and inferring really consists in; what
kind of fact, and what kind of procedure, it is. The peculiar use of these verbs suggests
to us that following is the existence of a connexion between propositions, which
connexion we follow up when we infer. This comes out very instructively in Russell's
account (Principia Mathematica). That a proposition q follows from a proposition
p  q.p is here a fundamental law of logic:


            pq.p..   q†1

Now this, one says, justifies us in inferring q from pq.p. But what does
'inferring', the procedure that is now justified, consist in? Surely in this: that in some
language-game we utter, write down (etc.), the one proposition as an assertion after the
other; and how can the fundamental law justify me in this?
Page 44
20. Now Russell wants to say: "This is how I am going to infer, and it is right". So he
means to tell us how he means to infer: this is done by a rule of inference. How does it
run? That this proposition implies that one?--Presumably that in the proofs in this book
a proposition like this is to come after a proposition like this.--But it is supposed to be a
fundamental law of logic that it is



Page Break 45
correct to infer in this way!--Then the fundamental law would have to run: "It is correct
to infer ... from ..."; and this fundamental law should presumably be self-evident--in
which case the rule itself will self-evidently be correct, or justified. "But after all this

                                             33
rule deals with sentences in a book, and that isn't part of logic!"--Quite correct, the rule
is really only a piece of information that in this book only this transition from one
proposition to another will be used (as it were a piece of information in the index); for
the correctness of the transition must be evident where it is made; and the expression of
the 'fundamental law of logic' is then the sequence of propositions itself.
Page 45
21. In his fundamental law Russell seems to be saying of a proposition: "It already
follows--all I still have to do is, to infer it". Thus Frege somewhere says that the
straight line which connects any two points is really already there before we draw it;
and it is the same when we say that the transitions, say in the series + 2, have really
already been made before we make them orally or in writing--as it were tracing them.
Page 45
22. One might reply to someone who said this: Here you are using a picture. One can
determine the transitions which someone is to make in a series, by doing them for him
first. E.g. by writing down in another notation the series which he is to write, so that all
that remains for him to do is to translate it; or by actually writing it down very faint,
and he has to trace it. In the first case we can also say that we don't write down the
series that he has to write, and so that we do not ourselves make the transitions of that
series; but in the second case we shall certainly say that the series which he is to write
is already there. We should also say this if we dictate what he has to write down,
although then we are producing a series of sounds and he a series of


Page Break 46
written signs. It is at any rate a sure way of determining the transitions that someone
has to make, if we in some sense make them first.--If, therefore, we determine these
transitions in a quite different sense, namely, by subjecting our pupil to such a training
as e.g. children get in the multiplication tables and in multiplying, so that all who are so
trained do random multiplications (not previously done in the course of being taught) in
the same way and with results that agree--if, that is, the transitions which someone is to
make on the order 'add 2' are so determined by training that we can predict with
certainty how he will go, even when he has never up to now taken this step--then it may
be natural to us to use this as a picture of the situation: the steps are all already taken
and he is just writing them down.
Page 46
23. "But we surely infer this proposition from that because it actually follows! We
ascertain that it follows."--We ascertain that what is written here follows from what is
written there. And this proposition is being used temporally.
Page 46
24. Separate the feelings (gestures) of agreement, from what you do with the proof.
Page 46
25. But how about when I ascertain that this pattern of lines:



                (a)

                                             34
is like-numbered with this pattern of angles:


Page Break 47




                              (b)
(I have made the patterns memorable on purpose) by correlating them:




                                (c)
Page 47
Now what do I ascertain when I look at this figure? What I see is a star with threadlike
appendages.--
Page 47
26. But I can make use of the figure like this: five people stand arranged in a pentagon;
against the wall are wands, like the strokes in (a); I look at the figure (c) and say: "I can
give each of the people a wand".
I could regard figure (c) as a schematic picture of my giving the five men a wand each.
Page 47
27. For if I first draw some arbitrary polygon:




                                             35
Page Break 48
and then some arbitrary series of strokes
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
I can find out by correlating them whether I have as many angles in the top figure as
strokes in the bottom one. (I do not know how it would turn out.) And so I can also say
that by drawing projection-lines I have ascertained that there are as many strokes at the
top of figure (c) as the star beneath has points. (Temporally!) In this way of taking it the
figure is not like a mathematical proof (any more than it is a mathematical proof when I
divide a bag of apples among a group of people and find that each can have just one
apple).
I can however conceive figure (c) as a mathematical proof. Let us give names to the
shapes of the patterns (a) and (b): let (a) be called a "hand", H, and (b) a "pentacle", P. I
have proved that H has as many strokes as P has angles. And this proposition is once
more non-temporal.
Page 48
28. A proof--I might say--is a single pattern, at one end of which are written certain
sentences and at the other end a sentence (which we call the 'proved proposition'.)
To describe such a pattern we may say: in it the proposition... follows from.... This is
one way of describing a design, which might also be for example an ornament (a
wallpaper design). I can say, then, "In the proof on that blackboard the proposition p
follows from q and r", and that is simply a description of what can be seen there. But it
is not the mathematical proposition that p follows from q and r. That has a different
application. It says--as one might put it--that it makes sense to speak of a proof
(pattern) in which p follows from q and r. Just as one can say that the proposition
"white is lighter than black" asserts that it makes sense to speak of two objects, the
lighter one white and the other black, but not of two objects, the lighter one black and
the other white.


Page Break 49
Page 49
29. Let us imagine that we had given a paradigm of 'lighter' and 'darker' in the shape of
a white and a black patch, and now, so to speak, we use it to deduce that red is darker
than white.
Page 49
30. The proposition proved by (c) now serves as a new prescription for ascertaining
numerical equality: if one set of objects has been arranged in the form of a hand and
another as the angles of a pentacle, we say the two sets are equal in number.
Page 49
31. "But isn't that merely because we have already correlated H and P and seen that
they are the same in number?"--Yes, but if they were so in one case, how do I know that
they will be so again now?--"Why, because it is of the essence of H and P to be the
same in number."--But how can you have brought that out by correlating them? (I
thought the counting or correlation merely yielded the result that these two groups

                                             36
before me were--or were not--the same in number.)
--"But now, if he has an H of things and a P of things, and he actually correlates them,
it surely isn't possible for him to get any result but that they are the same in
number.--And that it is not possible can surely be seen from the proof."--But isn't it
possible? If, e.g., he--as someone else might say--omits to draw one of the correlating
lines. But I admit that in an enormous majority of cases he will always get the same
result, and, if he did not get it, would think something had put him out. And if it were
not like this the ground would be cut away from under the whole proof. For we decide
to use the proof-picture instead of correlating the groups; we do not correlate them, but
instead compare the groups with those of the proof (in which indeed two groups are
correlated with one another).


Page Break 50
Page 50
32. I might also say as a result of the proof: "From now on an H and a P are called 'the
same in number'".
Or: The proof doesn't explore the essence of the two figures, but it does express what I
am going to count as belonging to the essence of the figures from now on.--I deposit
what belongs to the essence among the paradigms of language.
The mathematician creates essences.
Page 50
33. When I say "This proposition follows from that one", that is to accept a rule. The
acceptance is based on the proof. That is to say, I find this chain (this figure) acceptable
as a proof.--"But could I do otherwise? Don't I have to find it acceptable?"--Why do
you say you have to? Because at the end of the proof you say e.g.: "Yes--I have to
accept this conclusion". But that is after all only the expression of your unconditional
acceptance.
I.e. (I believe): the words "I have to admit this" are used in two kinds of case: when we
have got a proof--and also with reference to the individual steps of the proof.
Page 50
34. And how does it come out that the proof compels me? Well, in the fact that once I
have got it I go ahead in such-and-such a way, and refuse any other path. All I should
further say as a final argument against someone who did not want to go that way, would
be: "Why, don't you see...!"--and that is no argument.
Page 50
35. "But, if you are right, how does it come about that all men (or at any rate all normal
men) accept these patterns as proofs of these propositions?"--It is true, there is
great--and interesting--agreement here.

36. Imagine you have a row of marbles, and you number them with Arabic numerals,

                                             37
which run from 1 to 100; then you make a big gap after every 10, and in each 10 a
rather smaller gap in the middle with 5 on either side: this makes the 10 stand out
clearly as 10; now you take the sets of 10 and put them one below another, and in the
middle of the column you make a bigger gap, so that you have five rows above and five
below; and now you number the rows from 1 to 10.--We have, so to speak, done drill
with the marbles. I can say that we have unfolded properties of the hundred
marbles.--But now imagine that this whole process, this experiment with the hundred
marbles, were filmed. What I now see on the screen is surely not an experiment, for the
picture of an experiment is not itself an experiment.--But I see the 'mathematically
essential' thing about the process in the projection too! For here there appear first a
hundred spots, and then they are arranged in tens, and so on and so on.
Thus I might say: the proof does not serve as an experiment; but it does serve as the
picture of an experiment.
Page 51
37. Put two apples on a bare table, see that no one comes near them and nothing shakes
the table; now put another two apples on the table; now count the apples that are there.
You have made an experiment; the result of the counting is probably 4. (We should
present the result like this: when, in such-and-such circumstances, one puts first 2
apples and then another 2 on a table, mostly none disappear and none get added.) And
analogous experiments can be carried out, with the same result, with all kinds of solid
bodies.--This is how our children learn sums; for one makes them put down three beans
and then another three beans and then count what is there. If the result at one time were
5, at another 7 (say because, as we should now say, one sometimes got added, and one
sometimes vanished of itself), then the first thing we said would be that beans were no
good for teaching


Page Break 52
sums. But if the same thing happened with sticks, fingers, lines and most other things,
that would be the end of all sums.
"But shouldn't we then still have 2 + 2 = 4?"--This sentence would have become
unusable.
Page 52

to see that 2 + 2 are 4."--Then I only need to look at the figure

39. What do I convince anyone of, if he has followed the film projection of the
experiment with the hundred marbles?
One might say, I convince him that it happened like that.--But this would not be a
mathematical conviction.--But can't I say: I impress a procedure on him? This
procedure is the regrouping of 100 things in 10 rows of 10. And this procedure can as a
matter of fact always be carried out again. And he can rightly be convinced of that.


Page Break 53
Page 53
40. And that is how the proof (25) impresses a procedure on us by drawing projection-
lines: the procedure of one-one correlation of the H and the P.--"But doesn't it also
convince me of the fact that this†1 correlation is possible?"--If that is supposed to
mean: you can always carry it out--, then that doesn't have to be true at all. But the
drawing of the projection-lines convinces us that there are as many lines above as
angles below; and it supplies us with a model to use in correlating such patterns.--"But
surely what the model shews in this way is that it does work, not that it did work this
time? In the sense in which it wouldn't have worked if the top figure had been ||||||

This figure too could be used to prove something. It could be used to shew that groups
of these forms cannot be given a 1-1 correlation.†2 'A 1-1 correlation is impossible
here' means, e.g., "these figures and 1-1 correlation don't fit together."
"I didn't mean it like that'"--Then shew me how you mean it, and I'll do it.
But can't I say that the figure shews how such a correlation is possible--and mustn't it
for that reason also shew that it is possible?--

41. Now what was the point of our proposal to attach names to the five parallel strokes
and the five-pointed star? What is done by their having got names? It will be a means
of indicating something about the kind of use these figures have. Namely--that we
recognize them as such-and-such at a glance. To do so, we don't count their strokes or
angles; for us they are typical shapes, like knife and fork, like letters and numerals.
Thus, when given the order "Draw an H" (for example)--I can produce this shape
immediately.--Now the proof teaches me a way of correlating the two shapes. (I should
like to say that it is not merely these individual figures that are correlated in the proof,
but the shapes themselves. But this surely only means that these shapes are well
impressed on my mind; are impressed as paradigms.) Now isn't it possible for me to get
into difficulties when I want to correlate the shapes H and P--say by there being an
angle too many at the bottom or a stroke too many at the top?--"But surely not, if you
have really drawn H and P again!--And that can be proved; look at this figure."

--This figure teaches me a new way of checking whether I have really drawn the same
figures; but can't I still get into difficulties when I now want to use this model as a

Page 55
42. There is a puzzle which consists in making a particular figure, e.g. a rectangle, out
of given pieces. The division of the figure is such that we find it difficult to discover the
right arrangement of the parts. Let it for example be this:



                                             41
Page 55
What do you discover when you succeed in arranging it?--You discover a position--of
which you did not think before.--Very well; but can't we also say: you find out that
these triangles can be arranged like this?--But 'these triangles': are they the actual ones
in the rectangle above, or are they triangles which have yet to be arranged like that?
Page 55
43. If you say: "I should never have thought that these shapes could be arranged like
that", we can't point to the solution of the puzzle and say: "Oh, you didn't think the
pieces could be arranged like that?"--You would reply: "I mean, I didn't think of this
way of arranging them at all".
Page 55
44. Let us imagine the physical properties of the parts of the puzzle to be such that they
can't come into the desired position. Not, however, that one feels a resistance if one
tries to put them in this


Page Break 56
position; but one simply tries everything else, only not this, and the pieces don't get into
this position by accident either. This position is as it were excluded from space. As if
there were e.g. a 'blind spot' in our brain here.--And isn't it like this when I believe I
have tried all possible arrangements and have always passed this one by, as if
bewitched?
Can't we say: the figure which shews you the solution removes a blindness, or again
changes your geometry? It as it were shews you a new dimension of space. (As if a fly
were shewn the way out of the fly-bottle.)
Page 56
45. A demon has cast a spell round this position and excluded it from our space.
Page 56
46. The new position has as it were come to be out of nothingness. Where there was
nothing, now there suddenly is something.
Page 56
47. In what sense has the solution shewn you that such-and-such can be done? Before,
you could not do it--and now perhaps you can.--


                                             42
Page 56
48. I said, "I accept such-and-such as proof of a proposition"--but is it possible for me
not to accept the figure shewing the arrangement of the pieces as proof that these pieces
can be arranged to have this periphery?


Page Break 57
Page 57
49. But now imagine that one of the pieces is lying so as to be the mirror-image of the
corresponding part of the pattern. Now you want to arrange the figure according to the
pattern; you see it must work, but you never hit on the idea of turning the piece over,
and you find that you do not succeed in fitting the puzzle together.
Page 57
50. A rectangle can be made of two parallelograms and two triangles. Proof:




A child would find it difficult to hit on the composition of a rectangle with these parts,
and would be surprised by the fact that two sides of the parallelograms make a straight
line, when the parallelograms are, after all, askew. It might strike him as if the rectangle
came out of these figures by something like magic. True, he has to admit that they do
form a rectangle, but it is by a trick, by a distorted arrangement, in an unnatural way.
I can imagine the child, after having put the two parallelograms together in this way,
not believing his eyes when he sees that they fit like that. 'They don't look as if they
fitted together like that.' And I could imagine its being said: It's only through some
hocus-pocus that it looks to us as if they yielded the rectangle--in reality they have
changed their nature, they aren't the parallelograms any more.
Page 57
51. "You admit this--then you must admit this too."--He must admit it--and all the time
it is possible that he does not admit it! You want to say: "if he thinks, he must admit it".

"I'll shew you why you have to admit it."--I shall bring a case before your eyes which

53. "Now you will admit that 5 consists of 3 and 2."




I will only admit it, if that is not to admit anything.--Except that I want to use this
picture.
Page 58
54. One might for example take this figure




as a proof of the fact that 100 parallelograms arranged like this must yield a straight
strip. Then, when one actually does put 100 together, one gets e.g. a slightly curved
strip.--But the proof has determined us to use this picture and form of expression: if
they don't yield a straight strip, they were not accurately constructed.


Page Break 59
Page 59
55. Just think, how can the picture (or procedure) that you shew me now oblige me
always to judge in such-and-such a way?
Page 59
If what we have here is an experiment, then surely one is too little to bind me to any
judgment.
Page 59
56. The one who is offering the proof says: "Look at this figure. What shall we say
about it? Surely that a rectangle consists of...?--"
Or again: "Now, surely you call this a 'parallelogram' and this a 'triangle', and this is
what it is like for one figure to consist of others".

57. "Yes, you have convinced me that a rectangle always consists of..."--Should I also
say: "Yes, you have convinced me that this rectangle (the one in the proof) consists
of..."? For wouldn't this be the more modest proposition, which you ought to grant even
if perhaps you don't yet grant the general proposition? But oddly enough if that is what
you grant, you seem to be granting, not the more modest geometrical proposition, but
what is not a proposition of geometry at all. Of course not--for as regards the rectangle
in the proof he didn't convince me of anything. (I shouldn't have been in any doubt
about this figure, if I had seen it previously.) As far as concerns this figure I
acknowledged everything of my own accord. And he merely used it to make me realize
something.--But on the other hand, if he didn't convince me of anything as regards this
rectangle, then how has he convinced me of a property of other rectangles?
Page 59
58. "True, this shape doesn't look as if it could consist of two skew parts."
What are you surprised at? Surely not at seeing this figure. It is something in the figure
that surprises me.--But there isn't anything going on in the figure!


Page Break 60
Page 60
What surprises me is the way straight and skew go together. It makes me as it were
dizzy.
Page 60
59. But I do actually say: "I have convinced myself that this figure can be constructed
with these pieces", e.g. I have seen a picture of the solution of the puzzle.
Now if I say this to somebody it is surely supposed to mean: "Just try: these bits,
properly arranged, really do yield the figure". I want to encourage him to do something
and I forecast that he will succeed. And the forecast is founded on the ease with which
we can construct the figure from the pieces as soon as we know how.
Page 60
60. You say you are astonished at what the proof shews you. But are you astonished at
its having been possible to draw these lines? No. You are only astonished when you tell
yourself that two bits like this yield this shape. When, that is, you think yourself into
the situation of seeing the result after having expected something different.
Page 60
61. "This follows inexorably from that."--True, in this demonstration this issues from
that.
This is a demonstration for whoever acknowledges it as a demonstration. If anyone
doesn't acknowledge it, doesn't go by it as a demonstration, then he has parted company
with us even before anything is said.

Here we have something thats looks inexorable--. And yet it can be 'inexorable' only in
its consequences! For otherwise it is nothing but a picture.
What does the action at a distance--as it might be called--of this pattern consist in?
Page 61
63. I have read a proof--and now I am convinced.--What if I straightway forgot this
conviction?
For it is a peculiar procedure: I go through the proof and then accept its result.--I mean:
this is simply what we do. This is use and custom among us, or a fact of our natural
history.
Page 61
64. 'If I have five, then I have three and two.'--But how do I know that I have
five?--Well, if it looks like this: |||||.--And is it also certain that when it looks like this, I
can always split it up into groups like those?
It is a fact that we can play the following game: I teach someone what a group of two,
three, four, or five, is like, and I teach him how to put strokes into one-to-one
correspondence; then I always make him carry out the order "Draw a group of five"
twice--and then I teach him to carry out the order: "Correlate these two groups"; and
here it proves that he practically always correlates the strokes without remainder.
Or again: it is a fact that I practically never get into difficulties in correlating what I
have drawn as groups of five.

65. I have to assemble the puzzle, I try it this way and that, am doubtful whether I shall
do it. Next someone shows me a picture of the solution, and I say without any sort of
doubt--"Now I can do it!"--Then am I certain to do it now?--The fact, however, is: I
don't have any doubt.
Suppose someone now asked: "What does the action at a distance of the picture consist
in?"--In the fact that I apply it.
Page 62
66. In a demonstration we get agreement with someone. If we do not, then we've parted
ways before ever starting to communicate in this language.

It is not essential that one should talk the other over by means of the demonstration.
Both might see it (read it), and accept it.
Page 62
67. "But you can see--there can't be any doubt, that a group like A consists essentially
of one like B and one like C."--I too say--i.e.




this is how I too express myself--that the group drawn there consists of the two smaller
ones; but I don't know whether every group which I should call the same in kind (or
form) as the first will necessarily be composed of two groups of the same kind as the
smaller ones.--But I believe that it will probably always be so (perhaps experience has
taught me this), and that is why I am willing to accept the rule: I will say that a group is
of the form A if and only if it can be split up into two groups like B and C.


Page Break 63
Page 63
68. And this too is how the drawing (50) works as a proof. "True enough! Two
parallelograms together do make this shape!" (That is very much as if I were to say:
"Actually, a curve can consist of straight bits.")--I shouldn't have thought it. Thought
what? That the parts of this figure yield this figure? No, not that. For that doesn't mean
anything.--My surprise is only when I think of myself unwittingly fitting the top
parallelogram on to the bottom one, and then seeing the result.
Page 63
69. And it could be said: What the proof made me realize--that's what can surprise me.
Page 63
70. For why do I say that the figure (50) makes me realize something any more than
this one:




                                             47
After all it too shews that two bits like that yield a rectangle. "But that isn't interesting",
we want to say. And why is it uninteresting?
Page 63
71. When one says: "This shape consists of these shapes"--one is thinking of the shape
as a fine drawing, a fine frame of this shape, on which, as it were, things which have
this shape are stretched. (Compare Plato's conception of properties as ingredients of a
thing.)


Page Break 64
Page 64
72. "This shape consists of these shapes. You have shewn the essential property of this
shape."--You have shewn me a new picture.
It is as if God had constructed them like that.--So we are employing a simile. The shape
becomes an ethereal entity which has this shape; it is as if it had been constructed like
this once for all (by whoever put the essential properties into things). For if the shape is
to be a thing consisting of parts, then the pattern-maker who made the shape is he who
also made light and dark, colour and hardness, etc. (Imagine someone asking: "The
shape... is made up of these parts; who made it? You?")
The word "being" has been used for a sublimed ethereal kind of existence. Now
consider the proposition "Red is" (e.g.). Of course no one ever uses it; but if I had to
invent a use for it all the same, it would be this: as an introductory formula to
statements which went on to make use of the word "red". When I pronounce the
formula I look at a sample of the colour red.
One is tempted to pronounce a sentence like "red is" when one is looking attentively at
the colour; that is, in the same situation as that in which one observes the existence of a
thing (of a leaflike insect, for example).
And I want to say: when one uses the expression, "the proof has taught me--shewn
me--that this is the case", one is still using this simile.
Page 64
73. I could also have said: it is not the property of an object that is ever 'essential', but
rather the mark of a concept.
Page 64
74. "If the form of the group was the same, then it must have had the same aspects, the
same possibilities of division. If it has different ones then it isn't the same form;
perhaps it somehow made the same

                                              48
Page Break 65
impression on you; but it is the same form only if you can divide it up in the same
way."
It is as if this expressed the essence of form.--I say, however: if you talk about
essence--, you are merely noting a convention. But here one would like to retort: there
is no greater difference than that between a proposition about the depth of the essence
and one about--a mere convention. But what if I reply: to the depth that we see in the
essence there corresponds the deep need for the convention.
Thus if I say: "It's as if this proposition expressed the essence of form"--I mean: it is as
if this proposition expressed a property of the entity form!--and one can say: the entity
of which it asserts a property, and which I here call the entity 'form', is the picture
which I cannot help having when I hear the word "form".
Page 65
75. But what sort of properties of the hundred marbles did you unfold, or
display?†1--Well, that these things can be done with them.--But what things? Do you
mean that you were able to move them about like that, that they weren't glued on to the
table top?--Not so much that, as that they have gone into these formations without any
loss or addition.--So you have shewn the physical properties of the row. But why did
you use the expression "unfolded"? You would not have spoken of unfolding the
properties of a bar of iron by shewing that it melts at such and such a temperature. And
mightn't you as well say that you unfolded the properties of our memory for numbers,
as the properties of the row (e.g.)? For what you really do unfold, or lay out, is the row
of marbles.--And you shew e.g. that if a row looks thus and thus, or is numbered with
roman numerals in this way, it can be brought into that other memorable arrangement in
a simple way, and without addition or loss of any marble. But this could after all
equally well have been a psychological experiment shewing that you now find
memorable certain patterns into which 100 spots are made merely by shifting them
about.



Page Break 66
Page 66
"I have shewn what can be done with 100 marbles."--You have shewn that these 100
marbles (or those marbles over there), can be laid out in this way. The experiment was
one of laying out (as opposed say to one of burning).
And the psychological experiment might for example have shewn how easy it is for
you to be deceived: i.e. that you don't notice if marbles are smuggled into or out of the
row. One could also say this: I have shewn what can be made of a row of 100 spots by
means of apparent shifts,--what figures can be got out of it by apparent shifts.--But
what did I unfold in this case?
Page 66
76. Imagine it were said: we unfold the properties of a polygon by using diagonals to
take the sides together three at a time. It then proves to be a figure with 24 angles. Do I
want to say I have unfolded a property of the 24-angled polygon? No. I want to say I
have unfolded a property of this polygon (the one drawn here). I now know that there is

                                             49
drawn here a figure with 24 angles.
Is this an experiment? It shews me e.g. what kind of polygon is drawn here now. What I
did can be called an experiment in counting.
But what if I perform such an experiment on a pentagon, which I can already take in at
a glance?--Well, let us assume for a moment that I could not take it in at a
glance,--which (e.g.) may be the case if it is very big. Then drawing the diagonals
would be a way of finding out that this is a pentagon. I could once more say I had
unfolded the properties of the polygon drawn here.--Now if I can take it in at a glance
then surely nothing about it can be changed. It was, perhaps, superfluous to unfold this
property, as it is superfluous to count two apples which are before my eyes.


Page Break 67
Page 67
Ought I to say now: "It was an experiment again, but I was certain of the result"? But
am I certain of the result in the way I am certain of the result of the electrolysis of a
mass of water? No, but in another way. If the electrolysis of the liquid did not yield..., I
should consider myself crazy, or say that I no longer have any idea what to say.
Imagine I were to say: "Yes, here is a square,--but still let's look and see whether a
diagonal divides it into two triangles". Then I draw the diagonal and say: "Yes, here we
have two triangles". Here I should be asked: Couldn't you see that it could be divided
into two triangles? Have you only just convinced yourself that there is a square here;
and why trust your eyes now rather than before?

78. If someone splits up four marbles into two and two, puts them together again, splits
them up again and so on, what is he shewing us? He is impressing on us a
physiognomy and a typical alteration of this physiognomy.
Page 67
79. Think of the possible postures of a puppet. Or suppose you had a chain of, say, ten
links, and you were shewing what kind of characteristic (i.e. memorable) figures it can
be made into. Let the links be numbered; in this way they become an easily memorable
structure even when they lie in a straight line.
So I impress characteristic positions and movements of this chain on you.
If I now say: "Look, this can be made of it too" and display it, am I shewing you an
experiment?--It may be; I am shewing for


Page Break 68
example that it can be got into this shape: but that you didn't doubt. And what interests
you is not something to do with this individual chain.--But all the same isn't what I am

                                             50
displaying a property of this chain? Certainly: but I only display such movements, such
transformations, as are of a memorable kind; and it interests you to learn these
transformations. But the reason why it interests you is that it is so easy to reproduce
them again and again in different objects.
Page 68
80. The words "look what I can make with it--" are indeed the same as I should use if I
were shewing what I can make with a lump of clay, for example. E.g. that I am clever
enough to make such things with this lump. In another case: that this material can be
dealt with like this. Here I should hardly be said to be 'drawing your attention to' the
fact that I can do this, or that the material can stand this;--while in the case of the chain
one would say: I draw your attention to the fact that this can be done with it.--For you
could also have imagined it. But of course you can't get to know any property of the
material by imagining.
The experimental character disappears when one looks at the process simply as a
memorable picture.
Page 68
81. What I unfold may be said to be the role which '100' plays in our calculating
system.
Page 68
82. (I once wrote: "In mathematics process and result are equivalent.")†1



Page Break 69
Page 69
83. And yet I feel that it is a property of '100' that it is, or can be, produced in this way.
But then how can it be a property of the structure '100' to be produced in this way, if
e.g. it didn't get produced in this way at all? If no one multiplied in this way? Surely
only if one could say, it is a property of this sign to be the subject of this rule. For
example it is the property of '5' to be the subject of the rule '3 + 2 = 5'. For only as the
subject of the rule is this number the result of the addition of the other numbers.
But suppose I now say: it is a property of the number... to be the result of the addition
of... according to the rule...?--So it is a property of the number that it arises when we
apply this rule to these numbers. The question is: should we call it 'application of the
rule', if this number were not the result? And that is the same question as: "What do you
understand by 'application of this rule': what you e.g. do with it (and you may apply it
at one time in this way, at another in that), or is 'its application' otherwise explained?"
Page 69
84. "It is a property of this number that this process leads to it.--"But, mathematically
speaking, a process does not lead to it; it is the end of a process (is itself part of the
process).
Page 69
85. But why do I feel that a property of the row is unfolded, is shewn?--Because I
alternately look at what is shewn as essential and as nonessential to the row. Or again:

                                              51
because I think of these properties alternately as external and as internal. Because I
alternately take something as a matter of course and find it noteworthy.

86. "You surely unfold the properties of the hundred marbles


Page Break 70
when you shew what can be made of them."--Can be made of them how? For, that it
can be made of them no one has doubted, so the point must be the kind of way it is
produced from them. But look at that, and see whether it does not perhaps itself
presuppose the result.--
For suppose that in that way you got one time this and another time a different result;
would you accept this? Would you not say: "I must have made a mistake; the same kind
of way would always have to produce the same result". This shows that you are
incorporating the result of the transformation into the kind of way the transforming is
done.

Does it make it clear what kind of row it was before the division, or does it make it
clear what kind of row it is now?

answer "so many"?--(pointing to the group of objects). How does the answer go,
though? There are '50', or '100', etc.

the transformations of another, similarly constructed, chain. What I do, however, does
not shew what I can in fact do with the first one, if it in fact should prove inflexible or
in some other way physically unsuitable.
So after all I cannot say: I unfold the properties of this chain.

marbles the row consists of, or on the other hand that we can move these (say) 100

But when we calculate how the row can be laid out, the calculation shews us what we
call a 'transformation merely by laying out'.

curve partly coincides with the curve; and if a figure shews this, then it does not do so

It could also be said: here you can see that segments of a continuous visual curve are
straight.--But ought I not to have said:--"Now you call this a 'curve'.--And do you call
this little bit of it 'curved' or 'straight'?--Surely you call it a 'straight line'; and the curve
contains this bit."
But why should one not use a new name for visual stretches of a curve which
themselves exhibit no curvature?
"But the experiment of drawing these lines has shewn that they do not touch at a

point to a picture of what it is like for them to 'touch at a point'? Why shouldn't I simply
say the experiment has yielded the result that they, i.e. a curved and a straight line,
touch one another? For isn't this what I call a "touching" of such lines?
Page 72
97. Let us draw a circle composed of black and white segments getting smaller and
smaller.




"Which is the first of these segments--going from left to right--that strikes you as
straight?" Here I am making an experiment.


Page Break 73
Page 73
98. What if someone were to say "Experience tells me that this line




is curved"?--Here it would have to be said that the words "this line" mean the line
drawn on the paper. The experiment can actually be made, one can show this line to
different people and ask: "What do you see, a straight line or a curved one?"--
But suppose someone were to say: "I am now imagining a curved line", whereupon we
tell him: "So you see that the line is a curved one"--what kind of sense would that
make?

                                             54
One can however also say: "I am imagining a circle made of black and white segments;
one is big and curved, the ones that come after it keep on getting smaller, the sixth is
quite straight". Where is the experiment here?
I can calculate in the medium of imagination, but not experiment.
Page 73
99. What is the characteristic use of the derivation procedure as a calculation--as
opposed to its use as an experiment?
We regard the calculation as demonstrating an internal property (a property of the
essence) of the structures. But what does that mean?
The following might serve as a model of an 'internal property':




                                                         10 = 3  3 + 1
Now when I say: 10 strokes necessarily consist of 3 times 3 strokes and 1 stroke--that
does not mean: if there are 10 strokes there, then


Page Break 74
they have always got these figures and loops round them.--But if I put them in, I say
that I was only demonstrating the nature of the group of strokes.--But are you certain
that the group did not change while you were writing those symbols in?--"I don't know;
but a definite number of strokes was there; and if it was not 10 then it was another
number, and in that case it simply had different properties.--"
Page 74
100. One says: calculation 'unfolds' the property of a hundred.--What does it really
mean to say that 100 consists of 50 and 50? One says: the contents of the box consist of
50 apples and 50 pears. But if someone were to say: "The contents of the box consist of
50 apples and 50 apples"--, to begin with we shouldn't know what he meant.--If one
says: "The contents of the box consist of twice 50 apples", this means either that there
are two compartments each containing 50 apples; or what is in question is, say, a
distribution in which each person is supposed to get 50 apples, and now I hear that two
people can be given their share out of this box.
Page 74
101. "The 100 apples in this box consist of 50 and 50"--here the non-temporal character
of 'consist' is important. For it doesn't mean that now, or just for a time, they consist of

                                             55
50 and 50.
Page 74
102. For what is the characteristic mark of 'internal properties'? That they persist
always, unalterably, in the whole that they constitute; as it were independently of any
outside happenings. As the construction of a machine on paper does not break when the
machine itself succumbs to external forces.--Or again, I should like to say that they are
not subject to wind and weather like physical things; rather are they unassailable, like
shadows.


Page Break 75
Page 75
103. When we say: "This proposition follows from that one" here again "to follow" is
being used non-temporally. (And this shews that the proposition does not express the
result of an experiment.)
Page 75
104. Compare "White is lighter than black". This expression too is non-temporal and it
too expresses the existence of an internal relation.
Page 75
105. "But this relation holds"--one would like to say. The question is: has this
proposition a use--and what use? For at the moment all I know is that a picture comes
before my mind as I say it (but that does not guarantee the use for me) and that the
words form an English sentence. But it sticks out that the words are being used
otherwise here than in the everyday case of a useful statement. (As, say, a wheelwright
may notice that the statements that he ordinarily makes about what is circular and
straight are of a different kind from what are to be found in Euclid.) For we say: this
object is lighter than that one, or the colour of this thing is lighter than the colour of that
one, and in this case something is lighter now and may be darker later on.
Whence comes the feeling that "white is lighter than black" expresses something about
the essence of the two colours?--
But is this the right question to ask? For what do we mean by the 'essence' of white or
black? We think perhaps of 'the inside', 'the constitution', but this surely makes no sense
here. We also say e.g.: "It is part of white to be lighter than...".
Is it not like this: the picture of a black and a white patch




serves us simultaneously as a paradigm of what we understand by "lighter"



                                              56
Page Break 76
and "darker" and as a paradigm for "white" and for "black". Now darkness 'is part of'
black inasmuch as they are both represented by this patch. It is dark by being
black.--But to put it better: it is called "black" and hence in our language "dark" too.
That connexion, a connexion of the paradigms and the names, is set up in our language.
And our proposition is non-temporal because it only expresses the connexion of the
words "white", "black" and "lighter" with a paradigm.
Misunderstandings can be avoided by declaring it nonsense to say: "the colour of this
body is brighter than the colour of that one"; what would have to be said is "this body is
brighter than that one". I.e. the former way of putting it is excluded from our language.
Whom do we tell "White is lighter than black"? What information does it give?
Page 76
106. But can't I believe the geometrical proposition even without a proof, for example
on someone else's assurance?--And what does the proposition lose in losing its
proof?--Here I presumably ought to ask: "What can I do with it?", for that is the point.
Accepting the proposition on someone else's assurance--how does my doing this come
out? I may for example use it in further calculating operations, or I use it in judging
some physical fact. If someone assures me, for example, that 13  13 are 196 and I
believe him, then I shall be surprised that I can't arrange 196 nuts in 13 rows of 13
each, and I shall perhaps assume that the nuts have increased of themselves.
But I feel a temptation to say: one can't believe that 13  13 = 196, one can only
accept this number mechanically from somebody else. But why should I not say I
believe it? For is believing it a mysterious act with as it were an underground
connexion with the correct calculation? At any rate I can say: "I believe it", and act
accordingly.


Page Break 77
Page 77
One would like to ask: "What are you doing in believing that 13  13 = 196?" And the
answer may be: Well, that will depend on whether, for instance, you did the sum and
made a slip of the pen in doing so,--or whether somebody else did it, but you yourself
know how such a calculation is done,--or whether you cannot multiply but know that
the product is the number of people to be found in 13 rows of 13 each,--in short it
depends on what you can do with the equation 13  13 = 196. For testing it is doing
something with it.
Page 77
107. The thing is, if one thinks of an arithmetical equation as the expression of an
internal relation, then one would like to say: "You can't believe at all that 13  13
yields this, because that isn't a multiplication of 13 by 13, or is not a case of something
yielded, if 196 comes at the end." But that means that one is not willing to use the word
"believe" for the case of a calculation and its result,--or is willing only in the case in
which one has a correct calculation before one.
Page 77
108. "What are you believing if you believe 13  13 = 196?--"How deep do you
penetrate, one might say, with your belief, into the relation of these numbers? For--one

                                            57
wants to say--you cannot be penetrating all the way, or you could not believe it.
But when have you penetrated into the relations of the numbers? Just while you say that
you believe...? You will not take your stand on that--for it is easy to see that this
appearance is merely produced by the superficial form of our grammar (as it might be
called).
Page 77
109. For I want to say: "One can only see that 13  13 = 169, and even that one can't
believe. And one can--more or less blindly--accept a rule". And what am I doing if I say
this? I am drawing a line between


Page Break 78
the calculation with its result (that is to say a particular picture, a particular model), and
an experiment with its outcome.
Page 78
110. I should like to say: "When I believe that a  b = c--and I do sometimes have
such beliefs--do say that I have them--I am not believing the mathematical proposition,
for that comes at the end of a proof, is the end of a proof; I am believing that this is the
formula that comes in such-and-such a place, which I shall obtain in such-and-such a
way, and so on".--And this does sound as if I were penetrating the process of believing
such a proposition. Whereas I am merely--in an unskilful fashion--pointing to the
fundamental difference, together with an apparent similarity, between the roles of an
arithmetical proposition and an empirical proposition.
For in certain circumstances I do say: "I believe that a  b = c". What do I mean by
this?--What I say!--But what is interesting is the question in what circumstances I say
this and what is characteristic of them in contrast to those of a statement like: "I believe
it is going to rain". For what preoccupies us is this contrast. What we require is a
picture of the employment of mathematical propositions and of sentences beginning "I
believe that...", where a mathematical proposition is the object of belief.
Page 78
111. "But you surely don't believe a mathematical proposition."--That means:
'Mathematical proposition' signifies a role for the proposition, a function, in which
believing does not occur.
Compare: "If you say: 'I believe that castling takes place in such and such a way', then
you are not believing the rule of chess, but believing e.g. that a rule of chess runs like
that".


Page Break 79
Page 79
112. "One can't believe that the multiplication 13  13 yields 169, because the result is
part of the calculation."--What am I calling "the multiplication 13  13"? Only the
correct pattern of multiplication, at the end of which comes 169? Or a 'wrong
multiplication' too?


                                              58
How is it established which pattern is the multiplication 13  13?--Isn't it defined by
the rules of multiplication?--But what if, using these rules, you get different results
today from what all the arithmetic books say? Isn't that possible?--"Not if you apply the
rules as they do!" Of course not! But that is a mere pleonasm. And where does it say
how they are to be applied--and if it does say somewhere, where does it say how that is
to be applied? And that does not mean only: in what book does it say, but also: in what
head?--What then is the multiplication 13  13--or what am I to take as a guide in
multiplying--the rules, or the multiplication that comes in the arithmetic books--if, that
is, these two do not agree?--Well, it never in fact happens that somebody who has learnt
to calculate goes on obstinately getting different results, when he does a given
multiplication, from what comes in the arithmetic books. But if it should happen, then
we should declare him abnormal, and take no further account of his calculation.
Page 79
113. "But am I not compelled, then, to go the way I do in a chain of
inferences?"--Compelled? After all I can presumably go as I choose!--"But if you want
to remain in accord with the rules you must go this way."--Not at all, I call this
'accord'.--"Then you have changed the meaning of the word 'accord', or the meaning of
the rule."--No;--who says what 'change' and 'remaining the same' mean here?
However many rules you give me--I give a rule which justifies my employment of your
rules.


Page Break 80
Page 80
114. We might also say: when we follow the laws of inference (inference-rules) then
following always involves interpretation too.
Page 80
115. "But you surely can't suddenly make a different application of the law now!"--If
my reply is: "Oh yes of course, that is how I was applying it!" or: "Oh! That's how I
ought to have applied it--!"; then I am playing your game. But if I simply reply:
"Different?--But this surely isn't different!"--what will you do? That is: somebody may
reply like a rational person and yet not be playing our game.†1
Page 80
116. "Then according to you everybody could continue the series as he likes; and so
infer anyhow!" In that case we shan't call it "continuing the series" and also presumably
not "inference". And thinking and inferring (like counting) is of course bounded for us,
not by an arbitrary definition, but by natural limits corresponding to the body of what
can be called the role of thinking and inferring in our life.
For we are at one over this, that the laws of inference do not compel him to say or to
write such and such like rails compelling a locomotive. And if you say that, while he
may indeed say it, still he can't think it, then I am only saying that that means, not: try
as he may he can't think it, but: it is for us an essential part of 'thinking' that--in talking,
writing, etc.--he makes this sort of transition. And I say further that the line between
what we include in 'thinking' and what we no longer include in 'thinking' is no more a
hard and fast one than the line between what is still and what is no longer called
"regularity".
Nevertheless the laws of inference can be said to compel us; in the


                                               59
Page Break 81
same sense, that is to say, as other laws in human society. The clerk who infers as in
(17) must do it like that; he would be punished if he inferred differently. If you draw
different conclusions you do indeed get into conflict, e.g. with society; and also with
other practical consequences.
And there is even something in saying: he can't think it. One is trying e.g. to say: he
can't fill it with personal content; he can't really go along with it--personally, with his
intelligence. It is like when one says: this sequence of notes makes no sense, I can't sing
it with expression. I cannot respond to it. Or, what comes to the same thing here: I don't
respond to it.
"If he says it"--one might say--"he can only say it without thinking". And here it merely
needs to be noticed that 'thoughtless' talk and other talk do indeed sometimes differ as
regards what goes on in the talker, his images, sensations and so on while he is talking,
but that this accompaniment does not constitute the thinking, and the lack of it is not
enough to constitute 'thoughtlessness'.
Page 81
117. In what sense is logical argument a compulsion?--"After all you grant this and
this; so you must also grant this!" That is the way of compelling someone. That is to
say, one can in fact compel people to admit something in this way.--Just as one can e.g.
compel someone to go over there by pointing over there with a bidding gesture of the
hand.
Suppose in such a case I point with two fingers at once in different directions, thus
leaving it open to the man to go in which of the two directions he likes,--and another
time I point in only one direction; then this can also be expressed by saying: my first
order did not compel him to go just in one direction, while the second one did. But this
is a statement to tell us what kind of orders I gave; not the way they operate, not
whether they do in fact compel such-and-such a person, i.e. whether he obeys them.


Page Break 82
Page 82
118. It looked at first as if these considerations were meant to shew that 'what seems to
be a logical compulsion is in reality only a psychological one'--only here the question
arose: am I acquainted with both kinds of compulsion, then?!
Imagine that people used the expression: "The law §... punishes a murderer with death".
Now this could only mean: this law runs so and so. That form of expression, however,
might force itself on us, because the law is an instrument when the guilty man is
brought to punishment.--Now we talk of 'inexorability' in connexion with people who
punish. And here it might occur to us to say: "The law is inexorable--men can let the
guilty go, the law executes him". (And even: "the law always executes him".)--What is
the use of such a form of expression?--In the first instance, this proposition only says
that such-and-such is to be found in the law, and human beings sometimes do not go by
the law. Then, however, it does give us a picture of a single inexorable judge, and many
lax judges. That is why it serves to express respect for the law. Finally, the expression
can also be so used that a law is called inexorable when it makes no provision for a
possible act of grace, and in the opposite case it is perhaps called 'discriminating'.

                                            60
Now we talk of the 'inexorability' of logic; and think of the laws of logic as inexorable,
still more inexorable than the laws of nature. We now draw attention to the fact that the
word "inexorable" is used in a variety of ways. There correspond to our laws of logic
very general facts of daily experience. They are the ones that make it possible for us to
keep on demonstrating those laws in a very simple way (with ink on paper for
example). They are to be compared with the facts that make measurement with a
yardstick easy and useful. This suggests the use of precisely these laws of inference,
and now it is we that are inexorable in applying these laws. Because we 'measure'; and
it is part of measuring for everybody to have the same measures. Besides this, however,
inexorable, i.e. unambiguous rules of inference can be distinguished from ones that are
not unambiguous, I mean from such as leave an alternative open to us.


Page Break 83
Page 83
119. "But I can infer only what actually does follow."--That is to say: what the logical
machine really does produce. The logical machine--that would be an all-pervading
ethereal mechanism.--We must give warning against this picture.
Imagine a material harder and more rigid than any other. But if a rod made of this stuff
is brought out of the horizontal into the vertical, it shrinks; or it bends when set upright
and at the same time it is so hard that there is no other way of bending it.--(A
mechanism made of this stuff, say a crank, connecting-rod and crosshead. The different
way the crosshead would move.)
Or again: a rod bends if one brings a certain mass near it; but it is completely rigid in
face of all forces that we subject it to. Imagine that the guide-rails of the crosshead
bend and then straighten again as the crank approaches and retreats. My assumption
would be, however, that no particular external force is necessary to cause this. This
behaviour of the rails would give an impression as of something alive.
When we say: "If the parts of the mechanism were quite rigid, they would move so and
so", what is the criterion for their being quite rigid? Is it that they resist certain forces?
Or that they do move so and so?
Suppose I say: "This is the law of motion of the crosshead (the correlation of its
position and the position of the crank perhaps) when the lengths of the crank and
connecting-rod remain constant". This presumably means: If the crank and crosshead
keep these relative positions, I say that the length of the connecting-rod remains
constant.
Page 83
120. "If the parts were perfectly rigid this is how they would move"; is that a
hypothesis? It seems not. For when we say: "Kinematics describes the movements of
the mechanism on the assumption that its parts are completely rigid", on the one hand
we are admitting that this assumption never squares with reality, and on the other hand
it


Page Break 84
is not supposed to be in any way doubtful that completely rigid parts would move in
this way. But whence this certainty? The question here is not really one of certainty but
of something stipulated by us. We do not know that bodies would move in these ways if
(by such and such criteria) they were quite rigid; but (in certain circumstances) we

                                              61
should certainly call 'rigid' such parts as did move in those ways.--Always remember in
such a case that geometry (or kinematics) does not specify any method of measuring
when it talks about the same, or constant, length.
When therefore we call kinematics the theory, say, of the movement of perfectly rigid
parts of a mechanism, on the one hand this contains an indication as to (mathematical)
method--we stipulate certain distances as the lengths of machine parts that do not
alter--and on the other hand an indication about the application of the calculus.
Page 84
121. The hardness of the logical must. What if one were to say: the must of kinematics
is much harder than the causal must compelling a machine part to move like this when
another moves like this?--
Suppose we represented the movement of the 'perfectly rigid' mechanism by a
cinematographic picture, a cartoon film. Suppose this picture were said to be perfectly
hard, and this meant that we had taken this picture as our method of description--
whatever the facts may be, however the parts of the real mechanism may bend or
expand.
Page 84
122. The machine (its structure) as symbolizing its action: the action of a machine--I
might say at first--seems to be there in it from the start. What does that mean?--
Page 84
If we know the machine, everything else, that is its movement, seems


Page Break 85
to be already completely determined.
Page 85
"We talk as if these parts could only move in this way, as if they could not do anything
else."
Page 85
How is this--do we forget the possibility of their bending, breaking off, melting, and so
on? Yes; in many cases we don't think of that at all. We use a machine, or the picture of
a machine, to symbolize a particular action of the machine. For instance, we give
someone such a picture and assume that he will derive the movement of the parts from
it. (Just as we can give someone a number by telling him that it is the twenty-fifth in the
series 1, 4, 9, 16, ....)
Page 85
"The machine's action seems to be in it from the start" means: you are inclined to
compare the future movements of the machine in definiteness to objects which are
already lying in a drawer and which we then take out.
Page 85
But we do not say this kind of thing when we are concerned with predicting the actual
behaviour of a machine. Here we do not in general forget the possibility of a distortion

                                            62
of the parts and so on.
Page 85
We do talk like that, however, when we are wondering at the way we can use a machine
to symbolize a given way of moving--since it can also move in quite different ways.
Page 85
Now, we might say that a machine, or the picture of it, is the first of a series of pictures
which we have learnt to derive from this one.
Page 85
But when we remember that the machine could also have moved differently, it readily
seems to us as if the way it moves must be contained in the machine-as-symbol far
more determinately than in the actual machine. As if it were not enough here for the
movements in question to be empirically determined in advance, but they had to be
really--in a mysterious sense--already present. And it is quite true: the movement of the
machine-as-symbol is predetermined in a different sense from that in which the
movement of any given actual machine is predetermined.

123. "It is as if we could grasp the whole use of the word in a flash." Like what
e.g.?--Can't the use--in a certain sense--be grasped in a flash? And in what sense can it
not? The point is, that it is as if we could 'grasp it in a flash' in yet another and much
more direct sense than that.--But have you a model for this? No. It is just that this
expression suggests itself to us. As the result of crossing similes.
Page 86
124. You have no model of this superlative fact, but you are seduced into using a super-
expression.
Page 86
125. When does one have the thought: the possible movements of a machine are
already there in it in some mysterious way?--Well, when one is doing philosophy. And
what leads us into thinking that? The way we talk about machines. We say, for
example, that a machine has (possesses) such-and-such possibilities of movement; we
speak of the ideally rigid machine which can only move in such-and-such a way.--What
is this possibility of movement? It is not the movement, but it does not seem to be the
mere physical conditions for moving either, e.g. that there is a certain space between
socket and pin, the pin not fitting too tight in the socket. For while this is the empirical
condition for movement, one could also imagine it to be otherwise. The possibility of a
movement is, rather, supposed to be a shadow of the movement itself. But do you know
of such a shadow? And by a shadow I do not mean some picture of the movement; for
such a picture would not necessarily be a picture of just this movement. But the
possibility of this movement must be the possibility of just this movement. (See how
high the seas of language run here!)
Page 86
The waves subside as soon as we ask ourselves: how do we use the


                                             63
Page Break 87
phrase "possibility of movement" when we are talking about a given machine?--But
then where did our queer ideas come from? Well, I shew you the possibility of a
movement, say by means of a picture of the movement: 'so possibility is something
which is like reality'. We say: "It isn't moving yet, but it already has the possibility of
moving"--'so possibility is something very near reality'. Though we may doubt whether
such-and-such physical conditions make this movement possible, we never discuss
whether this is the possibility of this or of that movement: 'so the possibility of the
movement stands in a unique relation to the movement itself; closer than that of a
picture to its subject'; for it can be doubted whether a picture is the picture of this thing
or that. We say "Experience will shew whether this gives the pin this possibility of
movement", but we do not say "Experience will shew whether this is the possibility of
this movement": 'so it is not an empirical fact that this possibility is the possibility of
precisely this movement'.
Page 87
We pay attention to the expressions we use concerning these things; we do not
understand them, however, but misinterpret them. When we do philosophy we are like
savages, primitive people, who hear the expressions of civilized men, put a false
interpretation on them, and then draw queer conclusions from it.
Page 87
Imagine someone not understanding our past tense: "he has had it".--He says: "'he
has'--that's present, so the proposition says that in some sense the past is present."
Page 87
126. "But I don't mean that what I do now (in grasping a sense) determines the future
use causally and as a matter of experience, but that in a queer way, the use itself is in
some sense present." But of course it is, 'in some sense'! (And don't we also say: "the
events of the years that are past are present to me"?) Really the only thing wrong with
what you say is the expression "in a queer way". The rest is


Page Break 88
correct; and the sentence only seems queer when one imagines a different
language-game for it from the one in which we actually use it. (Someone once told me
that as a child he had wondered how a tailor 'sewed a dress'--he thought this meant that
a dress was produced just by sewing, by sewing one thread on to another.)
Page 88
127. In our failure to understand the use of a word we take it as the expression of a
queer process. (As we think of time as a queer medium, of the mind as a queer kind of
being.)
The difficulty arises in all these cases through mixing up "is" and "is called".
Page 88
128. The connexion which is not supposed to be a causal, experiential one, but much

always a connexion in grammar.

what we say we do. That is to say: we sometimes describe what we do in these words.
But there is nothing astonishing, nothing queer, about what happens. It becomes queer
when we are led to think that the future development must in some way already be


Page Break 89
present in the act of grasping the use and yet isn't present.--For we say that there isn't
any doubt that we understand the word..., and on the other hand its meaning lies in its
use. There is no doubt that I now want to play chess, but chess is the game it is in virtue
of all its rules (and so on). Don't I know, then, which game I wanted to play until I have
played it? Or are all the rules contained in my act of intending? Is it experience that
tells me that this sort of play usually follows this act of intention? So is it impossible
for me to be certain what I am intending to do? And if that is nonsense, what kind of
super-strong connexion exists between the act of intending and the thing
intended?--Where is the connexion effected between the sense of the expression "Let's
play a game of chess" and all the rules of the game?--Well, in the list of rules of the
game, in the teaching of it, in the day-to-day practice of playing.

131. The laws of logic are indeed the expression of 'thinking habits' but also of the
habit of thinking. That is to say they can be said to shew: how human beings think, and
also what human beings call "thinking".
Page 89
132. Frege calls it 'a law about what men take for true' that 'It is impossible for human
beings... to recognize an object as different from itself".†1--When I think of this as
impossible for me, then I think of trying to do it. So I look at my lamp and say: "This
lamp is different from itself". (But nothing stirs.) It is not that I see it is false, I can't do
anything with it at all. (Except when the lamp shimmers in sunlight; then I can quite
well use the sentence to



Page Break 90
express that.) One can even get oneself into a thinking-cramp, in which one does
someone trying to think the impossible and not succeeding. Just as one can also do
someone trying (vainly) to draw an object to himself from a distance by mere willing
(in doing this one makes e.g. certain faces, as if one were trying, by one's expression, to
give the thing to understand that it should come here.)
Page 90
133. The propositions of logic are 'laws of thought', 'because they bring out the essence
of human thinking'--to put it more correctly: because they bring out, or shew, the
essence, the technique, of thinking. They shew what thinking is and also shew kinds of

                                                65
thinking.

'language'.

135. Imagine the following queer possibility: we have always gone wrong up to now in
multiplying 12  12. True, it is unintelligible how this can have happened, but it has
happened. So everything worked out in this way is wrong!--But what does it matter? It
does not matter at all!--And in that case there must be something wrong in our idea of
the truth and falsity of arithmetical propositions.
Page 90
136. But then, is it impossible for me to have gone wrong in my calculation? And what
if a devil deceives me, so that I keep on overlooking something however often I go over
the sum step by step? So that if I were to awake from the enchantment I should say:
"Why, was I blind?"--But what difference does it make for me to 'assume'


Page Break 91
this? I might say: "Yes to be sure, the calculation is wrong--but that is how I calculate.
And this is what I now call adding, and this 'the sum of these two numbers'."
Page 91
137. Imagine someone bewitched so that he calculated:




                         i.e. 4  3 + 2 = 10.
Now he is to apply this calculation. He takes 3 nuts four times over, and then 2 more,
and he divides them among 10 people and each one gets one nut; for he shares them out
in a way corresponding to the loops of the calculation, and as often as he gives
someone a second nut it disappears.
Page 91
138. One might also say: in a proof you advance from one proposition to another; but
do you also accept a check on whether you have gone right?--Or do you merely say "It
must be right" and measure everything else by the proposition you arrive at?
Page 91
139. For if that is how it is, then you are only advancing from one picture to another.

It might be practical, in certain circumstances, to leave numbers out when you were

141. What goes on when someone tries to make a shape coincide with its mirror-image
by moving it about in the plane, and does not succeed? He puts them one on top of the
other in various ways; looks at the parts that don't coincide; is dissatisfied; says
perhaps: "But it must work", and puts the figures together again in another way.
What happens when someone tries to lift a weight and does not succeed because the
weight is too heavy? He assumes such and such a posture, takes hold of the weight,
tenses such and such muscles, and then lets go and perhaps shews dissatisfaction.
How does the geometrical, logical impossibility of the first task come out?
"Well, he could surely have shewn, in a picture or in some other way, what the thing he
is attempting in the second case looks like." But he asserts that he can do that in the
first case too by putting two similar congruent figures together so that they
coincide.--What are we to say now? That the two examples are different? But so are the
picture and the reality in the second case.

143. We teach someone a method of sharing out nuts among


Page Break 93
people; a part of this method is multiplying two numbers in the decimal system.
We teach someone to build a house; and at the same time how he is to obtain a
sufficient quantity of material, boards, say; and for this purpose a technique of
calculation. The technique of calculation is part of the technique of house-building.
People pile up logs and sell them, the piles are measured with a ruler, the measurements
of length, breadth and height multiplied together, and what comes out is the number of
pence which have to be asked and given. They do not know 'why' it happens like this;
they simply do it like this: that is how it is done.--Do these people not calculate?

144. If somebody calculates like this must he utter any 'arithmetical proposition'? Of
course, we teach children the multiplication tables in the form of little sentences, but is
that essential? Why shouldn't they simply: learn to calculate? And when they can do so
haven't they learnt arithmetic?
Page 93
145. But in that case how is the foundation of a calculating procedure related to the
calculation itself?
Page 93
146. "Yes, I understand that this proposition follows from that."--Do I understand why
it follows or do I only understand that it follows?
Page 93
147. Suppose I had said: those people pay for wood on the ground of calculation; they
accept a calculation as proof that they have to pay so much.--Well, that is simply a
description of their procedure (of their behaviour).

148. Those people--we should say--sell timber by cubic measure--but are they right in
doing so? Wouldn't it be more correct to sell it by weight--or by the time that it took to
fell the timber--or by the labour of felling measured by the age and strength of the
woodsman? And why should they not hand it over for a price which is independent of
all this: each buyer pays the same however much he takes (they have found it possible
to live like that). And is there anything to be said against simply giving the wood away?
Page 94
149. Very well; but what if they piled the timber in heaps of arbitrary, varying height
and then sold it at a price proportionate to the area covered by the piles?
And what if they even justified this with the words: "Of course, if you buy more timber,
you must pay more"?
Page 94
150. How could I shew them that--as I should say--you don't really buy more wood if
you buy a pile covering a bigger area?--I should, for instance, take a pile which was
small by their ideas and, by laying the logs around, change it into a 'big' one. This might
convince them--but perhaps they would say: "Yes, now it's a lot of wood and costs
more"--and that would be the end of the matter.--We should presumably say in this
case: they simply do not mean the same by "a lot of wood" and "a little wood" as we
do; and they have a quite different system of payment from us.

be like.
Page 95
153. What does people's agreement about accepting a structure as a proof consist in? In
the fact that they use words as language? As what we call "language".
Imagine people who used money in transactions; that is to say coins, looking like our
coins, which are made of gold and silver and stamped and are also handed over for
goods--but each person gives just what he pleases for the goods, and the merchant does
not give the customer more or less according to what he pays. In short this money, or
what looks like money, has among them a quite different role from among us. We
should feel much less akin to these people than to people who are not yet acquainted
with money at all and practise a primitive kind of barter.--"But these people's coins will
surely also have some purpose!"--Then has everything that one does a purpose? Say
religious actions--.
It is perfectly possible that we should be inclined to call people who behaved like this
insane. And yet we don't call everyone insane who acts similarly within the forms of
our culture, who uses words 'without purpose'. (Think of the coronation of a King.)
Page 95
154. Perspicuity is part of proof. If the process by means of which I get a result were
not surveyable, I might indeed make a note that this number is what comes out--but
what fact is this supposed to confirm for me? I don't know 'what is supposed to come
out'.

Page 96
155. Would it be possible that people should go through one of our calculations to-day
and be satisfied with the conclusions, but to-morrow want to draw quite different
conclusions, and other ones again on another day?
Why, isn't it imaginable that it should regularly happen like that: that when we make
this transition one time, the next time, 'just for that reason', we make a different one,
and therefore (say) the next time the first one again? (As if in some language the colour
which is called "red" one time is for that reason called another name the next time, and
"red" again the next time after that and so on; people might find this natural. It might be
called a need for variety.)
[Note in margin: Are our laws of inference eternal and immutable?]
Page 96
156. Isn't it like this: so long as one thinks it can't be otherwise, one draws logical
conclusions. This presumably means: so long as such-and-such is not brought in
question at all.
The steps which are not brought in question are logical inferences. But the reason why

                                             69
they are not brought in question is not that they 'certainly correspond to the truth'--or
something of the sort,--no, it is just this that is called 'thinking', 'speaking', 'inferring',
'arguing'. There is not any question at all here of some correspondence between what is
said and reality; rather is logic antecedent to any such correspondence; in the same
sense, that is, as that in which the establishment of a method of measurement is
antecedent to the correctness or incorrectness of a statement of length.
Page 96
157. Is it experimentally settled whether one proposition can be derived from
another?--It looks as if it were. For I write down certain sequences of signs, am guided
in doing so by certain paradigms--in doing which it is indeed essential that no sign
should get overlooked


Page Break 97
or otherwise lost--and of what I get in this procedure I say: it follows.--One argument
against this is: If 2 and 2 apples add up to only 3 apples, i.e. if there are 3 apples there
after I have put down two and again two, I don't say: "So after all 2 + 2 are not always
4"; but "Somehow one must have gone".
Page 97
158. But how am I making an experiment when I merely follow a proof which has
already been written out? It might be said: "When you look at this chain of
transformations,--don't they strike you as being in agreement with the paradigms?".
Page 97
159. So if this is to be called an experiment it is presumably a psychological one. For
the appearance of agreement may of course be founded on sense-deception. And so it
sometimes is when we make a slip in calculating.
One also says: "This is my result". And what shews that this is my result is presumably
an experiment.
Page 97
160. One might say: the result of the experiment is that at the end, having reached the
result of the proof, I say with conviction: "Yes, that's right".
Page 97
161. Is a calculation an experiment?--Is it an experiment for me to get out of bed in the
morning? But might it not be an experiment,--to shew whether I have the strength to
raise myself up after so and so many hours' sleep?
And how does the action fall short of being this experiment?--Merely by not being
carried out with this purpose, i.e. in connexion


Page Break 98
with an investigation of this kind. It is the use that is made of something that turns it
into an experiment.
Is an experiment in which we observe the acceleration of a freely falling body a

                                              70
physical experiment, or is it a psychological one shewing what people see in such
circumstances?--Can't it be either? Doesn't it depend on its surroundings: on what we
do with it, say about it?
Page 98
162. If a proof is conceived as an experiment, at any rate the result of the experiment is
not what is called the result of the proof. The result of the calculation is the proposition
with which it concludes; the result of the experiment is that from these propositions, by
means of these rules, I was led to this proposition.
Page 98
163. But our interest does not attach to the fact that such-and-such (or all) human
beings have been led this way by these rules (or have gone this way); we take it as a
matter of course that people--'if they can think correctly'--go this way. We have now
been given a road, as it were by means of the footsteps of those who have gone this
way. And the traffic now proceeds on this road--to various purposes.
Page 98
164. Certainly experience tells me how the calculation comes out; but that is not all
there is to my accepting it.
Page 98
165. I learned empirically that this came out this time, that it usually does come out; but
does the proposition of mathematics say


Page Break 99
that? I learned empirically that this is the road I travelled. But is that the mathematical
statement?--What does it say, though? What relation has it to these empirical
propositions? The mathematical proposition has the dignity of a rule.
So much is true when it's said that mathematics is logic: its moves are from rules of our
language to other rules of our language. And this gives it its peculiar solidity, its
unassailable position, set apart.
(Mathematics deposited among the standard measures.)
Page 99
166. What, then--does it just twist and turn about within these rules?--It forms ever new
rules: is always building new roads for traffic; by extending the network of the old
ones.
Page 99
167. But then doesn't it need a sanction for this? Can it extend the network arbitrarily?
Well, I could say: a mathematician is always inventing new forms of description. Some,
stimulated by practical needs, others, from aesthetic needs,--and yet others in a variety
of ways. And here imagine a landscape gardener designing paths for the layout of a
garden; it may well be that he draws them on a drawing-board merely as ornamental
strips without the slightest thought of someone's sometime walking on them.

169. We know by experience that when we count anything off on the fingers of one
hand, or on some group of things that looks like this | | | | |, and say: I, you, I, you, etc.,
the first word is also the last.


Page Break 100
"But doesn't it have to be like that, then?"--Well, is it unimaginable for someone to see
the group | | | | | (e.g.) as the group | | || | | with the two middle strokes fused, and should
accordingly count the middle stroke twice? (True, it is not the usual case.--)
Page 100
170. But how about when I draw someone's attention for the first time to the fact that
the result of counting off is determined in advance by the beginning, and he
understands and says: "Yes, of course,--that's how it has to be". What sort of knowledge
is this?--He e.g. drew himself the schema:


           IYIYI

           |||||

and his reasoning is e.g.: "That's what it's like when I count off.--So it has to...."
Page 100
(171. Connected with this: We should sometimes like to say "There must surely be a
reason why--in a movement of a sonata, for example--just this theme follows that one."
What we should acknowledge as a reason would be a certain relation between the
themes, a kinship, a contrast or the like.--But we may even construct such a relation: an
operation, so to speak, that produces the one theme from the other; but this serves only
when this relation is one that we are familiar with. So it is as if the sequence of these
themes had to correspond to a paradigm that is already present in us.
Similarly one might say of a picture that shews two human figures: "There must be a
reason why precisely these two faces make such an impression upon us." That means:
we should like to find this impression from the pair of faces again somewhere else--in
another region.--But could we?

One might ask: what arrangement of themes together has a point, and what has no

doesn't.")†1

1. Might I not say that two words--let's write them "non" and "ne"--had the same
meaning, that they were both negation signs--but


non non p = p
and


ne ne p = ne p
(In spoken language a double negation very often means a negation.) But then why do I
call them both "negations"? What have they in common with one another? Well, it is
clear that a great part of their employment is common. But that does not solve our
problem. For we should after all like to say: "It must also hold for both of them that the
double negation is an affirmation, at least if the doubling is thought of appropriately".
But how?--Well, as for example we expressed it using brackets:


(ne ne)p = ne p, ne(ne p) = p
We think at once of an analogous case in geometry: "Two half turns added together
cancel one another out," "Two half turns added together make one half turn."




It just depends how we add them. (Whether we put them side by side or one after the
other.)

2. (Here we stumble on a remarkable and characteristic phenomenon in philosophical
investigation: The difficulty--I might say--isn't one


Page Break 103
of finding the solution; it is one of recognizing something as the solution. We have
already said everything. Not something that follows from this; no, just this is the
solution!
This, I believe, hangs together with our wrongly expecting an explanation; whereas a
description is the solution of the difficulty, if we give it the right place in our
consideration. If we dwell upon it and do not try to get beyond it.)
Page 103
3. "That's already all there is to say about it." Taking "non non p" as the negation of the
negated proposition in the particular case is, say, giving an explanation of the kind "non
non p = non (non p)".
Page 103
4. "If 'ne' is a negation, then 'ne ne p' must be the same as p, if only it is taken
appropriately."
"If one takes 'ne ne p' as negating p, one must be taking the doubling in a different
way."
One would like to say: "'Doubling' means something different in this case and that's
why it yields a negation here;" and so, its yielding a negation here is the consequence
of this difference of nature. "Now I mean it as a strengthening", one would say. We use
the expression of meaning to assess meaning.†1
Page 103
5. When I was uttering the double negation, what may it have



Page Break 104
consisted in that I meant it as a strengthening? In the circumstances in which I use the
expression, perhaps in the image that comes before my mind as I use it or which I
employ, in my tone of voice (as I can even reproduce the brackets in "ne (ne p) in my
tone of voice). In that case, meaning the doubling as a strengthening corresponds to
pronouncing it as a strengthening. The activity of meaning the doubling as a
cancellation was e.g., putting brackets.--"Yes, but these brackets themselves may have a
variety of roles; for who says that they are to be taken as brackets in the ordinary sense
in 'non (non p)' and not for example the first as a hyphen between the two 'non's and the
second as the full stop for the sentence? No one says it. And haven't you yourself
replaced your conception by words? What the brackets mean will come out in their use;
and in another sense perhaps lies in the rhythm of the optical impression of 'non (non
p)'.
Page 104
6. Am I now to say: the meanings of "non" and "ne" are somewhat different? That they

                                              74
are different species of negation?--That no one would say. For it would be objected, in
that case won't "do not go into this room" perhaps fail to mean exactly the same as
usual if we set up the rule that "not not" is to be used as a negation?--But this might be
countered: "If the two propositions 'ne p' and 'non p' say exactly the same, then how can
'ne ne' not mean exactly the same as 'non non'?" But here we are presupposing a
symbolism--i.e., we are taking it as a model--in which from "ne p = non p" it follows
that "ne" and "non" are used in the same way in all cases.
Turning through 180° and negation are in fact the same in the particular case, and the
application of 'non non p = p' is of the same kind as the application of a particular
geometry.


Page Break 105
Page 105
7. What does one mean by saying: 'ne ne p', even if by convention it means 'ne p', could
also be used as a cancelled negation?--One would like to say: "with the meaning that
we have given it, 'ne' could cancel itself, if only we apply it right." What does one mean
by that? (The two half turns in the same direction could cancel one another, if they are
put together appropriately.) "The movement of the negation 'not' is capable of
cancelling itself." But where is this movement? One would like of course to speak of a
mental movement of negation, for the execution of which the sign 'ne' merely gives the
signal.
Page 105
8. We can imagine human beings with a 'more primitive' logic, in which only for certain
sentences is there anything corresponding to our negation: say for such as contain no
negation. In the language of these people, then, a sentence like "He is going into this
house" could be negated; but they would understand a doubling of the negation as mere
repetition, never as cancelling the negation.
Page 105
9. The question whether negation had the same meaning for these people as for us
would be analogous to the question whether the digit '2' means the same, for people
whose number series ends with 5, as it does for us.
Page 105
10. Suppose I were to ask: When we pronounce the proposition "this rod is 1 metre
long" and 'here is 1 soldier', is it quite apparent to us that "1" has different meanings
here?--It is not at all apparent. Especially when we say a sentence like: "On every 1
metre there stands 1 soldier, every 2 metres 2 soldiers, and so on." Asked, "Do you


Page Break 106
mean the same by the two ones?" we should reply: "of course I mean the same:--one"
(perhaps holding up one finger).
Page 106
11. Whoever calls "~~p = p" (or again "~~p  p") a "necessary proposition of logic"
(not a stipulation about the method of presentation that we adopt) also has a tendency to


                                             75
say that this proposition proceeds from the meaning of negation. When double negation
is used as negation in some dialect, as in "he found nothing nowhere", we are inclined
to say: really that would mean that he found something everywhere. Let us consider
what this "really" means.
Page 106
12. Suppose we had two systems for measuring length; in both a length is expressed by
a numeral, followed by a word that gives the system of measurement. One system
designates a length as "n foot" and foot is a unit of length in the ordinary sense; in the
other system a length is designated by "n W" and


           1 foot = 1 W

But: 2 W = 4 foot, 3 W = 9 foot and so on.
So the sentence "this post is 1 W long" says the same as "this post is 1 foot long".
Question: Have "W" and "foot" the same meaning in these two sentences?
Page 106
13. The question is framed wrong. One sees this when we express identity of meaning
by means of an equation. Then the question has to run: "Does W = foot or not?"--The
sentences in which these signs occur disappear in this way of looking at it. Of course in
this terminology one can just as little ask whether "is" means the same as "is";


Page Break 107
but one can ask whether "e" means the same as "=". What we said was: 1 foot = 1 W,
but: foot  W.
Page 107
14. Has "ne" the same meaning as "non"?--Can I replace "non" by "ne"?--"Well, I can
in certain places, but not in others."--But I wasn't asking about that. My question was:
can one, without any further qualification, use "ne" in place of "non"?--No.
Page 107
15. "'ne' and 'non' mean exactly the same in this case."--And what do they
mean?--"Well, one is not to do such and such."--But by saying this you have only said
that in this case ne p = non p and that we don't deny.
When you explain: ne ne p = ne p, non non p = p, you are indeed using the two words
in different ways; and if one holds on to the conception that what they yield in certain
combinations 'depends' on their meaning, or the meaning that they carry around with
them, then one has to say that they must have different meanings if, compounded in the
same way, they may yet yield different results.

16. One would like to speak of the function of the word, of what it does, in this
sentence. As of the function of a lever in a machine. But what does this function consist
in? How does it come to light? For there isn't anything hidden, is there? We see the


                                             76
whole sentence all right. The function must reveal itself in the course of the calculus.
But one wants to say: "'non' does the same with the proposition 'p' as 'ne' does: it
reverses it". But that is just "non p = ne p" in other words.†1 Over and over the thought,
the picture, that what we



Page Break 108
see of the sign is only the exterior of some inner thing in which the real operations of
meaning run on.
Page 108
17. But if the use of a sign is its meaning is it not remarkable that I say the word "is"
gets used with two different meanings (as 'e' and '=') and should not like to say that its
meaning is its use as copula and as sign of identity?
One would like to say that these two kinds of use do not yield a single meaning; the
personal union through the same word is inessential, is mere accident.
Page 108
18. But how can I decide what is an essential and what is an inessential, accidental
feature of the notation? Is there a reality behind the notation, then, which its grammar is
aiming at?
Think of a similar case in a game: In draughts a king is distinguished by putting two
pieces one on top of the other. Won't one say that it is inessential to draughts that this is
the way a king is distinguished?
Page 108
19. Let us say: the meaning of a piece (a figure) is its role in the game.--Now before the
start of any chess-game let it be decided by lot which of the players gets white. For this
purpose one player holds a king in each closed hand and the other chooses one of the
hands at random. Will it be reckoned as part of the role of the king in chess that it is
used for drawing by lot?


Page Break 109
Page 109
20. Thus even in a game I am inclined to distinguish between essential and inessential.
The game, I should like to say, does not just have rules; it has a point.
Page 109
21. What is the word the same for? For in the calculus we make no use of this identity!
What do both players have the same pieces for? But what does "making use of the
identity" mean here? For isn't it a use, if we do use the same word?
Page 109



                                             77
22. Here it looks now as if the use of the same word, the same piece, had a purpose--if
the identity was not accidental, not inessential. And as if the purpose were that one
should recognize the piece and be able to tell how to play. Is it a physical or a logical
possibility that is in question here? If the latter, then the identity of the pieces does
indeed belong to the game.
Page 109
23. The game is supposed to be defined by the rules! So if a rule of the game prescribes
that the kings are to be taken for choosing by lot before the game starts then that
belongs essentially to the game. What objection might be made to this?--That one does
not see the point of this rule. As, say, one wouldn't see the point of a prescription either,
that required one to turn any piece round three times before making a move with it. If
we found this rule in a board-game, we should be surprised, and form conjectures about
the origin, the purpose, of such a rule. ("Is this prescription supposed to prevent one
from moving without consideration?")

1. The surprising may play two completely different parts in mathematics.
One may see the value of a mathematical train of thought in its bringing to light
something that surprises us:--because it is of great interest, of great importance, to see
how such and such a kind of representation of it makes a situation surprising, or
astonishing, even paradoxical.
But different from this is a conception, dominant at the present day, which values the

                                             78
surprising, the astonishing, because it shews the depths to which mathematical
investigation penetrates;--as we might measure the value of a telescope by its shewing
us things that we'd have had no inkling of without this instrument. The mathematician
says as it were: "Do you see, this is surely important, this you would never have known
without me." As if, by means of these considerations, as by means of a kind of higher
experiment, astonishing, nay the most astonishing facts were brought to light.
Page 111
2. But the mathematician is not a discoverer: he is an inventor.
"The demonstration has a surprising result!"--If you are surprised, then you have not
understood it yet. For surprise is not legitimate here, as it is with the issue of an
experiment. There--I should like to say--it is permissible to yield to its charm; but not
when the surprise comes to you at the end of a chain of inference. For here it is only a
sign that unclarity or some misunderstanding still reigns.
"But why should I not be surprised that I have been led hither?"--Imagine you had a
long algebraic expression before you; at first it looks as if it could not be essentially
shortened; but then you see a possibility of shortening it and now it goes on until the
expression


Page Break 112
is shrunk into a compact form. May we not be surprised at this result? (Something
similar happens in playing Patience.) Certainly, and it is a pleasant surprise; and it is of
psychological interest, for it shows a phenomenon of failure to command a clear view
and of the change of aspect of a seen complex. It is interesting that one does not always
see in this complex that it can be shortened in this way; but if we are able to survey the
way of shortening it, the surprise disappears.
When one says that one just is surprised at having been led to this, that does not
represent the situation quite correctly. For one surely has this surprise only when one
does not yet know the way. Not when one has the whole of it before one's eyes. The
fact that this way, that I have completely in view, begins where it begins and ends
where it ends, that's no surprise. The surprise and the interest, then come, so to speak,
from outside. I mean: one can say "This mathematical investigation is of great
psychological interest" or "of great physical interest."
Page 112
3. I keep on being astonished at this turn of the theme; though I have heard it countless
times and know it by heart. It is perhaps its sense to arouse astonishment.
What is it supposed to mean, then, when I say "You oughtn't be astonished?"
Think of mathematical puzzles. They are framed because they surprise: that is their
whole sense.
I want to say: You ought not to believe that there is something hidden here, into which
one can get no insight--as if we had walked through an underground passage and now
come up somewhere into the light, without being able to tell how we got here, or how
the entry of the tunnel lay in relation to its exit.
But then how was it possible for us to fancy this at all? What is there about a
calculation that is like a movement underground? What can have suggested this picture
to us? I believe it is this: no daylight


                                             79

falls on these steps; that we understand the starting point and the end of the calculation
in a sense in which we do not understand the remaining course of the calculation.
Page 113
4. "There's no mystery here!"--but then how can we have so much as believed that there
was one?--Well, I have retraced the path over and over again and over and over again
been surprised; and I never had the idea that here one can understand something.--So
"There's no mystery here!" means "Just look about you!"
Page 113
5. Isn't it as if one saw a sort of turning up of a card in a calculation? One mixed up the
cards; one doesn't know what was going on among them; but in the end this card came
out on top, and this means that rain is coming.

6. The difference between casting lots and counting out before a game. But might not
naive people even when it is a serious matter use counting out instead of choosing a
man by lot?
Page 113
7. What is someone doing when he makes us realize that in counting out the result is
already fixed?
Page 113
8. I want to say: "We don't command a clear view of what we have done, and that is
why it strikes us as mysterious. For now there is a result in front of us and we no longer
know how we got there,


Page Break 114
it is not perspicuous to us, but we say (we have learnt to say): "this is how it has to be";
and we accept it--and marvel at it. Might we not imagine the following case: Someone
has a series of orders of the form "You must now do such and such", each one written
on a card. He mixes these cards up together, reads the one that comes out on top and
says: so I must do that?--For the reading of a written order now makes a particular
impression, has a particular effect on him. And so equally has the reaching of the
conclusion of an inference.--However, one might perhaps break the spell of such an
order, by bringing it clearly before the man's eyes again how he arrived at these words,
and comparing what happened here with other cases--by saying, e.g.: "After all, no one
has given you the order!"
And isn't it like that, when I say "There's no mystery here"?--Indeed, in a certain sense
he had not believed that there was a mystery in the case. But he was under the
impression of mystery (as the other was under the impression of an order). In one sense
he was indeed acquainted with the situation, but he related to it (in feeling and in
action) 'as if there were something else involved'--as we would say.

9. "A definition surely only takes you one step further back, to something that is not
defined." What does that tell us? Did anyone not know that?--No--but may he not have
lost sight of it?
Page 114
10. Or: "If you write


'1, 4, 9, 16....',
you have merely written down four numbers and four dots"--what are you bringing to
our notice here? Could anyone think anything else? It would also be natural to say:
"You have written nothing there except four numerals and a fifth sign--the dots." Well
didn't he know


Page Break 115
this? Still, he might say, mightn't he, "I never really looked on the dots as one further
sign in this series of signs--but rather as a way of suggesting further numerals."
Page 115
11. Or suppose someone gets us to notice that a line, in Euclid's sense, is a boundary of
two coloured surfaces, and not a mark? and a point the intersection of such colour
boundaries and not a dot? (How often has it been said that you cannot imagine a point.)
Page 115
12. It is possible for one to live, to think, in the fancy that things are thus and so,
without believing it; that is to say, when one is asked, then one knows, but if one does
not have to answer the question one does not know, but acts and thinks according to
another opinion.
Page 115
13. For a form of expression makes us act thus and so. When it dominates our thinking,
then in spite of all objections we should like to say: "But surely it is so in some sense."
Although the 'some sense' is just what matters. (Roughly like the way it signifies a
man's dishonesty when we say "He's not a thief".)


Page Break 116
APPENDIX III
Page 116
1. It is easy to think of a language in which there is not a form for questions, or
commands, but question and command are expressed in the form of statements, e.g. in
forms corresponding to our: "I should like to know if..." and "My wish is that...".
No one would say of a question (e.g. whether it is raining outside) that it was true or
false. Of course it is English to say so of such a sentence as "I want to know
whether...". But suppose this form were always used instead of the question?--


                                             81
Page 116
2. The great majority of sentences that we speak, write and read, are statement
sentences.
And--you say--these sentences are true or false. Or, as I might also say, the game of
truth-functions is played with them. For assertion is not something that gets added to
the proposition, but an essential feature of the game we play with it. Comparable, say,
to that characteristic of chess by which there is winning and losing in it, the winner
being the one who takes the other's king. Of course, there could be a game in a certain
sense very near akin to chess, consisting in making the chess moves, but without there
being any winning and losing in it; or with different conditions for winning.
Page 116
3. Imagine it were said: A command consists of a proposal ('assumption') and the
commanding of the thing proposed.


Page Break 117
Page 117
4. Might we not do arithmetic without having the idea of uttering arithmetical
propositions, and without ever having been struck by the similarity between a
multiplication and a proposition?
Should we not shake our heads, though, when someone shewed us a multiplication
done wrong, as we do when someone tells us it is raining, if it is not raining?--Yes; and
here is a point of connexion. But we also make gestures to stop our dog, e.g. when he
behaves as we do not wish.
We are used to saying "2 times 2 is 4", and the verb "is" makes this into a proposition,
and apparently establishes a close kinship with everything that we call a 'proposition'.
Whereas it is a matter only of a very superficial relationship.
Page 117
5. Are there true propositions in Russell's system, which cannot be proved in his
system?--What is called a true proposition in Russell's system, then?
Page 117
6. For what does a proposition's 'being true' mean? 'p' is true = p. (That is the answer.)
So we want to ask something like: under what circumstances do we assert a
proposition? Or: how is the assertion of the proposition used in the language-game?
And the 'assertion of the proposition' is here contrasted with the utterance of the
sentence e.g. as practice in elocution,--or as part of another proposition, and so on.
If, then, we ask in this sense: "Under what circumstances is a proposition asserted in
Russell's game?" the answer is: at the end of one of his proofs, or as a 'fundamental law'
(Pp.). There is no other way in this system of employing asserted propositions in
Russell's symbolism.

Page 118
7. "But may there not be true propositions which are written in this symbolism, but are
not provable in Russell's system?"--'True propositions', hence propositions which are
true in another system, i.e. can rightly be asserted in another game. Certainly; why
should there not be such propositions; or rather: why should not propositions--of
physics, e.g.--be written in Russell's symbolism? The question is quite analogous to:
Can there be true propositions in the language of Euclid, which are not provable in his
system, but are true?--Why, there are even propositions which are provable in Euclid's
system, but are false in another system. May not triangles be--in another system--
similar (very similar) which do not have equal angles?--"But that's just a joke! For in
that case they are not 'similar' to one another in the same sense!"--Of course not; and a
proposition which cannot be proved in Russell's system is "true" or "false" in a different
sense from a proposition of Principia Mathematica.
Page 118
8. I imagine someone asking my advice; he says: "I have constructed a proposition (I
will use 'P' to designate it) in Russell's symbolism, and by means of certain definitions
and transformations it can be so interpreted that it says: 'P is not provable in Russell's
system'. Must I not say that this proposition on the one hand is true, and on the other
hand is unprovable? For suppose it were false; then it is true that it is provable. And
that surely cannot be! And if it is proved, then it is proved that it is not provable. Thus
it can only be true, but unprovable."
Just as we ask: "'provable' in what system?", so we must also ask: "'true' in what
system?" 'True in Russell's system' means, as was said: proved in Russell's system; and
'false in Russell's system' means: the opposite has been proved in Russell's
system.--Now what does your "suppose it is false" mean? In the Russell sense it means
'suppose the opposite is proved in Russell's system'; if that is your assumption, you will
now presumably give up the interpretation that it is


Page Break 119
unprovable. And by 'this interpretation' I understand the translation into this English
sentence.--If you assume that the proposition is provable in Russell's system, that
means it is true in the Russell sense, and the interpretation "P is not provable" again has
to be given up. If you assume that the proposition is true in the Russell sense, the same
thing follows. Further: if the proposition is supposed to be false in some other than the
Russell sense, then it does not contradict this for it to be proved in Russell's system.
(What is called "losing" in chess may constitute winning in another game.)
Page 119
9. For what does it mean to say that P and "P is unprovable" are the same proposition?
It means that these two English sentences have a single expression in such-and-such a
notation.
Page 119
10. "But surely P cannot be provable, for, supposing it were proved, then the
proposition that it is not provable would be proved." But if this were now proved, or if I
believed--perhaps through an error--that I had proved it, why should I not let the proof
stand and say I must withdraw my interpretation "unprovable"?
Page 119
11. Let us suppose I prove the unprovability (in Russell's system) of P; then by this

                                             83
proof I have proved P. Now if this proof were one in Russell's system--I should in that
case have proved at once that it belonged and did not belong to Russell's system.--That
is what comes of making up such sentences.--But there is a contradiction here!--Well,
then there is a contradiction here. Does it do any harm here?


Page Break 120
Page 120
12. Is there harm in the contradiction that arises when someone says: "I am lying.--So I
am not lying.--So I am lying.--etc."? I mean: does it make our language less usable if in
this case, according to the ordinary rules, a proposition yields its contradictory, and vice
versa?--the proposition itself is unusable, and these inferences equally; but why should
they not be made?--It is a profitless performance!--It is a language-game with some
similarity to the game of thumb-catching.
Page 120
13. Such a contradiction is of interest only because it has tormented people, and
because this shews both how tormenting problems can grow out of language, and what
kind of things can torment us.
Page 120
14. A proof of unprovability is as it were a geometrical proof; a proof concerning the
geometry of proofs. Quite analogous e.g. to a proof that such-and-such a construction is
impossible with ruler and compass. Now such a proof contains an element of
prediction, a physical element. For in consequence of such a proof we say to a man:
"Don't exert yourself to find a construction (of the trisection of an angle, say)--it can be
proved that it can't be done". That is to say: it is essential that the proof of unprovability
should be capable of being applied in this way. It must--we might say--be a forcible
reason for giving up the search for a proof (i.e. for a construction of such-and-such a
kind).
A contradiction is unusable as such a prediction.
Page 120
15. Whether something is rightly called the proposition "X is unprovable" depends on
how we prove this proposition. The proof


Page Break 121
alone shews what counts as the criterion of unprovability. The proof is part of the
system of operations, of the game, in which the proposition is used, and shews us its
'sense'.
Thus the question is whether the 'proof of the unprovability of P' is here a forcible
reason for the assumption that a proof of P will not be found.
Page 121
16. The proposition "P is unprovable" has a different sense afterwards--from before it
was proved.
If it is proved, then it is the terminal pattern in the proof of unprovability.--If it is

                                               84
unproved, then what is to count as a criterion of its truth is not yet clear, and--we can
say--its sense is still veiled.
Page 121
17. Now how am I to take P as having been proved? By a proof of unprovability? Or in
some other way? Suppose it is by a proof of unprovability. Now, in order to see what
has been proved, look at the proof. Perhaps it has here been proved that such-and-such
forms of proof do not lead to P.--Or, suppose P has been proved in a direct way--as I
should like to put it--and so in that case there follows the proposition "P is unprovable",
and it must now come out how this interpretation of the symbols of P collides with the
fact of the proof, and why it has to be given up here.
Suppose however that not-P is proved.--Proved how? Say by P's being proved
directly--for from that follows that it is provable, and hence not-P. What am I to say
now, "P" or "not-P"? Why not both? If someone asks me "Which is the case, P, or
not-P?" then I reply: P stands at the end of a Russellian proof, so you write P in the
Russellian system; on the other hand, however, it is then provable and this is expressed
by not-P, but this proposition does not stand at the end of a Russellian proof, and so
does not belong to the Russellian system.


Page Break 122
--When the interpretation "P is unprovable" was given to P, this proof of P was not
known, and so one cannot say that P says: this proof did not exist.--Once the proof has
been constructed, this has created a new situation: and now we have to decide whether
we will call this a proof (a further proof), or whether we will still call this the statement
of unprovability.
Suppose not-P is directly proved; it is therefore proved that P can be directly proved!
So this is once more a question of interpretation--unless we now also have a direct
proof of P. If it were like that, well, that is how it would be.
(The superstitious dread and veneration by mathematicians in face of contradiction.)
Page 122
18. "But suppose, now, that the proposition were false--and hence provable?"--Why do
you call it 'false'? Because you can see a proof?--Or for other reasons? For in that case
it doesn't matter. For one can quite well call the Law of Contradiction false, on the
grounds that we very often make good sense by answering a question "Yes and no".
And the same for the proposition '~~p = p' because we employ double negation as a
strengthening of the negation and not merely as its cancellation.
Page 122
19. You say: "..., so P is true and unprovable". That presumably means: "Therefore P".
That is all right with me--but for what purpose do you write down this 'assertion'? (It is
as if someone had extracted from certain principles about natural forms and
architectural style the idea that on Mount Everest, where no one can live, there
belonged a châlet in the Baroque style. And how could you make the truth of the
assertion plausible to me, since you can make no use of it except to do these bits of
legerdemain?

20. Here one needs to remember that the propositions of logic are so constructed as to
have no application as information in practice. So it could very well be said that they
were not propositions at all; and one's writing them down at all stands in need of
justification. Now if we append to these 'propositions' a further sentence-like structure
of another kind, then we are all the more in the dark about what kind of application this
system of sign-combinations is supposed to have; for the mere ring of a sentence is not
enough to give these connexions of signs any meaning.

1. How far does the diagonal method prove that there is a number which--let's say--is
not a square root? It is of course extremely easy to shew that there are numbers that
aren't square roots--but how does this method shew it?




Have we a general concept of what it means to shew that there is a number that is not
included in this infinite set?


                                           86
Let us suppose that someone had been given the task of naming a number different
from every             ; but that he knew nothing of the diagonal procedure and had
named the number               ; and had shewn that it was not a value of           . Or
that he had said: assume that            = 1.4142... and subtract 1 from the first decimal,
but have the rest of the places agree with           . 1.3142 cannot be a value of
          .
Page 125

2. "Name a number that agrees with             at every second decimal place." What
does this task demand? The question is: is it performed by the answer: It is the number
got by the rule: develop        and add 1 or -1 to every second decimal place?
It is the same as the way the task: Divide an angle into three can be


Page Break 126
regarded as carried out by laying 3 equal angles together.
Page 126
3. If someone says: "Shew me a number different from all these", and is given the rule
of the diagonal for answer, why should he not say: "But I didn't mean it like that!"?
What you have given me is a rule for the step-by-step construction of numbers that are
successively different from each of these.
"But why aren't you willing to call this too a method of calculating a number?"--But
what is the method of calculating, and what the result, here? You will say that they are
one, for it makes sense now to say: the number D is bigger than... and smaller than...; it
can be squared etc. etc.
Is the question not really: What can this number be used for? True, that sounds
queer.--But what it means is: what are its mathematical surroundings?
Page 126
4. So I am comparing methods of calculating--only here there are certainly very
different ways of making comparisons. However, I am supposed in some sense to be
comparing the results of the methods with one another. But this is enough to make
everything unclear, for in one sense they don't each have a single result, or it is not
clear in advance what is to be regarded here as the result in each case. I want to say that
here we are afforded every opportunity of twisting and turning the meanings.
Page 126
5. Let us say--not: "This method gives a result", but rather: "it gives an infinite series of
results". How do I compare infinite series of results? Well, there are very different
things that I may call doing that.

7. The result of a calculation expressed verbally is to be regarded with suspicion. The
calculation illumines the meaning of the expression in words. It is the finer instrument
for determining the meaning. If you want to know what the verbal expression means,
look at the calculation; not the other way about. The verbal expression casts only a dim
general glow over the calculation: but the calculation a brilliant light on the verbal
expression. (As if you wanted to compare the heights of two mountains, not by the
technique of measurement of heights, but by their apparent relation when looked at

8. "I want to shew you a method by which you can serially avoid all these
developments." The diagonal procedure is such a method.--"So it produces a series that
is different from all of these." Is that right?--Yes; if, that is, you want to apply these
words to the described case.
Page 127
9. How would it be with the following method of construction? The diagonal number is
produced by addition or subtraction of 1, but whether to add or subtract is only found
out by continuing the original series to several places. Suppose it were now said: the
development of the diagonal series never catches up with the development of the other
series:--certainly the diagonal series avoids each of those series when it encounters it,
but that is no help to it, as the development of the other series is again ahead of it. Here
I can surely say: There is always one of the series for which it is not determined
whether or not it is different from the diagonal series. It may be said: they run after one
another to infinity, but the original series is always ahead.

might say something like this: I call number-concept X non-denumerable if it has been
stipulated that, whatever numbers falling under this concept you arrange in a series, the
diagonal number of this series is also to fall under that concept.

Here what we have is different pictures; and to them correspond different ways of
talking. But does anything useful emerge if we have a dispute about the justification of
them? What is important must reside

13. Surely--if anyone tried day-in day-out 'to put all irrational numbers into a series' we
could say: "Leave it alone; it means nothing; don't you see, if you established a series, I
should come along with the diagonal series!" This might get him to abandon his
undertaking. Well, that would be useful. And it strikes me as if this were the whole and
proper purpose of this method. It makes use of the vague notion of this man who goes
on, as it were idiotically, with his work, and it brings him to a stop by means of a
picture. (But one could get him to resume his undertaking by means of another picture.)
Page 129
14. The procedure exhibits something--which can in a very vague way be called the
demonstration that these methods of calculation cannot be ordered in a series. And here
the meaning of "these" is just kept vague.
Page 129
15. A clever man got caught in this net of language! So it must be an interesting net.
Page 129
16. The mistake begins when one says that the cardinal numbers can be ordered in a
series. For what concept has one of this ordering? One has of course a concept of an
infinite series, but here that gives


Page Break 130
us at most a vague idea, a guiding light for the formation of a concept. For the concept
itself is abstracted from this and from other series; or: the expression stands for a
certain analogy between cases, and it can e.g. be used to define provisionally a domain
that one wants to talk about.
That, however, is not to say that the question: "Can the set R be ordered in a series?"
has a clear sense. For this question means e.g.: Can one do something with these
formations, corresponding to the ordering of the cardinal numbers in a series? Asked:
"Can the real numbers be ordered in a series?" the conscientious answer might be: "For
the time being I can't form any precise idea of that".--"But you can order the roots and
the algebraic numbers for example in a series; so you surely understand the
expression!"--To put it better, I have got certain analogous formations, which I call by
the common name 'series'. But so far I haven't any certain bridge from these cases to
that of 'all real numbers'. Nor have I any general method of trying whether
such-and-such a set 'can be ordered in a series'.
Now I am shewn the diagonal procedure and told: "Now here you have the proof that
this ordering can't be done here". But I can reply: "I don't know--to repeat--what it is
that can't be done here". Though I can see that you want to shew a difference between
the use of "root", "algebraic number", etc. on the one hand, and "real number" on the

                                            90
other. Such a difference as e.g. this: roots are called "real numbers", and so too is the
diagonal number formed from the roots. And similarly for all series of real numbers.
For this reason it makes no sense to talk about a "series of all real numbers", just
because the diagonal number for each series is also called a "real number".--Would this
not be as if any row of books were itself ordinarily called a book, and now we said: "It
makes no sense to speak of 'the row of all books', since this row would itself be a
book."

Page 131
17. Here it is very useful to imagine the diagonal procedure for the production of a real
number as having been well-known before the invention of set theory, and familiar
even to school-children, as indeed might very well have been the case. For this changes
the aspect of Cantor's discovery. The discovery might very well have consisted merely
in the interpretation of this long familiar elementary calculation.
Page 131
18. For this kind of calculation is itself useful. The question set would be perhaps: write
down a decimal number which is different from the numbers:


           0.1246798...

           0.3469876...

           0.0127649...

           0.3426794...

           ............ (Imagine a long series.)

The child thinks to itself: how am I to do this, when I should have to look at all the
numbers at once, to prevent what I write down from being one of them? Now the
method says: Not at all: change the first place of the first number, the second of the
second one etc. etc., and you are sure of having written down a number that does not
coincide with any of the given ones. The number got in this way might always be called
the diagonal number.
Page 131
19. The dangerous, deceptive thing about the idea: "The real numbers cannot be
arranged in a series", or again "The set... is not denumerable" is that it makes the
determination of a concept--concept formation--look like a fact of nature.
Page 131
20. The following sentence sounds sober: "If something is called a series of real
numbers, then the expansion given by the diagonal

procedure is also called a 'real number', and is moreover said to be different from all

Page 132
21. Our suspicion ought always to be aroused when a proof proves more than its means
allow it. Something of this sort might be called 'a puffed-up proof'.
Page 132
22. The usual expression creates the fiction of a procedure, a method of ordering which,
though applicable here, nevertheless fails to reach its goal because of the number of
objects involved, which is greater even than the number of all cardinal numbers.
If it were said: "Consideration of the diagonal procedure shews you that the concept
'real number' has much less analogy with the concept 'cardinal number' than we, being
misled by certain analogies, are inclined to believe", that would have a good and honest
sense. But just the opposite happens: one pretends to compare the 'set' of real numbers
in magnitude with that of cardinal numbers. The difference in kind between the two
conceptions is represented, by a skew form of expression, as difference of extension. I
believe, and hope, that a future generation will laugh at this hocus pocus.

number"? When and on what occasion woud [[sic]] it be said? This use is at any rate

25. First and foremost, notice that we ask this question at all; this points to the fact that
the answer is not ready to hand.
Moreover, if one tries to answer the question in a hurry, it is easy to trip up. The case is

27. And it can be said that the permission to play language-games with cardinal
numbers has no end. This would be said e.g. to someone to whom we were teaching our
language and language-games. So it would again be a grammatical proposition, but of


                                              92
an entirely different kind from '25  25 = 625'. It would however be of great
importance if the pupil were, say, inclined to expect a definitive end to this series of
language-games (perhaps because he had been brought up in a different culture).

Page 133
29. Cantor's diagonal procedure does not shew us an irrational


Page Break 134
number different from all in the system, but it gives sense to the mathematical
proposition that the number so-and-so is different from all those of the system. Cantor
could say: You can prove that a number is different from all the numbers in the system
by proving that it differs in its first place from its first number and in its second place
from its second number and so on.
Cantor is saying something about the multiplicity of the concept "Real number different
from all the ones of a system".
Page 134
30. Cantor shews that if we have a system of expansions it makes sense to speak of an
expansion that is different from them all.--But that is not enough to determine the
grammar of the word "expansion".
Page 134
31. Cantor gives a sense to the expression "expansion which is different from all the
expansions in a system", by proposing that an expansion should be so called when it
can be proved that it is diagonally different from the expansions in a system.
Page 134
32. Thus it can be set as a question: Find a number whose expansion is diagonally
different from those in this system.
Page 134
33. It might be said: Besides the rational points there are diverse systems of irrational
points to be found in the number line.
There is no system of irrational numbers--but also no super-system, no 'set of irrational
numbers' of higher-order infinity.

Page 135
34. Cantor defines a difference of higher order, that is to say a difference of an
expansion from a system of expansions. This definition can be used so as to shew that a


                                             93
number is in this sense different from a system of numbers: let us say p from the
system of algebraic numbers. But we cannot very well say that the rule of altering the
places in the diagonal in such-and-such a way is as such proved different from the rules
of the system, because this rule is itself of 'higher order'; for it treats of the alteration of
a system of rules, and for that reason it is not clear in advance in which cases we shall
be willing to declare the expansion of such a rule different from all the expansions of
the system.

That is to say: we can make the considerations lead us to that.
Or: we can say this and give this as our reason.
But if we do say it--what are we to do next? In what practice is this proposition

38. An interesting question is: what is the connexion of 0 with the cardinal numbers
whose number it is supposed to be? 0 would obviously be the predicate "infinite
series" in its application to the series of cardinal numbers and to similar mathematical
formations. Here it is important to grasp the relationship between a series in the
nonmathematical sense and one in the mathematical sense. It is of course clear that in
mathematics we do not use the word "series of numbers" in the sense "series of
numerical signs", even though, of course, there is also a connexion between the use of
the one expression and of the other. A railway is not a railway train; nor is it something
similar to a railway train. A 'series' in the mathematical sense is a method of
construction for series of linguistic expressions.
Thus we have a grammatical class "infinite sequence", and equivalent with this
expression a word whose grammar has (a certain) similarity with that of a numeral:
"infinity" or "0". This is connected with the fact that among the calculi of

                                               94
mathematics we have a technique which there is a certain justice in calling "1-1
correlation of the members of two infinite series", since it has a similarity to such a
mutual correlation of the members of what are called 'finite' classes.
From the fact, however, that we have an employment for a kind of numeral which, as it
were, gives the number of the members of an infinite series, it does not follow that it
also makes some kind of sense to speak of the number of the concept 'infinite series';
that we have here some kind of employment for something like a numeral. For there is
no grammatical technique suggesting employment of such an expression. For I can of
course form the expression: "class of all classes which are equinumerous with the class
'infinite series'" (as also: "class of all angels that can get on to a needlepoint") but this
expression is empty so long as there is no employment for it. Such an employment is
not: yet to be discovered, but: still to be invented.

pieces like chess pieces on it--and stated: "This piece is the 'King', these are the

always something.--And perhaps more will be discovered."
Page 137
40. "Fractions cannot be arranged in an order of magnitude."--First and foremost, this
sounds extremely interesting and remarkable.
It sounds interesting in a quite different way from, say, a proposition of the differential
calculus. The difference, I think, resides in the fact that such a proposition is easily
associated with an application to physics, whereas this proposition belongs simply and
solely to mathematics, seems to concern as it were the natural history of mathematical
objects themselves.
One would like to say of it e.g.: it introduces us to the mysteries of the mathematical
world. This is the aspect against which I want to give a warning.
Page 137
41. When it looks as if..., we should look out.
Page 137
42. When, on hearing the proposition that the fractions cannot be arranged in a series in
order of magnitude, I form the picture of an unending row of things, and between each
thing and its neighbour new things appear, and more new ones again between each of
these things and its neighbour, and so on without end, then certainly there is something
here to make one dizzy.
But once we see that this picture, though very exciting, is all the same not appropriate;
that we ought not to let ourselves be trapped by the words "series", "order", "exist", and
others, we shall fall back on the technique of calculating fractions, about which there is
no longer anything queer.

43. The fact that in a technique of calculating fractions the expression "the next greatest
fraction" has no sense, that we have not given it any sense, is nothing to marvel at.
Page 138
44. If we apply a technique of continuous interpolation of fractions, we shall not be
willing to call any fraction the "next biggest".
Page 138
45. To say that a technique is unlimited does not mean that it goes on without ever
stopping--that it increases immeasurably; but that it lacks the institution of the end, that
it is not finished off. As one may say of a sentence that it is not finished off if it has no
period. Or of a playing-field that is unlimited, when the rules of the game do not
prescribe any boundaries--say by means of a line.
Page 138
46. For the point of a new technique of calculation is to supply us with a new picture, a
new form of expression; and there is nothing so absurd as to try and describe this new
schema, this new kind of scaffolding, by means of the old expressions.
Page 138
47. What is the function of such a proposition as: "A fraction has not a next biggest
fraction but a cardinal number has a next biggest cardinal number"? Well, it is as it
were a proposition that compares two games. (Like: in draughts pieces jump over one
another, but not in chess.)

of another--by describing them and emphasizing their differences and analogies.
Page 139
50. "In draughts there isn't a King"--what does this mean? (It sounds childish.) Does it
mean that none of the pieces in draughts is called "King"; and if we did call one of the
pieces that, would there be a King in draughts? But what about this proposition: "In
draughts all the pieces have the same rights, but not in chess"? Whom am I telling this?
One who already knows both games, or else someone who does not yet know them.
Here it looks as if the first one stands in no need of our information and the second can
do nothing with it. But suppose I were to say: "See! In draughts all the pieces have the
same rights,..." or better still: "See! In these games all the pieces have the same rights,
in those not." But what does such a proposition do? It introduces a new concept, a new
ground of classification. I teach you to answer the question: "Name games of the first
sort" etc. But in a similar way it would be possible to set questions like: "Invent a game
with a King".

Surely "a method of numbering the pairs of numbers"? And might I not also say: "of

                                             97
ordering pairs of numbers in a series"?
Page 140
54. Now does mathematics teach me that I can order the pairs of numbers in a series?
Can I say: it teaches me that I can do this? For does it make sense to say that I teach a
child that it is possible to multiply--by teaching him to multiply? It would rather be
natural to say I teach him that it is possible to multiply fractions, after he has learned to
multiply cardinal numbers together. For now, it might be said, he knows what
"multiplying" means. But wouldn't this be misleading too?
Page 140
55. If someone says I have proved the proposition that we can order pairs of numbers in
a series, it should be answered that this is not a mathematical proposition, since one
doesn't calculate with the words "we", "can", "the", "pairs of numbers", etc. The
proposition


Page Break 141
"one can..." is rather a mere approximate description of the technique one is teaching,
say a not unsuitable title, a heading to this chapter. But a title with which it is not
possible to calculate.
Page 141
56. But, you say, this is just what the logical calculus of Frege and Russell does: in it
every word that is spoken in mathematics has exact significance, is an element of the
calculus. Thus in this calculus we can really prove that "multiplying is possible". Very
well, now it is a mathematical proposition; but who says that anything can be done with
this proposition? Who says what use it can be? For its sounding interesting is not
enough.
Just because when we are teaching we may use the proposition "So you see, we can
order the fractions in a series", don't say that we have any other use for this proposition
than of attaching a memorable picture to this sort of calculation.
If the interest here attaches to the proposition that has been proved, then it attaches to a
picture which has an extremely weak justification, but which fascinates us by its
queerness, like e.g. the picture of the "direction" of time. It produces a slight reeling of
one's thoughts.
Page 141
57. Here I can only say: depart as quickly as possible from this picture, and see the
interest of this calculation in its application. (It is as if we were at a masked ball at
which every calculation appears in a queer guise.)

there" is of course clumsy--but it means: is it really necessary here to conjure up the
picture of the infinite (of the enormously big)? And how is this picture connected with
the calculus? For its connexion is not that of the picture | | | | with 4.
Page 142
60. To act as if one were disappointed to have found nothing infinite in the calculus is
of course funny; but not to ask: what is the everyday employment of the word
"infinite", which gives it its meaning for us; and what is its connexion with these
mathematical calculi?

62. What I am doing is, not to shew that calculations are wrong, but to subject the
interest of calculations to a test. I test e.g. the justification for still using the word...
here. Or really, I keep on urging such an investigation. I shew that there is such an
investigation and what there is to investigate there. Thus I must say, not: "We must not
express ourselves like this", or "That is absurd", or "That is uninteresting", but: "Test
the justification of this expression in this way". You cannot survey the justification of
an expression unless you survey its employment; which you cannot do by looking at
some facet of its employment, say a picture attaching to it.

1. 'A mathematical proof must be perspicuous.' Only a structure whose reproduction is
an easy task is called a "proof". It must be possible to decide with certainty whether we
really have the same proof twice over, or not. The proof must be a configuration whose
exact reproduction can be certain. Or again: we must be sure we can exactly reproduce
what is essential to the proof. It may for example be written down in two different
handwritings or colours. What goes to make the reproduction of a proof is not anything
like an exact reproduction of a shade of colour or a hand-writing.
Page 143
It must be easy to write down exactly this proof again. This is where a written proof has
an advantage over a drawing. The essentials of the latter have often been
misunderstood. The drawing of a Euclidian proof may be inexact, in the sense that the
straight lines are not straight, the segments of circles not exactly circular, etc. etc. and at
the same time the drawing is still an exact proof; and from this it can be seen that this
drawing does not--e.g.--demonstrate that such a construction results in a polygon with
five equal sides; that what it proves is a proposition of geometry, not one about the
properties of paper, compass, ruler and pencil.

Now let us imagine a proof for a Russellian proposition stating an addition like 'a + b =
c', consisting of a few thousand signs. You will say: Seeing whether this proof is correct
or not is a purely external difficulty, of no mathematical interest. ("One man takes in
easily what someone else takes in with difficulty or not at all" etc. etc..)
The assumption is that the definitions serve merely to abbreviate the expression for the
convenience of the calculator; whereas they are part of the calculation. By their aid
expressions are produced which could not have been produced without it.
Page 144
3. But how about the following: "While it is true that we cannot--in the ordinary sense--
multiply 234 by 537 in the Russellian calculus, still there is a Russellian calculation
corresponding to this multiplication."--What kind of correspondence is this? It might be
like this: we can carry out this multiplication in the Russellian calculus too, only in a
different symbolism,--just as, as we should certainly say, we can carry it out in a
different number system. In that case, then, we could e.g. solve the practical problems
for which we use that multiplication by means of the calculation in the Russellian
calculus too, only in a more roundabout way.
Page 144
Now let us imagine the cardinal numbers explained as 1, 1 + 1, (1 + 1) + 1, ((1 + 1) +
1) + 1, and so on. You say that the definitions introducing the figures of the decimal
system are a mere matter of convenience; the calculation 703000  40000101 could be
done in that wearisome notation too. But is that true?--"Of course it's true! I can surely
write down, construct, a calculation in that notation corresponding to the calculation in
the decimal notation."--But how do I know that it corresponds to it? Well, because I
have derived it from the other by a given method.--But now if I look at it again

this proposition?--The answer is: no.

Suppose we proved by Russell's method that ($ a ... g) ($ a ... l)  ($ a ... s) is a
tautology; could we reduce our result to g + l's being s? Now this presupposes that I can
take the three bits of the alphabet as representatives of the proof. But does Russell's
proof shew this? After all I could obviously also have carried out Russell's proof with
groups of signs in the brackets whose sequence made no characteristic impression on
me, so that it would not have been possible to represent the group of signs between
brackets by its last term.

Even assuming that the Russellian proof were carried out with a notation such as x1x2...
x10x11... x100... as in the decimal notation, and there were 100 members in the first pair
of brackets, 300 in the second and 400 in the third, does the proof itself shew that 100 +
300 = 400?--What if this proof led at one time to this result, and at another to a
different one, for example 100 + 300 = 420? What is


Page Break 146
needed in order to see that the result of the proof, if it is correctly carried out, always
depends solely on the last figures of the first two pairs of brackets?
Page 146
But still for small numbers Russell does teach us to add; for then we take the groups of
signs in the brackets in at a glance and we can take them as numerals; for example 'xy',
'xyz', 'xyzuv'.
Thus Russell teaches us a new calculus for reaching 5 from 2 and 3; and that is true
even if we say that a logical calculus is only--frills tacked on to the arithmetical
calculus.
Page 146
The application of the calculation must take care of itself. And that is what is correct
about 'formalism'.
Page 146
The reduction of arithmetic to symbolic logic is supposed to shew the point of
application of arithmetic, as it were the attachment by means of which it is plugged in
to its application. As if someone were shewn, first a trumpet without the
mouthpiece--and then the mouthpiece, which shews how a trumpet is used, brought
into contact with the human body. But the attachment which Russell gives us is on the
one hand too narrow, on the other hand too wide; too general and too special. The
calculation takes care of its own application.
Page 146
We extend our ideas from calculations with small numbers to ones with large numbers
in the same kind of way as we imagine that, if the distance from here to the sun could
be measured with a footrule, then we should get the very result that, as it is, we get in a
quite different way. That is to say, we are inclined to take the measurement of length
with a footrule as a model even for the measurement of the distance between two stars.

And one says, e.g. at school: "If we imagine rulers stretching from here to the sun..."
and seems in this way to explain what we understand by the distance between the sun
and the earth. And the use of such a picture is all right, so long as it is clear to us that
we can measure the distance from us to the sun, and that we cannot measure it with
footrules.
Page 147
5. Suppose someone were to say: "The only real proof of 1000 + 1000 = 2000 is after
all the Russellian one, which shews that the expression... is a tautology"? For can I not
prove that a tautology results if I have 1000 members in each of the two first pairs of
brackets and 2000 in the third? And if I can prove that, then I can look at it as a proof
of the arithmetical proposition.
Page 147
In philosophy it is always good to put a question instead of an answer to a question.
For an answer to the philosophical question may easily be unfair; disposing of it by
means of another question is not.
Page 147
Then should I put a question here, for example, instead of the answer that that
arithmetical proposition cannot be proved by Russell's method?
Page 147




6. The proof that                            is a tautology consists in always crossing out
a term of the third pair of brackets for a term of (1) or (2). And there are many methods
for such collating. Or one might even


Page Break 148
say: there are many ways of establishing the success of a 1-1 correlation. One way, for
example, would be to construct a star-shaped pattern for the left-hand side of the
implication and another one for the right-hand side and then to compare these in their
turn by making an ornament out of the two of them.
Thus the rule could be given: "If you want to know whether the numbers A and B
together actually yield C, write down an expression of the form... and correlate the
variables in the brackets by writing down (or trying to) the proof that the expression is
a tautology".
My objection to this is not that it is arbitrary to prescribe just this way of collating, but
that it cannot be established in this way that 1000 + 1000 = 2000.

7. Imagine that you had written down a 'formula' a mile long, and you shewed by
transformation that it was tautologous ('if it has not altered meanwhile', one would have
to say). Now we count the terms in the brackets or we divide them up and make the
expression into one that can be taken in, and it comes out that there are 7566 terms in
the first pair of brackets, 2434 in the second, 10000 in the third. Now have I proved that
2434 + 7566 = 10000?--That depends--one might say--on whether you are certain that
the counting has really yielded the number of terms which stood between the brackets
in the course of the proof.
Page 148
Could one say: "Russell teaches us to write as many variables in the third pair of
brackets as were in the first two together"? But really: he teaches us to write a variable
in (3) for every variable in (1) and (2).
But do we learn from this what number is the sum of two given


Page Break 149
numbers? Perhaps it is said: "Of course, for in the third pair of brackets we have the
paradigm, the prototype of the new number". But in what sense is | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the
paradigm of a number? Consider how it can be used as such.
Page 149
8. Above all, the Russellian tautology corresponding to the proposition a + b = c does
not shew us in what notation the number c is to be written, and there is no reason why it
should not be written in the form a + b.--For Russell does not teach us the technique of,
say, adding in the decimal system.--But could we perhaps derive it from his technique?
Let us just ask the following question: Can one derive the technique of the decimal
system from that of the system 1, 1 + 1, (1 + 1) + 1, etc.?
Could this question not also be formulated as follows: if one has one technique of
calculation in the one system and one in the other,--how is it shewn that the two are
equivalent?
Page 149
9. "A proof ought to shew not merely that this is how it is, but this is how it has to be."
Page 149
In what circumstances does counting shew this?
Page 149
One would like to say: "When the figures and the thing being counted yield a
memorable configuration. When this configuration is now used in place of any fresh
counting."--But here we seem to be talking only of spatial configurations: but if we
know a series of words by heart and then co-ordinate two such series, one to one,
saying for example: "First--Monday; second--Tuesday; third--Wednesday;


Page Break 150
etc."--can we not prove in this way that from Monday to Thursday is four days?

                                                103
For the question is: What do we call a "memorable configuration"? What is the
criterion for its being impressed on our minds? Or is the answer to that: "That we use it
as a paradigm of identity!"?
Page 150
10. We do not make experiments on a sentence or a proof in order to establish its
properties.
Page 150
How do we reproduce, how do we copy, a proof?--Not e.g. by taking measurements of
it.
Page 150
Suppose a proof were so hugely long that it could not possibly be taken in? Or let us
look at a different case: Let there be a long row of strokes engraved in hard rock which
is our paradigm for the number that we call 1000. We call this row the proto-thousand
and if we want to know whether there are a thousand men in a square, we draw lines or
stretch threads. (1-1 correlation.)
Now here the sign of the number 1000 has the identity, not of a shape, but of a physical
object. We could imagine a 'proto-hundred' similarly, and a proof, which we could not
take in at a glance, that 10  100 = 1000.
The figure for 1000 in the system of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1... cannot be recognized by its shape.
Page 150
11. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
Is this pattern a proof of 27 + 16 = 43, because one reaches '27' if one counts the
strokes on the left-hand side, '16' on the right-hand


Page Break 151
side, and '43' when one counts the whole row?
Where is the queerness of calling the pattern the proof of this proposition? It lies in the
kind of way this proof is to be reproduced or known again; in its not having any
characteristic visual shape.
Page 151
Now even if that proof has not any such visual shape, still I can copy (reproduce) it
exactly--so isn't the figure a proof after all? I might e.g. have it engraved on a bit of
steel and passed from hand to hand. So I should tell someone: "Here you have the proof
that 27 + 16 = 43".--Well, can't one say after all that he proves the proposition with the
aid of the pattern? Yes; but the pattern is not the proof.
Page 151
This, however, would surely be called a proof of 250 + 3220 = 3470: one counts on
from 250 and at the same time begins counting from 1 and co-ordinates the two counts:



                                                                         104
           251.... 1

           252....2

           253.... 3

           etc.

3470.... 3220
That could be called a proof in 3220 steps. It is surely a proof--and can it be called
perspicuous?
Page 151
12. What is the invention of the decimal system really? The invention of a system of
abbreviations--but what is the system of the abbreviations? Is it simply the system of
the new signs or is it also a


Page Break 152
system of applying them for the purpose of abbreviation? And if it is the latter, then it is
a new way of looking at the old system of signs.
Page 152
Can we start from the system of 1 + 1 + 1 ... and learn to calculate in the decimal
system through mere abbreviations of the notation?
Page 152
13. Suppose that following Russell I have proved a proposition of the form ($ xyz...) ($
uvw...)  ($ abc...)--and now 'I make it perspicuous' by writing signs x1, x2, x3... over
the variables--am I to say that following Russell I have proved an arithmetical
proposition in the decimal system?
But for every proof in the decimal system there is surely a corresponding one in
Russell's system!--How do we know there is? Let us leave intuition on one side.--But it
can be proved.--
Page 152
If a number in the decimal system is defined in terms of 1, 2, 3,... 9, 0, and the signs 0,
1... 9 in terms of 1, 1 + 1, (1 + 1) + 1,... can one then use the recursive explanation of
the decimal system to reach a sign of the form 1 + 1 + 1... from any number?
Page 152
Suppose someone were to say: Russellian arithmetic agrees with ordinary arithmetic up
to numbers less than 1010; but then it diverges from it. And now he produces a
Russellian proof that 1010 + 1 = 1010. Now why should I not trust such a proof? How
will anybody convince me that I must have miscalculated in the Russellian proof?
Page 152
But then do I need a proof from another system in order to ascertain

                                            105
Page Break 153
whether I have miscalculated in the first proof? Is it not enough for me to write down
that proof in a way that makes it possible to take it in?
Page 153
14. Is not my whole difficulty one of seeing how it is possible, without abandoning
Russell's logical calculus, to reach the concept of the set of variables in the expression
'($ xyz...)', where this expression cannot be taken in?--
Well, but it can be made surveyable by writing: ($ x1, x2, x3, etc.). And still there is
something that I do not understand: the criterion for the identity of such an expression
has now surely been changed: I now see in a different way that the set of signs in two
such expressions is the same.
Page 153
What I am tempted to say is: Russell's proof can indeed be continued step by step, but
at the end one does not rightly know what one has proved--at least not by the old
criteria. By making it possible to command a clear view of the Russellian proof, I prove
something about this proof.
I want to say: one need not acknowledge the Russellian technique of calculation at
all--and can prove by means of a different technique of calculation that there must be a
Russellian proof of the proposition. But in that case, of course, the proposition is no
longer based upon the Russellian proof.
Or again: its being possible to imagine a Russellian proof for every proved proposition
of the form m + n = l does not shew that the proposition is based on this proof. For it is
conceivable that the Russellian proof of one proposition should not be distinguishable
from the Russellian proof of another and should be called different only because they
are the translations of two recognizably different proofs.


Page Break 154
Page 154
Or again: something stops being a proof when it stops being a paradigm, for example
Russell's logical calculus; and on the other hand any other calculus which serves as a
paradigm is acceptable.
Page 154
15. It is a fact that different methods of counting practically always agree.
Page 154
When I count the squares on a chess-board I practically always reach '64'.
Page 154
If I know two series of words by heart, for example numerals and the alphabet, and I
put them into one-one correspondence:


                                            106
           a1

           b2

           c3

           etc.

at 'z' I practically always reach '26'.
Page 154
There is such a thing as: knowing a series of words by heart. When am I said to know
the poem... by heart? The criteria are rather complicated. Agreement with a printed text
is one. What would have to happen to make me doubt that I really know the ABC by
heart? It is difficult to imagine.
But I use reciting or writing down a series of words from memory as a criterion for
equality of numbers, equality of sets.


Page Break 155
Page 155
Ought I now to say: all that doesn't matter--logic still remains the fundamental calculus,
only whether I have the same formula twice is of course differently established in
different cases?
Page 155
16. It is not logic--I should like to say--that compels me to accept a proposition of the
form ($) ($ )  ($ ), when there are a million variables in the first two pairs of
brackets and two million in the third. I want to say: logic would not compel me to
accept any proposition at all in this case. Something else compels me to accept such a
proposition as in accord with logic.
Page 155
Logic compels me only so far as the logical calculus compels me.
Page 155
But surely it is essential to the calculus with 1000000 that this number must be capable
of resolution into a sum 1 + 1 + 1..., and in order to be certain that we have the right
number of units before us, we can number the units:



                                           . This notation would be like:
'100,000.000,000' which also makes the numeral surveyable. And I can surely imagine
someone's having a great sum of money in pennies entered in a book in which perhaps
they appear as numbers of 100 places, with which I have to calculate. I should now
begin to translate them into a surveyable notation, but still I should call them

                                            107
'numerals', should treat them as a record of numbers. For I should even regard it as the
record of a number if someone were to tell me that N has as many shillings as this
vessel will hold peas. Another case again: "He has as many shillings as the Song of
Songs has letters".


Page Break 156
Page 156
17. The notation 'x1, x2, x3,...' gives a shape to the expression '($...)', and so to the
R-proved tautology.
Page 156
Let me ask the following question: Is it not conceivable that the 1-1 correlation could
not be trustworthily carried out in the Russellian proof, that when, for example, we try
to use it for adding, we regularly get a result contradicting the usual one, and that we
blame this on fatigue, which makes us leave out certain steps unawares? And might we
not then say:--if only we didn't get tired we should get the same result--? Because logic
demands it? Does it demand it, then? Aren't we here rectifying logic by means of
another calculus?
Page 156
Suppose we took 100 steps of the logical calculus at a time and now got trustworthy
results, while we don't get them if we try to take all the steps singly--one would like to
say: the calculation is still based on unit steps, since 100 steps at a time is defined by
means of unit steps.--But the definition says: to take 100 steps at a time is the same
thing as..., and yet we take the 100 steps at a time and not 100 unit steps.
Still, in the shortened calculation I am obeying a rule--and how was this rule
justified?--What if the shortened and the unshortened proof yielded different results?
Page 156
18. What I am saying surely comes to this: I can e.g. define '10' as 1 + 1 + 1 + 1...' and
'100  2' as '2 + 2 + 2...' but I cannot therefore necessarily define '100  10' as '10 +
10 + 10 ...', nor yet as '1 + 1 + 1 + 1 ....'


Page Break 157
Page 157
I can find out that 100  100 equals 10000 by means of a 'shortened' procedure. Then
why should I not regard that as the original proof procedure?
Page 157
A shortened procedure tells me what ought to come out with the unshortened one.
(Instead of the other way round.)
Page 157
19. "But the calculation is surely based on the unit steps...." Yes; but in a different way.
For the procedure of proof is a different one.

                                              108
Page 157
I could say for example: 10 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 and in like manner
100 = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10. Have I not based the definition
of 100 on the successive addition of 1? But in the same way as if I had added 100
units? Is there any need at all in my notation for a sign of the form--'1 + 1 + 1...' with
100 components of the sum?
Page 157
The danger here seems to be one of looking at the shortened procedure as a pale
shadow of the unshortened one. The rule of counting is not counting.
Page 157
20. What does taking 100 steps of the calculus 'at once' consist in? Surely in one's
regarding, not the unit step, but a different step, as decisive.


Page Break 158
Page 158
In ordinary addition of whole numbers in the decimal system we make steps in units,
steps in tens, etc. Can one say that the procedure is founded on one of only making unit
steps? One might justify it like this: the result of the addition does indeed look
so--'7583'; but the explanation of this sign, its meaning, which must ultimately receive
expression in its application too, is surely of this sort: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 and so on. But
is it so? Must the numerical sign be explained in this way, or this explanation receive
expression implicitly in its application? I believe that if we reflect it turns out that that
is not the case.
Page 158
Calculating with graphs or with a slide-rule.
Of course when we check the one kind of calculation by the other, we normally get the
same result. But if there are several kinds--who says, if they do not agree, which is the
proper method of calculation, with its roots at the source of mathematics?
Page 158
21. Where a doubt can make its appearance whether this is really the pattern of this
proof, where we are prepared to doubt the identity of the proof, the derivation has lost
its proving power. For the proof serves as a measure.
Page 158
Could one say: it is part of proof to have an accepted criterion for the correct
reproduction of a proof?
Page 158
That is to say, e.g.: we must be able to be certain, it must hold as certain for us, that we
have not overlooked a sign in the course of the

noticing, or by adding one, etc.
Page 159
One might say: When it can be said: "Even if a demon had deceived us, still everything
would be all right", then the prank he wanted to play on us has simply failed of its
purpose.
Page 159
22. Proof, one might say, does not merely shew that it is like this, but: how it is like
this. It shows how 13 + 14 yield 27.
Page 159
"A proof must be capable of being taken in" means: we must be prepared to use it as
our guide-line in judging.
Page 159
When I say "a proof is a picture"--it can be thought of as a cinematographic picture.
Page 159
We construct the proof once for all. A proof must of course have the character of a
model.
Page 159
The proof (the pattern of the proof) shews us the result of a procedure (the
construction); and we are convinced that a procedure regulated in this way always leads
to this configuration.
(The proof exhibits a fact of synthesis to us.)

23. When we say that a proof is a model,--we must, of course, not be saying anything
new.
Page 160
Proof must be a procedure of which I say: Yes, this is how it has to be; this must come
out if I proceed according to this rule.
Page 160
Proof, one might say, must originally be a kind of experiment--but is then taken simply
as a picture.
Page 160
If I pour two lots of 200 apples together and count them, and the result is 400, that is
not a proof that 200 + 200 = 400. That is to say, we should not want to take this fact as
a paradigm for judging all similar situations.

                                            110
Page 160
To say: "these 200 apples and these 200 apples come to 400"--means: when one puts
them together, none are lost or added, they behave normally.
Page 160
24. "This is the model for the addition of 200 and 200"--not: "this is the model of the
fact that 200 and 200 added together yield 400". The process of adding did indeed yield
400, but now we take this result as the criterion for the correct addition--or simply: for
the addition--of these numbers.

The proof must be our model, our picture, of how these operations have a result.
Page 161
The 'proved proposition' expresses what is to be read off from the proof-picture.
Page 161
The proof is now our model of correctly counting 200 apples and 200 apples together:
that is to say, it defines a new concept: 'the counting of 200 and 200 objects together'.
Or, as we could also say: "a new criterion for nothing's having been lost or added".
Page 161
The proof defines 'correctly counting together'.
Page 161
The proof is our model for a particular result's being yielded, which serves as an object
of comparison (yardstick) for real changes.
Page 161
25. The proof convinces us of something--though what interests us is, not the mental
state of conviction, but the applications attaching to this conviction.
Page 161
For this reason the assertion that the proof convinces us of the truth of this proposition
leaves us cold,--since this expression is capable of the most various constructions.


Page Break 162
Page 162
When I say: "the proof convinces me of something", still the proposition expressing
this conviction need not be constructed in the proof. As e.g. we multiply, but do not
necessarily write down the result in the form of the proposition '...  ... = ....' So we
shall presumably say: the multiplication gives us this conviction without our ever


                                            111
uttering the sentence expressing it.
Page 162
A psychological disadvantage of proofs that construct propositions is that they easily
make us forget that the sense of the result is not to be read off from this by itself, but
from the proof. In this respect the intrusion of the Russellian symbolism into the proofs
has done a great deal of harm.
Page 162
The Russellian signs veil the important forms of proof as it were to the point of
unrecognizability, as when a human form is wrapped up in a lot of cloth.
Page 162
26. Let us remember that in mathematics we are convinced of grammatical
propositions; so the expression, the result, of our being convinced is that we accept a
rule.
Page 162
Nothing is more likely than that the verbal expression of the result of a mathematical
proof is calculated to delude us with a myth.
Page 162
27. I am trying to say something like this: even if the proved mathematical proposition
seems to point to a reality outside itself, still it is only the expression of acceptance of a
new measure (of reality).

Thus we take the constructability (provability) of this symbol (that is, of the
mathematical proposition) as a sign that we are to transform symbols in such and such a
way.
Page 163
We have won through to a piece of knowledge in the proof? And the final proposition
expresses this knowledge? Is this knowledge now independent of the proof (is the navel
string cut)?--Well, the proposition is now used by itself and without having the proof
attached to it.
Page 163
Why should I not say: in the proof I have won through to a decision?
Page 163
The proof places this decision in a system of decisions.

(I might of course also say: "the proof convinces me that this rule serves my purpose".
But to say this might easily be misleading.)

But does the proof only bring us to the point of going by this rule

Page 164
For the mathematical proposition is to shew us what it makes SENSE to say.
Page 164
The proof constructs a proposition; but the point is how it constructs it. Sometimes, for
example, it first constructs a number and then comes the proposition that there is such a
number. When we say that the construction must convince us of the proposition, that
means that it must lead us to apply this proposition in such-and-such a way. That it
must determine us to accept this as sense, that not.

29. What is in common between the purpose of a Euclidean construction, say the
bisection of a line, and the purpose of deriving a rule from rules by means of logical
inferences?
Page 164
The common thing seems to be that by the construction of a sign I compel the
acceptance of a sign.
Page 164
Could we say: "mathematics creates new expressions, not new propositions"?
Inasmuch, that is, as mathematical propositions are instruments taken up into the
language once for all--and their proof shews the place where they stand.


Page Break 165
Page 165
But in what sense are e.g. Russell's tautologies 'instruments of language'?
Russell at any rate would not have held them to be so. His mistake, if there was one,
can however only have consisted in his not paying attention to their application.
Page 165
The proof makes one structure generate another.
It exhibits the generation of one from others.


                                           113
That is all very well--but still it does quite different things in different cases! What is
the interest of this transition?
Page 165
Even if I think of a proof as something deposited in the archives of language--who says
how this instrument is to be employed, what it is for?
Page 165
30. A proof leads me to say: this must be like this.--Now, I understand this in the case
of a Euclidean proof or the proof of '25 times 25 = 625', but is it also like this in the
case of a Russellian proof, e.g. of ' pq.p::q'? What does 'it must be like this' mean
here in contrast with 'it is like this'? Should I say: "Well, I accept this expression as a
paradigm for all non-informative propositions of this form"?
Page 165
I go through the proof and say: "Yes, this is how it has to be; I must fix the use of my
language in this way".


Page Break 166
Page 166
I want to say that the must corresponds to a track which I lay down in language.
Page 166
31. When I said that a proof introduces a new concept, I meant something like: the
proof puts a new paradigm among the paradigms of the language; like when someone
mixes a special reddish blue, somehow settles the special mixture of the colours and
gives it a name.
But even if we are inclined to call a proof such a new paradigm--what is the exact
similarity of the proof to such a concept-model?
One would like to say: the proof changes the grammar of our language, changes our
concepts. It makes new connexions, and it creates the concept of these connexions. (It
does not establish that they are there; they do not exist until it makes them.)
Page 166
32. What concept is created by 'pp'? And yet I feel as if it would be possible to say
that 'pp' serves as the sign of a concept.
'pp' is a formula. Does a formula establish a concept? One can say: "by the formula...
such-and-such follows from this". Or again: "such-and-such follows from this in the
following way:..." But is that the sort of proposition I want? What, however, about:
"Draw the consequences of this in the following way:..."?
Page 166
33. If I call a proof a model (a picture), then I must also be able to say this of a
Russellian primitive proposition (as the egg-cell of a proof).
Page 166


                                             114
It can be asked: how did we come to utter the sentence 'pp' as


Page Break 167
a true assertion? Well, it was not used in practical linguistic intercourse,--but still there
was an inclination to utter it in particular circumstances (when for example one was
doing logic) with conviction.
Page 167
But what about 'pp'? I see in it a degenerate proposition, which is on the side of truth.
I fix it as an important point of intersection of significant sentences. A pivotal point of
our method of description.
Page 167
34. The construction of a proof begins with some signs or other, and among these some,
the 'constants', must already have meaning in the language. In this way it is essential
that '' and '~' already possess a familiar application, and the construction of a proof in
Principia Mathematica gets its importance, its sense, from this. But the signs of the
proof do not enable us to see this meaning.
Page 167
The 'employment' of the proof has of course to do with that employment of its signs.
Page 167
35. To repeat, in a certain sense even Russell's primitive propositions convince me.
Thus the conviction produced by a proof cannot simply arise from the proof-
construction.
Page 167
36. If I were to see the standard metre in Paris, but were not


Page Break 168
acquainted with the institution of measuring and its connexion with the standard
metre--could I say, that I was acquainted with the concept of the standard metre?
Page 168
Is a proof not also part of an institution in this way?
Page 168
A proof is an instrument--but why do I say "an instrument of language"?
Is a calculation necessarily an instrument of language, then?

37. What I always do seems to be--to emphasize a distinction between the
determination of a sense and the employment of a sense.
Page 168
38. Accepting a proof: one may accept it as the paradigm of the pattern that arises when
these rules are correctly applied to certain patterns. One may accept it as the correct
derivation of a rule of inference. Or as a correct derivation from a correct empirical
proposition; or as the correct derivation from a false empirical proposition; or simply as
the correct derivation from an empirical proposition, of which we do not know whether
it is true or false.
Page 168
But now can I say that the conception of a proof as 'proof of constructability' of the
proved proposition is in some sense a simpler, more primary, one than any other
conception?


Page Break 169
Page 169
Can I therefore say: "Any proof proves first and foremost that this formation of signs
must result when I apply these rules to these formations of signs"? Or: "The proof
proves first and foremost that this formation can arise when one operates with these
signs according to these transformation-rules".--
This would point to a geometrical application. For the proposition whose truth, as I say,
is proved here, is a geometrical proposition--a proposition of grammar concerning the
transformations of signs. It might for example be said: it is proved that it makes sense
to say that someone has got the sign ... according to these rules from ... and ...; but no
sense etc. etc.
Page 169
Or again: when mathematics is divested of all content, it would remain that certain
signs can be constructed from others according to certain rules.--
Page 169
The least that we have to accept would be: that these signs etc. etc.--and accepting this
is a basis for accepting anything else.
Page 169
I should now like to say: the sequence of signs in the proof does not necessarily carry
with it any kind of acceptance. If however it's to be a matter of accepting, this does not
have to be 'geometrical' acceptance.
Page 169
A proof could surely consist of only two steps: say one proposition '(x).fx' and one
'fa'--does the correct transition according to a rule play an important part here?

39. What is unshakably certain about what is proved?
Page 170
To accept a proposition as unshakably certain--I want to say--means to use it as a
grammatical rule: this removes uncertainty from it.
Page 170
"Proof must be capable of being taken in" really means nothing but: a proof is not an
experiment. We do not accept the result of a proof because it results once, or because it
often results. But we see in the proof the reason for saying that this must be the result.
Page 170
What proves is not that this correlation leads to this result--but that we are persuaded to
take these appearances (pictures) as models for what it is like if.....
Page 170
The proof is our new model for what it is like if nothing gets added and nothing taken
away when we count correctly etc.. But these words shew that I do not quite know what
the proof is a model of.
Page 170
I want to say: with the logic of Principia Mathematica it would be possible to justify an
arithmetic in which 1000 + 1 = 1000; and all that would be necessary for this purpose
would be to doubt the sensible correctness of calculations. But if we do not doubt it,
then it is not our conviction of the truth of logic that is responsible.


Page Break 171
Page 171
When we say in a proof: "This must come out"--then this is not for reasons that we do
not see.
Page 171
It is not our getting this result, but its being the end of this route, that makes us accept
it.
Page 171
What convinces us--that is the proof: a configuration that does not convince us is not
the proof, even when it can be shewn to exemplify the proved proposition.
Page 171
That means: it must not be necessary to make a physical investigation of the proof-
configuration in order to shew us what has been proved.

40. If we have a picture of two men, we do not say first that the one appears smaller

than the other, and then that he seems to be further away. It is, one can say, perfectly
possible that the one figure's being shorter should not strike us at all, but only its being
behind. (This seems to me to be connected with the question of the 'geometrical'
conception of proof.)
Page 171
41. "It (the proof) is the model for what is called such-and-such."
Page 171
But what is the transition from '(x).fx' to 'fa' supposed to be a model for? At most for
how inferences can be drawn from signs like '(x).fx'.
I thought of the model as a justification, but here it is not a justification.


Page Break 172
The pattern (x).fx \ fa does not justify the conclusion. If we want to talk about a
justification of the conclusion, it lies outside this schema of signs.
Page 172
And yet there is something in saying that a mathematical proof creates a new
concept.--Every proof is as it were an avowal of a particular employment of signs.
Page 172
But what is it an avowal of? Only of this employment of the rules of transition from
formula to formula? Or is it also an avowal in some sense, of the 'axioms'?
Page 172
Could I say: I avow pp as a tautology?
Page 172
I accept 'pp' as a maxim, e.g. of inference.
Page 172
The idea that proof creates a new concept might also be roughly put as follows: a proof
is not its foundations plus the rules of inference, but a new building--although it is an
example of such and such a style. A proof is a new paradigm.
Page 172
The concept which the proof creates may for example be a new concept of inference, a
new concept of correct inferring. But as for why I accept this as correct inferring, the
reasons for that lie outside the proof.


Page Break 173

                                              118
The proof creates a new concept by creating or being a new sign. Or--by giving the
proposition which is its result a new place. (For the proof is not a movement but a
route.)
Page 173
42. It must not be imaginable for this substitution in this expression to yield anything
else. Or: I must declare it unimaginable. (The result of an experiment, however, can
turn out this way or that.)
Page 173
Still, the case could be imagined in which a proof altered in appearance--engraved in
rock, it is stated to be the same whatever the appearance says.
Page 173
Are you really saying anything but: a proof is taken as proof?
Page 173
Proof must be a procedure plain to view. Or again: the proof is the procedure that is
plain to view.
Page 173
It is not something behind the proof, but the proof, that proves.
Page 173
43. When I say: "it must first and foremost be evident that this substitution really yields
this expression"--I might also say: "I must accept it as indubitable"--but then there must
be good reasons for this: for example, that the same substitution practically always
yields


Page Break 174
the same result etc.. And isn't this exactly what surveyability consists in?
Page 174
I should like to say that where surveyability is not present, i.e. where there is room for a
doubt whether what we have really is the result of this substitution, the proof is
destroyed. And not in some silly and unimportant way that has nothing to do with the
nature of proof.
Page 174
Or: logic as the foundation of all mathematics does not work, and to shew this it is
enough that the cogency of logical proof stands and falls with its geometrical
cogency.†1
Page 174
We incline to the belief that logical proof has a peculiar, absolute cogency, deriving
from the unconditional certainty in logic of the fundamental laws and the laws of
inference. Whereas propositions proved in this way can after all not be more certain
than is the correctness of the way those laws of inference are applied.

                                            119
Page 174
That is to say: logical proof, e.g. of the Russellian kind, is cogent only so long as it also
possesses geometrical cogency.†1 And an abbreviation of such a logical proof may
have this cogency and so be a proof, when the Russellian construction, completely
carried out, is not.



Page Break 175
Page 175
The logical certainty of proofs--I want to say--does not extend beyond their geometrical
certainty.
Page 175
44. Now if a proof is a model, then the point must be what is to count as a correct
reproduction of the proof.
Page 175
If, for example, the sign '| | | | | | | | | |' were to occur in a proof, it is not clear whether
merely 'the same number' of strokes (or perhaps little crosses) should count as the
reproduction of it, or whether some other, not too small, number does equally well. Etc.
Page 175
But the question is what is to count as the criterion for the reproduction of a proof--for
the identity of proofs. How are they to be compared to establish the identity? Are they
the same if they look the same?
Page 175
I should like, so to speak, to shew that we can get away from logical proofs in
mathematics.
Page 175
45. "By means of suitable definitions, we can prove '25  25 = 625' in Russell's
logic."--And can I define the ordinary technique of proof by means of Russell's? But
how can one technique of proof be defined by means of another? How can one explain
the essence of another? For if the one is an 'abbreviation' of the other, it must surely be
a systematic


Page Break 176
abbreviation. Proof is surely required that I can systematically shorten the long proofs
and thus once more get a system of proofs.
Long proofs at first always go along with the short ones and as it were tutor them. But
in the end they can no longer follow the short ones and these shew their independence.
Page 176


                                               120
The consideration of long unsurveyable logical proofs is only a means of shewing how
this technique--which is based on the geometry of proving--may collapse, and new
techniques become necessary.
Page 176
46. I should like to say: mathematics is a MOTLEY of techniques of proof.--And upon
this is based its manifold applicability and its importance.
Page 176
But that comes to the same thing as saying: if you had a system like that of Russell and
produced systems like the differential calculus out of it by means of suitable
definitions, you would be producing a new bit of mathematics.
Page 176
Now surely one could simply say: if a man had invented calculating in the decimal
system--that would have been a mathematical invention!--Even if he had already got
Russell's Principia Mathematica.--
Page 176
What is it to co-ordinate one system of proofs with another? It involves a translation
rule by means of which proved propositions of


Page Break 177
the one can be translated into proved propositions of the other.
Now it is possible to imagine some--or all--of the proof systems of present-day
mathematics as having been co-ordinated in such a way with one system, say that of
Russell. So that all proofs could be carried out in this system, even though in a
roundabout way. So would there then be only the single system--no longer the
many?--But then it must surely be possible to shew of the one system that it can be
resolved into the many.--One part of the system will possess the properties of
trigonometry, another those of algebra, and so on. Thus one can say that different
techniques are used in these parts.
Page 177
I said: whoever invented calculation in the decimal notation surely made a
mathematical discovery. But could he not have made this discovery all in Russellian
symbols? He would, so to speak, have discovered a new aspect.
Page 177
"But in that case the truth of true mathematical propositions can still be proved from
those general foundations."--It seems to me there is a snag here. When do we say that a
mathematical proposition is true?--
Page 177
It seems to me as if we were introducing new concepts into the Russellian logic without
knowing it.--For example, when we settle what signs of the form '($ x, y, z...)' are to
count as equivalent to one another, and what are not to count as equivalent.


                                           121
Is it a matter of course that '($ x, y, z)' is not the same sign as '($ x, y, z, n)'?


Page Break 178
Page 178
But suppose I first introduce 'p  q' and '~ p' and use them to construct some
tautologies--and then produce (say) the series ~p, ~~p, ~~~p, etc. and introduce a
notation like ~1p, ~2p,... ~10p.... I should like to say: we should perhaps originally
never have thought of the possibility of such a sequence and we have now introduced a
new concept into our calculation. Here is a 'new aspect'.
Page 178
It is clear that I could have introduced the concept of number in this way, even though
in a very primitive and inadequate fashion--but this example gives me all I need.
Page 178
In what sense can it be correct to say that one would have introduced a new concept
into logic with the series ~p, ~~p, ~~~p, etc.?--Well, first of all one could be said to
have done it with the 'etc.'. For this 'etc.' stands for a law of sign formation which is
new to me. A characteristic mark of this is the fact that recursive definition is required
for the explanation of the decimal notation.
Page 178
A new technique is introduced.
Page 178
It can also be put like this: having the concept of the Russellian formation of proofs and
propositions does not mean you have the concept of every series of Russellian signs.


Page Break 179
Page 179
I should like to say: Russell's foundation of mathematics postpones the introduction of
new techniques--until finally you believe that this is no longer necessary at all.
Page 179
(It would perhaps be as if I were to philosophize about the concept of measurement of
length for so long that people forgot that the actual fixing of a unit of length is
necessary before you can measure length.)
Page 179
47. Can what I want to say be put like this: "If we had learnt from the beginning to do
all mathematics in Russell's system, the differential calculus, for example, would not
have been invented just by our having Russell's calculus. So if someone discovered this
kind of calculation in Russell's calculus----."
Page 179

                                               122
Suppose I had Russellian proofs of the propositions


           'p  ~~ p'

           '~ p  ~~~ p'

           'p  ~~~~ p'

and I were now to find a shortened way of proving the proposition


           'p =  ~ 10p'.

It is as if I had discovered a new kind of calculation within the old calculus. What does
its having been discovered consist in?
Page 179
Tell me: have I discovered a new kind of calculation if, having once learnt to multiply, I
am struck by multiplications with all the factors the same, as a special branch of these
calculations, and so I introduce the notation 'an = ...'?


Page Break 180
Page 180

Obviously the mere 'shortened', or different, notation--'162' instead of '16  16'--does
not amount to that. What is important is that we now merely count the factors.

Is '1615' merely another notation for '16  16  16  16  16  16  16  16 
16  16  16  16  16  16  16'?
Page 180

The proof that 1615 = ... does not simply consist in my multiplying 16 by itself fifteen
times and getting this result--the proof must shew that I take the number as a factor 15
times.
Page 180
When I ask "What is new about the 'new kind of calculation'--exponentiation"--that is
difficult to say. The expression 'new aspect' is vague. It means that we now look at the
matter differently--but the question is: what is the essential, the important manifestation
of this 'looking at it differently'?
First of all I want to say: "It need never have struck anyone that in certain products all
the factors are equal"--or: "'Product of all equal factors' is a new concept"--or: "What is
new consists in our classifying calculations differently". In exponentiation the essential
thing is evidently that we look at the number of the factors. But who says we ever
attended to the number of factors? It need not have struck us that there are products
with 2, 3, 4 factors etc. although we have often worked out such products. A new
aspect--but once more: what is important about it? For what purpose do I use what has

                                            123
struck me?--Well, first of all perhaps I put it down in a notation. Thus I write e.g. 'a2'
instead of 'a  a'. By this means I refer to the series of numbers (allude to it), which
did not happen before. So I am surely setting up a new connexion!--A connexion--
between what objects? Between the technique of counting factors and the technique of
multiplying.


Page Break 181
Page 181
But in that way every proof, each individual calculation makes new connexions!
Page 181

But the same proof as shews that a  a  a  a... = b, surely also shews that an = b;
it is only that we have to make the transition according to the definition of 'an'.--
But this transition is exactly what is new. But if it is only a transition to the old proof,
how can it be important?
Page 181
'It is only a different notation.' Where does it stop being--just a different notation?
Page 181
Isn't it where only the one notation and not the other can be used in such-and-such a
way?
Page 181
It might be called "finding a new aspect", if someone writes 'a (f)' instead of 'f (a)'; one
might say: "He looks at the function as an argument of its argument". Or if someone
wrote ' (a)' instead of 'a  a' one could say: "he looks at what was previously
regarded as a special case of a function with two argument places as a function with
one argument place".
If anyone does this he has certainly altered the aspect in a sense, he has for example
classified this expression with others, compared it with others, with which it was not
compared before.--But now, is that an important change of aspect? No, not so long as it
does not have certain consequences.


Page Break 182
Page 182
It is true enough that I changed the aspect of the logical calculation by introducing the
concept of the number of negations: "I never looked at it like that"--one might say. But
this alteration only becomes important when it connects with the application of the
sign.
Page 182
Conceiving one foot as 12 inches would indeed mean changing the aspect of 'a foot',

                                             124
but this change would only become important if one now also measured lengths in
inches.
Page 182
If you introduce the counting of negation signs, you bring in a new way of reproducing
signs.
Page 182
For arithmetic, which does talk about the equality of numbers, it is indeed a matter of
complete indifference how equality of number of two classes is established--but for its
inferences it is not indifferent how its signs are compared with one another, and so e.g.
what is the method of establishing whether the number of figures in two numerical
signs is the same.
Page 182
It is not the introduction of numerical signs as abbreviations that is important, but the
method of counting.

48. I want to give an account of the motley of mathematics.
Page 182
49. "I can carry out the proof that 127 : 18 = 7·05 in Russell's system too." Why
not.--But must the same result be reached in the


Page Break 183
Russellian proof as in ordinary division? The two are of course connected by means of
a type of calculation (by rules of translation, say--); but still, is it not risky to work out
the division by the new technique,--since the truth of the result is now dependent on the
geometry of the rendering?
Page 183
But now suppose someone says: "Nonsense--such considerations play no part in
mathematics".--
Page 183
--But the question is not one of uncertainty, for we are certain of our conclusions, but
of whether we are still doing (Russellian) logic when we e.g. divide.

lengths and angles: it is a bit of mathematics adapted to employment on measurements
of lengths and angles.
Applicability to this field might also be called an 'aspect' of trigonometry.

When I divide a circle into equal sectors and determine the cosine of one of these

If the cosine of an angle has to be determined by measurement, is a proposition of the

Does the proposition say something external about our rulers etc.; or something internal
about our concepts?--How is this to be decided?
Page 184
Do the figures (drawings) in trigonometry belong to pure mathematics, or are they only
examples of a possible application?
Page 184
51. If there is something true about what I am trying to say, then--e.g.--calculating in
the decimal notation must have its own life.--One can of course represent any decimal
number in the form:




and hence carry out the four species of calculation in this notation. But the life of the
decimal notation would have to be independent of calculating with unit strokes.
Page 184
52. In this connexion the following point constantly occurs to me: while indeed a
proposition 'a: b = c' can be proved in Russell's logic, still that logic does not teach us to
construct a correct sentence of this form, i.e. does not teach us to divide. The procedure
of dividing would correspond e.g. to that of a systematic testing of Russellian proofs
with a view, say, to getting the proof of a proposition of the form '37  15 = x'. "But
the technique of such a systematic testing is in its turn founded on logic. It can surely
be logically proved in turn that


Page Break 185
this technique must lead to the goal." So it is like proving in Euclid that such-and-such
can be constructed in such-and-such a way.

He is surely trying to say something like:--If tables, chairs, cupboards, etc. are swathed
in enough paper, certainly they will look spherical in the end.
Page 185
He is not trying to shew that it is impossible that, for every mathematical proof, a
Russellian proof can be constructed which (somehow) 'corresponds' to it, but rather that
the acceptance of such a correspondence does not lean on logic.
Page 185
"But surely we can always go back to the primitive logical method!" Well, assuming
that we can--how is it that we don't have to? Or are we hasty, reckless, if we do not?
But how do we get back to the primitive expression? Do we e.g. take the route through
the secondary proof and back from the end of it into the primary system, and then look
to see where we have got; or do we go forward in both systems and then connect the
end points? And how do we know that we reach the same result in the primary system
in the two cases?
Does not proceeding in the secondary system carry the power of conviction with it?
Page 185
"But at every step in the secondary system, we can imagine that it


Page Break 186
could be taken in the primary one too!"--That is just it: we can imagine that it could be
done--without doing it.
Page 186
And why do we accept the one in place of the other? On grounds of logic?
Page 186
"But can't one prove logically that both transformations must lead to the same
result?"--But what is in question here is surely the result of transformations of signs!
How can logic decide this?

54. How can the proof in the stroke system prove that the proof in the decimal system
is a proof?
Page 186
Well--isn't it the same for the proof in the decimal system, as it is for a construction in
Euclid of which it is proved that it really is the construction of such-and-such a figure?
Page 186
Can I put it like this: "The translation of the stroke system into the decimal system
presupposes a recursive definition. This definition, however, does not introduce the

                                            127
abbreviation of one expression to another. Yet of course inductive proof in the decimal
system does not contain the whole set of those signs which would have to be translated
by means of the recursive definition into stroke signs. Therefore this general proof
cannot be translated by recursive definition into a proof in the stroke system."?


Page Break 187
Page 187
Recursive definition introduces a new sign-technique.--It must therefore make the
transition to a new 'geometry'. We are taught a new method of recognizing signs. A new
criterion for the identity of signs is introduced.
Page 187
55. A proof shews us what OUGHT to come out.--And since every reproduction of the
proof must demonstrate the same thing, while on the one hand it must reproduce the
result automatically, on the other hand it must also reproduce the compulsion to get it.
That is: we reproduce not merely the conditions which once yielded this result (as in an
experiment), but the result itself. And yet the proof is not a stacked game, inasmuch as
it must always be capable of guiding us.
Page 187
On the one hand we must be able to reproduce the proof in toto automatically, and on
the other hand this reproduction must once more be proof of the result.
Page 187
"Proof must be surveyable": this aims at drawing our attention to the difference
between the concepts of 'repeating a proof', and 'repeating an experiment'. To repeat a
proof means, not to reproduce the conditions under which a particular result was once
obtained, but to repeat every step and the result. And although this shews that proof is
something that must be capable of being reproduced in toto automatically, still every
such reproduction must contain the force of proof, which compels acceptance of the
result.

56. When do we say that one calculus 'corresponds' to another, is only an abbreviated
form of the first?--"Well, when the results of the latter can be translated by means of
suitable definitions into the results of the former." But has it been said how one is to
calculate with these definitions? What makes us accept this translation? Is it a stacked
game in the end? It is, if we are decided on only accepting the translation that leads to
the accustomed result.
Page 188
Why do we call a part of the Russellian calculus the part corresponding to the
differential calculus?--Because the propositions of the differential calculus are proved
in it.--But, ultimately, after the event.--But does that matter? Sufficient that proofs of
these propositions can be found in the Russellian system! But aren't they proofs of
these propositions only when their results can be translated only into these

                                            128
propositions? But is that true even in the case of multiplying in the stroke system with
numbered strokes?
Page 188
57. Now it must be clearly stated that calculations in the stroke notation will normally
always agree with those in the decimal notation. Perhaps, in order to make sure of
agreement, we shall at some point have to take to getting the stroke-calculation worked
over by several people. And we shall do the same for calculations with still higher
numbers in the decimal system.
But that of course is enough to shew that it is not the proofs in the stroke notation that
make the proofs in the decimal system cogent.


Page Break 189
Page 189
"Still, if we did not have the latter, we could use the former to prove the same
thing."--The same thing? What is the same thing?--Well, the stroke proof will convince
me of the same thing, though not in the same way.--Suppose I were to say: "The place
to which a proof leads us cannot be determined independently of this proof."--Did a
proof in the stroke system demonstrate to me that the proved proposition possesses the
applicability given it by the proof in the decimal system--was it e.g. proved in the
stroke system that the proposition is also provable in the decimal system?
Page 189
58. Of course it would be nonsense to say that one proposition cannot have two
proofs--for we do say just that. But can we not say: this proof shews that... results when
we do this; the other proof shews that this expression results when we do something
else?
For is e.g. the mathematical fact that 129 is divisible by 3 independent of the fact that
this is the result in this calculation? I mean: is the fact of this divisibility independent of
the calculus in which it is a result; or is it a fact of this calculus?
Page 189
Suppose it were said: "By calculating we get acquainted with the properties of
numbers".
But do the properties of numbers exist outside the calculating?
Page 189
"Two proofs prove the same when what they convince me of is the same."--And when
is what they convince me of the same?--How do I know that what they convince me of

59. "Each proof proves not merely the truth of the proposition proved, but also that it
can be proved in this way."--But this latter can also be proved in another way.--"Yes,
but the proof proves this in a particular way and in doing so proves that it can be
demonstrated in this way."--But even that could be shewn by means of a different
proof.--"Yes, but then not in this way."--
But this means e.g.: this proof is a mathematical entity that cannot be replaced by any
other; one can say that it can convince us of something that nothing else can, and this
can be given expression by our assigning to it a proposition that we do not assign to any
other proof.
Page 190
60. But am I not making a crude mistake? For just this is essential to the propositions of
arithmetic and to the propositions of the Russellian logic: various proofs lead to them.
Even: infinitely many proofs lead to any one of them.
Page 190
Is it correct to say that every proof demonstrates something to us which it alone can
demonstrate? Would not--so to speak--the proved proposition then be superfluous, and
the proof itself also be the thing proved?
Page 190
Is it only the proved proposition that the proof convinces me of?


Page Break 191
Page 191
What is meant by: "A proof is a mathematical entity which cannot be replaced by any
other"? It surely means that every single proof has a usefulness which no other one has.
It might be said: "--that every proof, even of a proposition which has already been
proved, is a contribution to mathematics". But why is it a contribution if its only point
was to prove the proposition? Well, one can say: "the new proof shews (or makes) a
new connexion". (But in that case is there not a mathematical proposition saying that
this connexion exists?)
Page 191
What do we learn when we see the new proof--apart from the proposition, which we
already know anyhow? Do we learn something that cannot be expressed in a
mathematical proposition?
Page 191
61. How far does the application of a mathematical proposition depend on what is
allowed to count as a proof of it and what is not?
Page 191
I can surely say: if the proposition '137  373 = 46792' is true in the ordinary sense,
then there must be a multiplication-sum, at the ends of which stand the two sides of this
equation. And a multiplication-sum is a pattern satisfying certain rules.


                                           130
I want to say: if I did not accept the multiplication-sum as one proof of the proposition,
then that would mean that the application of the proposition to multiplication-sums
would be gone.
Page 191
62. Let us remember that it is not enough that two proofs meet in the same

proposition..."--The answer would surely be to shew me certain signs. Very well: what
condition must these signs satisfy? They must be a proof of that proposition--but is that,
say, a geometrical condition? Or a psychological one? Sometimes it could be called a
geometrical condition; where the means of proof are already prescribed and all that is
being looked for is a particular arrangement.

65. Are the propositions of mathematics anthropological propositions saying how we
men infer and calculate?--Is a statute book a work of anthropology telling how the
people of this nation deal with a thief etc.?--Could it be said: "The judge looks up a

Well, the judge does not USE the statute book as a manual of anthropology.

What if we said that mathematical propositions were prophecies in this sense: they
predict what result members of a society who have learnt this technique will get in
agreement with other members of the society? '25  25 = 625' would thus mean that
men, if we judge them to obey the rules of multiplication, will reach the result 625
when they multiply 25  25.--That this is a correct prediction is beyond doubt; and
also that calculating is in essence founded on such predictions. That is to say, we should
not call something 'calculating' if we could not make such a prophecy with certainty.
This really means: calculating is a technique. And what we have said pertains to the
essence of a technique.

consensus is part of the phenomenon of our calculating.
Page 193
In a technique of calculating prophecies must be possible.
Page 193
And that makes the technique of calculating similar to the technique of a game, like
chess.
Page 193
But what about this consensus--doesn't it mean that one human being by himself could
not calculate? Well, one human being could at any rate not calculate just once in his
life.

It might be said: all possible positions in chess can be conceived as propositions saying

reached in this way is then a proved proposition of this kind.

"A calculation is an experiment."--A calculation can be an experiment. The teacher
makes the pupil do a calculation in order to see whether he can calculate; that is an
experiment.
Page 194
When the stove is lit in the morning, is that an experiment? But it could be one.
And in the same way moves in chess are not proofs either, and chess positions are not
propositions. And mathematical propositions are not positions in a game. And in this
way they are not prophecies either.
Page 194
68. If a calculation is an experiment, then what is a mistake in calculation? A mistake in
the experiment? Surely not; it would have been a mistake in the experiment, if I had not
observed the conditions of the experiment--if, e.g., I had made someone calculate when
a terrible noise was going on.
Page 194
But why should I not say: while a mistake in calculating is not a mistake in the
experiment, still, it is a miscarriage of the experiment--sometimes explicable,
sometimes inexplicable?

--Certainly; nor do we know when we go for a walk where exactly we shall be in five
minutes' time--but does that make going for a walk into an experiment?--Very well; but
in the calculation I surely wanted from the beginning to know what the result was going
to be; that was what I was interested in. I am, after all, curious about the result. Not,
however, as what I am going to say, but as what I ought to say.
Page 195
But isn't this just what interests you about this multiplication--how the generality of
men will calculate? No--at least not usually--even if I am running to a common meeting
point with everybody else.
But surely this is just what the calculation shews me experimentally--where this
meeting point is. I as it were let myself unwind and see where I get. And the correct
multiplication is the pattern of the way we all work, when we are wound up like this.
Page 195
Experience teaches that we all find this calculation correct.
Page 195
We let ourselves unwind and get the result of the calculation. But now--I want to
say--we aren't interested in having--under such and such conditions say--actually
produced this result, but in the pattern of our working; it interests us as a convincing,
harmonious, pattern--not, however, as the result of an experiment, but as a path.

identity merely to predict what people will accept. Just as we do not use the proposition
"this notebook is red" only to predict that most people will call it 'red'.
Page 196
"And that's what we call 'the same'." If there did not exist an agreement in what we call
'red', etc. etc., language would stop. But what about the agreement in what we call
'agreement'?
We can describe the phenomenon of a confusion of language; but what are our tokens
of confusion of language? Not necessarily tumult and muddle in action. But rather that,
e.g. I am lost when people talk, I cannot react in agreement with them.

"For me this is not a language-game." But in this case I might also say: though they
accompany their actions with spoken sounds and I cannot call their actions 'confused',
still they haven't a language.--But perhaps their actions would become confused if they
were prevented from emitting those sounds.

mathematics? That science will rely on experiments: and these experiments will be
calculations. But suppose this science became quite exact and in the end even a
'mathematical' science?
Now is the result of these experiments that human beings agree in their calculations, or
that they agree in what they call "agreeing"? And it goes on like that.

It could be said: that science would not function if we did not agree regarding the idea

It is clear that we can make use of a mathematical work for a study in anthropology.
But then one thing is not clear:--whether we

ought to say: "This writing shews us how operating with signs was done among these
people", or: "This writing shews us what parts of mathematics these people had
mastered".
Page 198
73. Can I say, on reaching the end of a multiplication: "So this is what I agree
with!--"?--But can I say it at a single step of the multiplication? E.g. at the step '2  3
= 6'? Any more than I can say: "So this is what I call 'white'!", looking at this paper?
Page 198
It seems to me it would be a similar case if someone were to say: "When I call to mind
what I have done to-day, I am making an experiment (starting myself off), and the
memory that then comes serves to shew me what other people, who saw me, will reply
to the question what I did".
Page 198
What would happen if we rather often had this: we do a calculation and find it correct;
then we do it again and find it isn't right; we believe we overlooked something
before--then when we go over it again our second calculation doesn't seem right, and so
on.
Now should I call this calculating or not?--At any rate he cannot use this calculation to
predict that he will land there again next time.--But could I say that he calculated wrong
this time, because the next time he did not calculate again the same way? I might say:
where this uncertainty existed there would be no calculating.


Page Break 199
Page 199
But on the other hand I say again: 'Calculating is right--as it is done'. There can be no
mistake of calculation in '12  12 = 144'. Why? This proposition has assumed a place
among the rules.
But is '12  12 = 144' the assertion that it is natural to all men to work out 12  12 in
such a way that the answer is 144?
Page 199
74. If I go over a calculation several times so as to be sure of having done it right, and
if I then accept it as correct,--haven't I repeated an experiment so as to be sure that I
shall tick the same way the next time?--But why should going over the calculation three
times convince me that I shall tick the same way the fourth time?--I'd say: I went over
the calculation 'so as to be sure of not having overlooked anything'.
The danger here, I believe, is one of giving a justification of our procedure where there
is no such thing as a justification and we ought simply to have said: that's how we do it.
Page 199
When somebody makes an experiment repeatedly 'always with the same result', has he
at the same time made an experiment which tells him what he will call 'the same result',
i.e. how he uses the word "the same"? If you measure a table with a yardstick, are you
also measuring the yardstick? If you are measuring the yardstick, then you cannot be

                                            135
measuring the table at the same time.
Page 199
Suppose I were to say: "When someone measures the table with a yardstick he is
making an experiment which tells him the results of measuring this table with all other
yardsticks"? It is after all beyond doubt that a measurement with one yardstick can be
used to predict the results of measurement with others. And, further, that if it could


Page Break 200
not--our whole system of measuring would collapse.
No yardstick, it might be said, would be correct, if in general they did not agree.--But
when I say that, I do not mean that then they would all be false.
Page 200
75. Calculating would lose its point, if confusion supervened. Just as the use of the
words "green" and "blue" would lose its point. And yet it seems to be nonsense to
say--that a proposition of arithmetic asserts that there will not be confusion.--Is the
solution simply that the arithmetical proposition would not be false but useless, if
confusion supervened?
Just as the proposition that this room is 16 foot long would not become false, if rulers
and measuring fell into confusion. Its sense, not its truth, is founded on the regular
working of measurements. (But don't be dogmatic here. There are transitional cases
which complicate the discussion.)
Page 200
Suppose I were to say: an arithmetical proposition expresses confidence that confusion
will not supervene.
Then the use of all words expresses confidence that confusion will not supervene.
Page 200
We cannot say, however, that use of the word "green" signifies that confusion will not
supervene--because then the use of the word "confusion" would have in its turn to
assert just the same thing about this word.
Page 200
If '25  25 = 625' expresses the confidence that we shall always find it easy to agree

Or can one equally well be confident that one will see the same colour over there as

What I want to say is: mathematics as such is always measure, not thing measured.
Page 201
76. The concept of calculating excludes confusion.--Suppose someone were to get
different results at different times when he did a multiplication, and saw this, but found
it all right?--But then surely he could not use the multiplication for the same purposes
as we!--Why not? Nor is there anything to say that he would necessarily fare ill if he
did.
Page 201
The conception of calculation as an experiment tends to strike us as the only realistic
one.
Page 201
Everything else, we think, is moonshine. In an experiment we have


Page Break 202
something tangible. It is almost as if one were to say: "When a poet composes he is
making a psychological experiment; that is the only way of explaining how a poem can
have value". We mistake the nature of 'experiment',--believing that whenever we are
keen on knowing the end of a process, it is what we call an "experiment".
Page 202
It looks like obscurantism to say that a calculation is not an experiment. And in the
same way so does the statement that mathematics does not treat of signs, or that pain is
not a form of behaviour. But only because people believe that one is asserting the
existence of an intangible, i.e. a shadowy, object side by side with what we all can
grasp. Whereas we are only pointing to different modes of employment of words.
It is almost as if one were to say: 'Blue' has to stand for a blue object--otherwise we
could not see what the word was for.

77. I have invented a game--realize that whoever begins must always win: so it isn't a
game. I alter it; now it is all right.
Did I make an experiment, whose result was that whoever begins must always win? Or
that we are inclined to play in such a way that this happens? No.--But the result was not
what you would have expected! Of course not; but that does not make the game into an
experiment.
Page 202
But what does it mean not to know why it always has to work out like that? Well, it is
because of the rules.--I want to know how I must alter the rules in order to get a proper

of this

one.--But that is not what I want. I want to keep the general outline of the rules and
only eliminate a mistake.--But that is vague. It is now simply not clear what is to be
considered as the mistake.
Page 203
It is almost like when one says: What is the mistake in this piece of music? It doesn't
sound well on the instruments.--Now the mistake is not necessarily to be looked for in
the instrumentation; it could be looked for in the themes.
Page 203
Let us suppose, however, that the game is such that whoever begins can always win by
a particular simple trick. But this has not been realized;--so it is a game. Now someone
draws our attention to it;--and it stops being a game.
Page 203
What turn can I give this, to make it clear to myself?--For I want to say: "and it stops
being a game"--not: "and we now see that it wasn't a game".
Page 203
That means, I want to say, it can also be taken like this: the other man did not draw our
attention to anything; he taught us a different game in place of our own.--But how can
the new game have made the old one obsolete?--We now see something different, and
can no longer naïvely go on playing.
On the one hand the game consisted in our actions (our play) on the board; and these
actions I could perform as well now as before. But on the other hand it was essential to
the game that I blindly tried to


Page Break 204
win; and now I can no longer do that.
Page 204
78. Let us suppose that people originally practised the four kinds of calculation in the
usual way. Then they began to calculate with bracketed expressions, including ones of
the form (a - a). Then they noticed that multiplications, for example, were becoming
ambiguous. Would this have to throw them into confusion? Would they have to say:
"Now the solid ground of arithmetic seems to wobble"?
Page 204
And if they now demand a proof of consistency, because otherwise they would be in
danger of falling into the bog at every step--what are they demanding? Well, they are
demanding a kind of order. But was there no order before?--Well, they are asking for
an order which appeases them now.--But are they like small children, that merely have
to be lulled asleep?

                                           138
Page 204
Well, multiplication would surely become unusable in practice because of its
ambiguity--that is for the former normal purposes. Predictions based on multiplications
would no longer hit the mark.--(If I tried to predict the length of the line of soldiers that
can be formed from a square 50  50, I should keep on arriving at wrong results.)
Is this kind of calculation wrong, then?--Well, it is unusable for these purposes.
(Perhaps usable for other ones.) Isn't it as if I were once to divide instead of
multiplying? (As can actually happen.)

What is meant by: "You have to multiply here; not divide!"--

Now, what is it for us not to know our way about in our calculus?

Can we be certain that there are not abysses now that we do not see?
But suppose I were to say: The abysses in a calculus are not there if I don't see them!

The propositions 'f(f)' and '~f(f)' sometimes seem to say the same thing and sometimes
opposite things. According as we look at it the proposition 'f(f)' sometimes seems to say
~ f(f), sometimes the opposite. And we sometimes see it as the product of the
substitution:




At other times as:


                                          140
We should like to say: "'Heterological' is not heterological; so by definition it can be
called 'heterological'." And it sounds all right, goes quite smoothly, and the
contradiction need not strike us at all. If we become aware of the contradiction, we
should at first like to say that we do not mean the same thing by the assertion, x is
heterological, in the two cases. The one time it is the unabbreviated assertion,


Page Break 207
the other time the assertion abbreviated according to the definition.
We should then like to get out of the thing by saying: '~f(f) = f1(f)'. But why should we
lie to ourselves like this? Here two contrary routes really do lead--to the same thing.
Or again:--it is equally natural in this case to say '~f(f)' and 'f(f)'.
According to the rule it is an equally natural expression to say that C lies to the right of
the point A and that it lies to the left.




According to this rule--which says that a place lies in the direction of the arrow if the
street that begins in that direction leads to it.
Page 207
Let us look at it from the point of view of the language-games.--
Originally we played the game only with straight streets.----

80. Could it perhaps be imagined that where I see blue, this means that the object that I
see is not blue--that the colour that appears to me always counts as the one that is
excluded? I might for example believe that God always shews me a colour in order to
say: not this.
Or does this work: the colour that I see merely tells me that this colour plays a part in
the description of the object. It corresponds, not to a proposition, but merely to the

                                              141
word "blue". And the description


Page Break 208
of the object can then equally well run: "it is blue", and "it is not blue". Then one says:
the eye only shows me blue, but not the role of this blue.--We compare seeing the
colour with hearing the word "blue" when we have not heard the rest of the sentence.
Page 208
I should like to shew that we could be led to want to describe something's being blue,
both by saying it was blue, and by saying it was not blue.
And so that it is in our hands to make such a shift in the method of projection that 'p'
and '~p' get the same sense. By which, however, they lose it, if I do not introduce
something new as negation.
Page 208
Now a language-game can lose its sense through a contradiction, can lose the character
of a language-game.
And here it is important to say that this character is not described by saying that the
sounds must have a certain effect. For our language-game (2)†1 would lose the
character of a language-game if the builders kept on uttering different sounds instead of
the 4 orders; even if it could be shewn, say physiologically, that it was always these
noises that moved the assistant to bring the stones that he did bring.
Page 208
Even here it could be said that of course the examination of language-games gets its
importance from the fact that language-games continue to function. And so that it gets
its importance from the fact that human beings can be trained to such a reaction to
sounds.

It seems to me that there is a connexion between this and the question whether a
calculation is an experiment made with a view to predicting the course of calculations.
For suppose that one did a calculation and--correctly--predicted that one would
calculate differently the next time, since the circumstances have changed then precisely
by one's already having done the calculation so-and-so many times.
Calculating is a phenomenon which we know from calculating. As language is a
phenomenon which we know from our language.
Page 209
Can we say: 'Contradiction is harmless if it can be sealed off'? But what prevents us
from sealing it off? That we do not know our way about in the calculus. Then that is the
harm. And this is what one means when one says: the contradiction indicates that there
is something wrong about our calculus. It is merely the (local) symptom of a sickness of

                                            142
the whole body. But the body is only sick if we do not know our way about.
The calculus has a secret sickness, means: what we have got is, as it is, not a calculus,
and we do not know our way about--i.e. cannot give a calculus which corresponds 'in
essentials' to this simulacrum of a calculus, and only excludes what is wrong in it.
Page 209
But how is it possible not to know one's way about in a calculus: isn't it there, open to
view?
Let us imagine having been taught Frege's calculus, contradiction and all. But the
contradiction is not presented as a disease. It is, rather, an accepted part of the calculus,
and we calculate with it. (The calculations


Page Break 210
do not serve the usual purpose of logical calculations.)--Now we are set the task of
changing this calculus, of which the contradiction is an entirely respectable part, into
another one, in which this contradiction is not to exist, as the new calculus is wanted
for purposes which make a contradiction undesirable.--What sort of problem is this?
And what sort of inability is it, if we say: "We have not yet found a calculus satisfying
this condition"?
Page 210
When I say: "I don't know my way about in the calculus"--I do not mean a mental state,
but an inability to do something.
Page 210
It is often useful, in order to help clarify a philosophical problem, to imagine the
historical development, e.g. in mathematics, as quite different from what it actually
was. If it had been different no one would have had the idea of saying what is actually
said.
Page 210
I should like to ask something like: "Is it usefulness you are out for in your
calculus?--In that case you do not get any contradiction. And if you aren't out for
usefulness--then it doesn't matter if you do get one."
Page 210
81. Our task is, not to discover calculi, but to describe the present situation.

Page 211
The idea of the predicate which is true of itself etc. does of course lean on
examples--but these examples were stupidities, for they were not thought out at all. But
that is not to say that such predicates could not be applied, and that the contradiction
would not then have its application!
I mean: if one really fixes one's eye on the application, it does not occur to one at all to

                                             143
write 'f(f)'. On the other hand, if one is using the signs in the calculus, without
presuppositions so to speak, one may also write 'f(f)', and must then draw the
consequences and not forget that one has not yet an inkling of a possible practical
application of this calculus.
Page 211
Is the question this: "Where did we forsake the region of usability?"?--
Page 211
For might we not possibly have wanted to produce a contradiction? Have said--with
pride in a mathematical discovery: "Look, this is how we produce a contradiction"?
Might not e.g. a lot of people possibly have tried to produce a contradiction in the
domain of logic, and then at last one person succeeded?
But why should people have tried to do this? Perhaps I cannot at present suggest the
most plausible purpose. But why not e.g. in order to show that everything in this world
is uncertain?
Page 211
These people would then never actually employ expressions of the form f(f), but still
would be glad to lead their lives in the neighbourhood of a contradiction.

"Can I see an order which prevents me from unwittingly arriving at a contradiction?"
That is like saying: shew me an order in my calculus to convince me that I can never in
this way arrive at a number which.... Then I shew him e.g. a recursive proof.
Page 212
But is it wrong to say: "Well, I shall go on. If I see a contradiction, then will be the time
to do something about it."?--Is that: not really doing mathematics? Why should that not
be calculating? I travel this road untroubled; if I should come to a precipice I shall try
to turn round. Is that not 'travelling'?
Page 212
Let us imagine the following case: the people of a certain tribe only know oral
calculation. They have no acquaintance with writing. They teach their children to count
in the decimal system. Among them mistakes in counting are very frequent, digits get
repeated or left out without their noticing. Now a traveller makes a gramophone record
of their counting. He teaches them writing and written calculation, and then shews them
how often they make mistakes when they calculate just by word of mouth.--Would
these people now have to admit that they had not really calculated before? That they
had merely been groping about, whereas now they walk? Might they not perhaps even
say: our affairs went better before, our intuition was not burdened with the dead stuff of
writing? You cannot lay hold of the spirit with a machine. They say perhaps: "If we
repeated a digit then, as your machine asserts--well, that will have been right".
Page 212
We may trust 'mechanical' means of calculating or counting more than our memories.
Why?--Need it be like this? I may have

                                             144
Page Break 213
miscounted, but the machine, once constructed by us in such-and-such a way, cannot
have miscounted. Must I adopt this point of view?--"Well, experience has taught us that
calculating by machine is more trustworthy than by memory. It has taught us that our
life goes smoother when we calculate with machines." But must smoothness
necessarily be our ideal (must it be our ideal to have everything wrapped in
cellophane)?
Might I not even trust memory and not trust the machine? And might I not mistrust the
experience which 'gives me the illusion' that the machine is more trustworthy?
Page 213
82. Earlier I was not certain that, among the kinds of multiplication corresponding to
this description, there was none yielding a result different from the accepted one. But
say my uncertainty is such as only to arise at a certain distance from calculation of the
normal kind; and suppose that we said: there it does no harm; for if I calculate in a very
abnormal way, then I must just reconsider everything. Wouldn't this be all right?
Page 213
I want to ask: must a proof of consistency (or of non-ambiguity) necessarily give me
greater certainty than I have without it? And, if I am really out for adventures, may I
not go out for ones where this proof no longer offers me any certainty?
Page 213
My aim is to alter the attitude to contradiction and to consistency proofs. (Not to shew
that this proof shews something unimportant. How could that be so?)


Page Break 214
Page 214
If for example I were anxious to produce contradictions, say for aesthetic purposes,
then I should now unhesitatingly accept the inductive proof of consistency and say: it is
hopeless to try and produce a contradiction in this calculus; the proof shews that it
won't work. (Proof in theory of harmony.)----
Page 214
83. It is a good way of putting things to say: "this order (this method) is unknown to
this calculus, but not to that one".
What if one said: "A calculus to which this order is unknown is really not a calculus"?
(An office system to which this order is unknown is not really an office system.)
Page 214
It is--I should like to say--for practical, not for theoretical purposes, that the disorder is
avoided.

Page 215
What sort of proposition is it, that only then can you rely on the calculus? But what if
you do rely on it without that proof! What sort of mistake have you made?
Page 215
I introduce order; I say: "There are only these possibilities: ...". It is like determining
the set of possible permutations of A, B, C: before the order was there, I had perhaps
only a foggy idea of this set.--Am I now quite certain that I have overlooked nothing?
The order is a method for not overlooking anything. But--for not overlooking any
possibility in the calculus, or: for not overlooking any possibility in reality?--Is it now
certain that people will never want to calculate differently? That people will never look
at our calculus as we look at the counting of aborigines whose numbers only go up to
5?--that we shall never want to look at reality differently? But that is not at all the
certainty that this order is supposed to give us. It is not the eternal correctness of the
calculus that is supposed to be assured, but only, so to speak, the temporal.
Page 215
'But these are the possibilities that you mean!--Or do you mean other ones?'
Page 215
The order convinces me that I have overlooked nothing when I have these 6
possibilities. But does it also convince me that nothing is going to be able to upset my
present conception of such possibilities?

85. Could I imagine our fearing a possibility of constructing the heptagon, like the
construction of a contradiction; and that the proof that the construction of the heptagon
is impossible should have a settling effect, like a consistency proof?
Page 216
How does it come about that we are at all tempted (or at any rate come near it) to divide
through by (3 - 3) in (3 - 3)  2 = (3 - 3)  5? How does it come about that by the


                                            146
rules this step looks plausible, and that even so it is still unusable?
When one tries to describe this situation it is enormously easy to make a mistake in the
description. (So it is very difficult to describe.) The descriptions which immediately
suggest themselves are all misleading--that is how our language in this field is
arranged.
Page 216
And there will be constant lapses from description into explanation here.
Page 216
It was, or appears to be, roughly like this: we have a calculus, let us say, with the beads
of an abacus; we then replace it by a calculus with written signs; this calculus suggests
to us an extension of the method of calculating which the first calculus did not
suggest--or perhaps better: the second calculus obliterates a distinction which was not
to be overlooked in the first one. Now if it was the point of the first calculus that this
distinction was made, and it is not made in the second one then the latter thereby lost its
usability as an equivalent of the former. And now--it seems--the problem might arise:
where did we depart from the original calculus, what frontiers in the new one
correspond to the natural frontiers of the old?


Page Break 217
Page 217
I formed a system of rules of calculation which were modelled on those of another
calculus. I took the latter as a model. But exceeded its limits. This was even an
advantage; but now the new calculus became unusable in certain parts (at least for the
former purposes). I therefore seek to alter it: that is, to replace it by one that is to some
extent different. And by one that has the advantages without the disadvantages of the
new one. But is that a clearly defined task?
Is there such a thing--it might also be asked--as the right logical calculus, only without
the contradictions?
Could it be said, e.g., that while Russell's Theory of Types avoids the contradiction, still
Russell's calculus is not THE universal logical calculus but perhaps an artificially
restricted, mutilated one? Could it be said that the pure, universal logical calculus has
yet to be found?
I was playing a game and in doing so I followed certain rules: but as for how I followed
them, that depended on circumstances and the way it so depended was not laid down in
black and white. (This is to some extent a misleading account.) Now I wanted to play
this game in such a way as to follow rules 'mechanically' and I 'formalized' the game.
But in doing this I reached positions where the game lost all point; I therefore wanted
to avoid these positions 'mechanically'.--The formalization of logic did not work out
satisfactorily. But what was the attempt made for at all? (What was it useful for?) Did
not this need, and the idea that it must be capable of satisfaction, arise from a lack of
clarity in another place?
Page 217
The question "what was it useful for?" was a quite essential question. For the calculus
was not invented for some practical purpose, but in order 'to give arithmetic a
foundation'. But who says that arithmetic is logic, or what has to be done with logic to
make it in some sense into a substructure for arithmetic? If we had e.g. been led to

                                             147
attempt this


Page Break 218
by aesthetic considerations, who says that it can succeed? (Who says that this English
poem can be translated into German to our satisfaction?!)
(Even if it is clear that there is in some sense a translation of any English sentence into
German.)
Page 218
Philosophical dissatisfaction disappears by our seeing more.
By my allowing the cancelling of (3 - 3) this type of calculation loses its point. But
suppose that, for example, I were to introduce a new sign of equality which was
supposed to express: 'equal after this operation'? Would it, however, make sense to say:
"Won in this sense", if in this sense I should win every game?
Page 218
At certain places the calculus led me to its own abrogation. Now I want a calculus that
does not do this and that excludes these places.--Does this mean, however, that any
calculus in which such an exclusion does not occur is an uncertain one? "Well, the
discovery of these places was a warning to us."--But did you not misunderstand this
'warning'?
Page 218
86. Can one prove that one has not overlooked anything?--Certainly. And must one not
perhaps admit later: "Yes, I did overlook something; but not in the field for which my
proof held"?
Page 218
The proof of consistency must give us reasons for a prediction; and


Page Break 219
that is its practical purpose. That does not mean that this proof is a proof from the
physics of our technique of calculation--and so a proof from applied mathematics--but
it does mean that that prediction is the application that first suggests itself to us, and the
one for whose sake we have this proof at heart. The prediction is not: "No disorder will
arise in this way" (for that would not be a prediction: it is the mathematical proposition)
but: "no disorder will arise".
Page 219
I wanted to say: the consistency-proof can only set our minds at rest, if it is a cogent
reason for this prediction.
Page 219
87. Where it is enough for me to get a proof that a contradiction or a trisection of the
angle cannot be constructed in this way, the recursive proof achieves what is required
of it. But if I had to fear that something somehow might at some time be interpreted as

                                             148
the construction of a contradiction, then no proof can take this indefinite fear from me.
Page 219
The fence that I put round contradiction is not a super-fence.
How can a proof have put the calculus right in principle?
Page 219
How can it have failed to be a proper calculus until this proof was found?

"This calculus is purely mechanical; a machine could carry it out." What sort of
machine? One constructed of the usual materials--or a super-machine? Are you not
confusing the hardness of a rule with the hardness of a material?
Page 220
We shall see contradiction in a quite different light if we look at its occurrence and its
consequences as it were anthropologically--and when we look at it with a
mathematician's exasperation. That is to say, we shall look at it differently, if we try
merely to describe how the contradiction influences language-games, and if we look at
it from the point of view of the mathematical law-giver.
Page 220
88. But wait--isn't it clear that no one wants to reach a contradiction? And so that if you
shew someone the possibility of a contradiction, he will do everything to make such a
thing impossible? (And so that if someone does not do this, he is a sleepyhead.)
Page 220
But suppose he replied: "I can't imagine a contradiction in my

calculus.--You have indeed shewn me a contradiction in another, but not in this one. In
this there is none, nor can I see the possibility of one."

"If my conception of the calculus should sometime alter; if its aspect should alter
because of some context that I cannot see now--then we'll talk some more about it."
"I do not see the possibility of a contradiction. Any more than you--as it seems--see the
possibility of there being one in your consistency-proof."

Do I know whether, if I ever should see a contradiction where at present I can see no
possibility of such a thing, it will then look dangerous to me?

1. "The axioms of a mathematical axiom-system ought to be self-evident." How are
they self-evident, then?
What if I were to say: this is how I find it easiest to imagine.
And here imagining is not a particular mental process during which one usually shuts
one's eyes or covers them with one's hands.
Page 223
2. What do we say when we are presented with such an axiom, e.g. the parallel axiom?
Has experience shewn us that this is how it is? Well perhaps; but what experience? I
mean: experience plays a part; but not the one that one would immediately expect. For
we haven't made experiments and found that in reality only one straight line through a
given point fails to cut another. And yet the proposition is evident.--Suppose I now say:
it is quite indifferent why it is evident. It is enough that we accept it. All that is
important is how we use it.
Page 223
The proposition describes a picture. Namely:




                                            150
We find this picture acceptable. As we find it acceptable to indicate our rough
knowledge of a number by rounding it off at a multiple of 10.


Page Break 224
Page 224
'We accept this proposition.' But as what do we accept it?
Page 224
3. I want to say: when the words of e.g. the parallel-axiom are given (and we
understand the language) the kind of use this proposition has and hence its sense are as
yet quite undetermined. And when we say that it is evident, this means that we have
already chosen a definite kind of employment for the proposition without realizing it.
The proposition is not a mathematical axiom if we do not employ it precisely for this
purpose.
Page 224
The fact, that is, that here we do not make experiments, but accept the self-evidence, is
enough to fix the employment. For we are not so naïf as to make the self-evidence
count in place of experiment.
Page 224
It is not our finding the proposition self-evidently true, but our making the
self-evidence count, that makes it into a mathematical proposition.
Page 224
4. Does experience tell us that a straight line is possible between any two points? Or
that two different colours cannot be at the same place?
It might be said: imagination tells us it. And the germ of truth is here; only one must
understand it right.
Page 224
Before the proposition the concept is still pliable.


Page Break 225
Page 225
But might not experience determine us to reject the axiom?! Yes. And nevertheless it
does not play the part of an empirical proposition.
Page 225
Why are the Newtonian laws not axioms of mathematics? Because we could quite well
imagine things being otherwise. But--I want to say--this only assigns a certain role to
those propositions in contrast to another one. I.e.: to say of a proposition: 'This could be
imagined otherwise' or 'We can imagine the opposite too', ascribes the role of an
empirical proposition to it.

Page 225
A proposition which it is supposed to be impossible to imagine as other than true has a
different function from one for which this does not hold.
Page 225
5. The functioning of the axioms of mathematics is such that, if experience moved us to
give up an axiom, that would not make its opposite into an axiom.


           '2  2  5' does not mean:

           '2  2 = 5' has not worked.

Page 225
One might, so to speak, preface axioms with a special assertion sign.
Page 225
Something is an axiom, not because we accept it as extremely probable, nay certain, but
because we assign it a particular function, and


Page Break 226
one that conflicts with that of an empirical proposition.
Page 226
We give an axiom a different kind of acknowledgment from an empirical proposition.
And by this I do not mean that the 'mental act of acknowledgment' is a different one.
Page 226
An axiom, I should like to say, is a different part of speech.
Page 226
6. When one hears the mathematical axiom that such and such is possible, one assumes
offhand that one knows what 'being possible' means here; because this form of sentence
is naturally familiar to us.
Page 226
We are not made aware how various the employment of the assertion "... is possible" is!
And that is why it does not occur to us to ask about the special employment in this case.
Page 226
Lacking the slightest survey of the whole use, we are here quite unable to doubt that we
understand the proposition.
Page 226
Does the proposition that there is no such thing as action at a distance belong to the


                                            152
family of mathematical propositions? Here again one would like to say: the proposition
is not designed to express any experience, but rather to express the impossibility of
imagining anything different.


Page Break 227
Page 227
To say that between two points a straight line is--geometrically--always possible
means: the proposition "The points... lie on a straight line" is an assertion about the
position of the points only if more than 2 points are involved.
Page 227
Just as one does not ask oneself, either, what is the meaning of a proposition of the
form "There is no..." (e.g. "there is no proof of this proposition") in a particular case.
Asked what it means, one replies both to someone else and to oneself with an example
of nonexistence.
Page 227
7. A mathematical proposition stands on four feet, not on three; it is over-determined.
Page 227
8. When we describe what a man does, e.g., by means of a rule, we want the person to
whom we give the description to know, by applying the rule, what happens in the
particular case. Now do I give him an indirect description by means of the rule?
Page 227
There is of course such a thing as a proposition saying: if anyone tries to multiply the
numbers... according to such and such rules, he gets....

One application of a mathematical proposition must always be the calculating itself.
That determines the relation of the activity of calculating to the sense of mathematical

We judge identity and agreement by the results of our calculating; that is why we

We describe by means of the rule. What for? Why? That is another question.
Page 228
'The rule, applied to these numbers, yields those' might mean: the expression of the

One feels, quite rightly, that that would not be a mathematical proposition.

The mathematical proposition determines a path, lays down a path for us.
Page 228
It is no contradiction of this that it is a rule, and not simply stipulated but produced
according to rules.
Page 228
If you use a rule to give a description, you yourself do not know more than you say. I.e.

9. How could one explain to anybody what you have to do if you are to follow a rule?
Page 229
One is tempted to explain: first and foremost do the simplest thing (if the rule e.g. is
always to repeat the same thing). And there is of course something in this. It is
significant that we can say that it is simpler to write down a sequence of numbers in
which each number is the same as its predecessor than a sequence in which each
number is greater by 1 than its predecessor. And again that this is a simpler law than
that of alternately adding 1 and 2.
Page 229
10. Isn't it over-hasty to apply a proposition that one has tested on sticks and stones, to
wavelengths of light? I mean: that 2  5000 = 10,000.
Does one actually count on it that what has proved true in so many cases must hold for
these too? Or is it not rather that with the arithmetical assumption we have not
committed ourselves at all?
Page 229
11. Arithmetic as the natural history (mineralogy) of numbers. But who talks like this
about it? Our whole thinking is penetrated with this idea.
Page 229
The numbers (I don't mean the numerals) are shapes, and arithmetic tells us the
properties of these shapes. But the difficulty here is that these properties of the shapes
are possibilities, not the properties in respect to shape of the things of this shape. And
these possibilities in turn emerge as physical, or psychological possibilities (of
separation, arrangement, etc.). But the role of the shapes is merely that of pictures



                                             154
Page Break 230
which are used in such-and-such a way. What we give is not properties of shapes, but
transformations of shapes, set up as paradigms of some kind or other.

We do not investigate them, we use them to investigate something else.

You get him to decide on accepting this picture. And you do so by means of the proof,
i.e. by exhibiting a series of pictures, or simply by shewing him the picture. What
moves him to decide does not matter here. The main thing is that it is a question of
accepting a picture.
Page 230
The picture of combining is not a combining; the picture of separating is not a
separating; the picture of something's fitting not a case of fitting. And yet these pictures
are of the greatest significance. That is what it is like, if a combination is made; if a
separation; and so on.
Page 230
13. What would it be for animals or crystals to have as beautiful properties as numbers?
There would then be e.g. a series of forms, each bigger than another by a unit.
Page 230
I should like to be able to describe how it comes about that mathematics appears to us
now as the natural history of the domain of numbers, now again as a collection of rules.


Page Break 231
Page 231
But could one not study transformations of (e.g.) the forms of animals? But how
'study'? I mean: might it not be useful to pass transformations of animal shapes in
review? And yet this would not be a branch of zoology.
Page 231
It would then be a mathematical proposition (e.g.), that this shape is derived from this
one by way of this transformation. (The shapes and transformations being
recognizable.)
Page 231
14. We must remember, however, that by its transformations a mathematical proof
proves not only propositions of sign-geometry, but propositions of the most various
content.
In this way the transformation in a Russellian proof proves that this logical proposition
can be formed from the fundamental laws by the use of these rules. But the proof is
looked at as a proof of the truth of the conclusion, or as a proof that the conclusion says

                                            155
nothing.
Now this is possible only through a relation of the proposition to something outside
itself; I mean, e.g., through its relation to other propositions and to their application.
Page 231
"A tautology (e.g. 'p~p') says nothing" is a proposition referring to the
language-game in which the proposition p has application. (E.g. "It is raining or it is not
raining" tells us nothing about the weather.)
Page 231
Russellian logic says nothing about kinds of propositions--I don't mean logical
propositions--and their employment: and yet logic gets its whole sense simply from its
presumed application to propositions.

15. People can be imagined to have an applied mathematics without any pure
mathematics. They can e.g.--let us suppose--calculate the path described by certain
moving bodies and predict their place at a given time. For this purpose they make use
of a system of co-ordinates, of the equations of curves (a form of description of actual
movement) and of the technique of calculating in the decimal system. The idea of a
proposition of pure mathematics may be quite foreign to them.
Thus these people have rules in accordance with which they transform the appropriate
signs (in particular, e.g., numerals) with a view to predicting the occurrence of certain
events.
Page 232
But when they now multiply, for example, will they not arrive at a proposition saying
that the result of the multiplication is the same, however the factors are shifted round?
That will not be a primary rule of notation, nor yet a proposition of their physics.
They do not need to obtain any such proposition--even if they allow the shift of factors.
Page 232
I am imagining the matter as if this mathematics were done entirely in the form of
orders. "You must do such-and-such"--so as to get the answer, that is, to the question
'where will this body be at such-and-such a time?' (It does not matter at all how these
people have arrived at this method of prediction.)
Page 232

law (e.g.) to be a proposition?
Page 233
But I want to say: these people are not supposed to arrive at the conception of making
mathematical discoveries--but only of making physical discoveries.
Page 233
Question: Must they make mathematical discoveries as discoveries? What do they miss
if they make none? Could they (for example) use the proof of the commutative law, but
without the conception of its culminating in a proposition, and so having a result which
is in some way comparable with their physical propositions?
Page 233
17. The mere picture




regarded now as four rows of five dots, now as five columns of four dots, might
convince someone of the commutative law. And he might thereupon carry out
multiplications, now in the one direction, now in the other.

"Yes, but only if the pieces don't change."--If they don't change, and we don't make
some unintelligible mistake, or pieces disappear or get added without our noticing it.

shape! What would happen if they could not?"--Perhaps we should think that

                                            157
something had put us out. But--what then?--Perhaps we should even accept the thing as
it was. And then Frege might say: "Here we have a new kind of insanity!"†1
Page 234
18. It is clear that mathematics as a technique for transforming signs for the purpose of
prediction has nothing to do with grammar.
Page 234
19. The people whose mathematics was only such a technique, are now also supposed
to accept proofs convincing them of the replaceability of one sign-technique by another.
That is to say, they find transformations, series of pictures, on the strength of which
they can venture to use one technique in place of another.

20. If calculating looks to us like the action of a machine, it is the human being doing

21. And that brings me to the fact that a picture may very well convince us that a
particular part of a mechanism will move in such-and-such a way when the mechanism
is set in motion.
Page 235
The effect of such a picture (or series of pictures) is like that of a proof. In this way I
might e.g. make a construction for how the point X of the mechanism




will move.

24. True;--it looks as though, if our memory functioned differently, we could not
calculate as we do. But in that case could we give definitions as we do; talk and write
as we do?
But how can we describe the foundation of our language by means of empirical
propositions?
Page 236
25. Suppose that when we worked out a division it did not lead to the same result as the
copying of its period. That might arise e.g. from our altering our tables, without being
aware of it. (Though it might also arise from our copying in a different way.)

27. Pay attention to the patter by means of which we convince someone of the truth of a
mathematical proposition. It tells us something about the function of this conviction. I
mean the patter by which intuition is awakened.
By which, that is, the machine of a calculating technique is set in motion.
Page 237
28. Can it be said that if you learn a technique, that convinces you of the uniformity of
its results?
Page 237
29. The limit of the empirical†1--is concept-formation.
Page 237
What is the transition that I make from "It will be like this" to "it must be like this"? I
form a different concept. One involving something that was not there before. When I
say: "If these derivations are the same, then it must be that...", I am making something
into a criterion of identity. So I am recasting my concept of identity.
Page 237
But what if someone now says: "I am not aware of these two processes, I am only
aware of the empirical, not of a formation and transformation of concepts which is
independent of it; everything seems to me to be in the service of the empirical"?
In other words: we do not seem to become now more, now less, rational, or to alter the
form of our thinking, so as to alter what we call "thinking". We only seem always to be
fitting our thinking to experience.



Page Break 238
Page 238
So much is clear: when someone says: "If you follow the rule, it must be like this", he
has not any clear concept of what experience would correspond to the opposite.
Page 238
Or again: he has not any clear concept of what it would be like for it to be otherwise.
And this is very important.
Page 238
30. What compels us so to form the concept of identity as to say, e.g., "If you really do
the same thing both times, then the result must be the same too"?--What compels us to
proceed according to a rule, to conceive something as a rule? What compels us to talk
to ourselves in the forms of the languages we have learnt?
Page 238
For the word "must" surely expresses our inability to depart from this concept. (Or

                                            160
ought I to say "refusal"?)
Page 238
And even if I have made the transition from one concept-formation to another, the old
concept is still there in the background.
Page 238
Can I say: "A proof induces us to make a certain decision, namely that of accepting a
particular concept-formation"?
Page 238
Do not look at the proof as a procedure that compels you, but as one


Page Break 239
that guides you.--And what it guides is your conception of a (particular) situation.
Page 239
But how does it come about that it guides each one of us in such a way that we agree in
the influence it has on us? Well, how does it come about that we agree in counting?
"That is just how we are trained" one may say, "and the agreement produced in this way
is carried further by the proofs."
Page 239
In the course of this proof we formed our way of looking at the trisection of the angle,
which excludes a construction with ruler and compass.
Page 239
By accepting a proposition as self evident, we also release it from all responsibility in
face of experience.
Page 239
In the course of the proof our way of seeing is changed--and it does not detract from
this that it is connected with experience.
Page 239
Our way of seeing is remodelled.
Page 239

The proof as it were guides our experience into definite channels. Someone who has
tried again and again to do such-and-such gives the attempt up after the proof.
Page 240
Someone tries to arrange pieces to make a particular pattern. Now he sees a model in
which one part of that pattern is seen to be composed of all his pieces, and he gives up
his attempt. The model was the proof that his proposal is impossible.
Page 240
That model too, like the one that shews that he will be able to make a pattern of these
pieces, changes his concept. For, one might say, he never looked at the task of making
the pattern of these pieces in this way before.
Page 240
Is it obvious that if anyone sees that part of the pattern can be made with these pieces,
he realizes that there is no way of making the whole pattern with them? May it not be
that he goes on trying and trying whether after all some arrangement of the pieces does
not achieve this end? And may he not achieve it? (Use of one piece twice over, e.g.)

of a truth or of a falsehood. I am asking: what is the characteristic demeanour of human
beings who 'have insight into' something 'immediately', whatever the practical result of
this insight is?
Page 241
What interests me is not having immediate insight into a truth, but the phenomenon of
immediate insight. Not indeed as a special mental phenomenon, but as one of human

33. Yes: it is as if the formation of a concept guided our experience into particular

I did not know how it would go,--but I saw a picture and became convinced that it
would go as it does in the picture.
The picture helped me to make a prediction. Not as an experiment--it was only midwife
to the prediction.



Page Break 242
Page 242
For, whatever my experience is or has been, I surely still have to make the prediction.
(Experience does not make it for me.)
Page 242
No great wonder, then, that proof helps us to predict. Without this picture I should not
have been able to say how it will be, but when I see it I seize on it with a view to
prediction.
Page 242
I cannot predict the colour of a chemical compound by means of a picture exhibiting
the substances in the test-tube and the reaction. If the picture shewed frothing, and
finally red crystals, I should not be able to say: "Yes, that is how it has to be" or "No, it
cannot be like that". It is otherwise, however, when I see the picture of a mechanism in
motion; that can tell me how a part actually will move. Though if the picture
represented a mechanism whose parts were composed of a very soft material (dough,
say), and hence bent about in various ways in the picture, then this picture might not
help me to make a prediction either.
Page 242
Can we say that a concept is so formed as to be adapted to a certain prediction, i.e. it
enables it to be made in the simplest terms--?

By being educated in a technique, we are also educated to have a way of looking at the
matter which is just as firmly rooted as that technique.
Page 243
Mathematical propositions seem to treat neither of signs nor of human beings, and
therefore they do not.
Page 243
They shew those connexions that we regard as rigid. But to a certain extent we look
away from these connexions and at something else. We turn our back upon them, so to
speak. Or: we rest, or lean, on them.
Page 243
Once more: we do not look at the mathematical proposition as a proposition dealing
with signs, and hence it is not that.
Page 243
We acknowledge it by turning our back on it.

way of looking at things, and so in our way of living and acting.
Page 244
Is not the proof too flimsy a reason for entirely giving up the search for a construction
of the trisection? You have only gone through the sequence of signs once or twice; will
you decide on the strength of that? Just because you have seen this one transformation,
will you give up the search?
Page 244
The effect of proof is, I believe, that we plunge into the new rule.
Page 244
Hitherto we have calculated according to such and such a rule; now someone shews us
the proof that it can also be done in another way, and we switch to the other
technique--not because we tell ourselves that it will work this way too, but because we
feel the new technique as identical with the old one, because we have to give it the
same sense, because we recognize it as the same just as we recognize this colour as
green.
That is to say: insight into mathematical relations has a role similar to that of seeing an
identity. It might almost be said to be a more complicated kind of identity.

The last but one is the most like an empirical proposition. And it can understandably be

43. It might perhaps be said that the synthetic character of the propositions of
mathematics appears most obviously in the unpredictable occurrence of the prime
numbers.
Page 246
But their being synthetic (in this sense) does not make them any the less a priori. They
could be said, I want to say, not to be got out of their concepts by means of some kind
of analysis, but really to determine a concept by synthesis, e.g. as crossing prisms can
be made to determine a body.
Page 246
The distribution of primes would be an ideal example of what could be called synthetic
a priori, for one can say that it is at any rate not discoverable by an analysis of the

44. Might one not really talk of intuition in mathematics? Though it would not be a
mathematical truth that was grasped intuitively, but a physical or psychological one. In
this way I know with great certainty that if I multiply 25 by 25 ten times I shall get 625
every time. That is to say I know the psychological fact that this calculation will keep
on seeming correct to me; as I know that if I write down the series of numbers from 1
to 20 ten times my lists will prove identical on collation.--Now is that an empirical
fact? Of course--and yet it would be difficult to mention experiments that would
convince me of it. Such a thing might be called an intuitively known empirical fact.

No, that is not enough. We are convinced that the same calculation will always come

the same that was calculated, we could not conclude that the calculation yields at one
time one result and at another time another.

But could I draw the movement of the mechanism in other ways too, if its parts do not
alter? That is to say, am I not compelled, under these conditions, to accept just this as
the picture of the movement?

Let us imagine the construction of the phases of the mechanism carried out with lines

What if it were said: If you reverse the sequence 1 2 3, you learn about it that it yields 3
2 1 when reversed? And what you learn is not a property of these ink-marks, but of the
sequence of forms. You learn a formal property of forms. The proposition asserting this
formal property is proved by experience, which shews you the one form arising in this
way out of the other.

Now, if you learn this, do you have two impressions? One of the fact that the sequence
is reversed, the other of the fact that 3 2 1 arises? And could you not have the

Perhaps it will be said: "Only by a queer illusion".--

The reason why one really cannot say that one learns that formal proposition from
experience is--that one only calls it this experience when this process leads to this
result. The experience meant consists as such of this process with this result.
Page 251
That is why it is more than the experience: seeing a pattern.
Page 251
Can one row of letters have two reverses?
Say one acoustic, and another, optical, reverse. Suppose I explain to someone what the
reverse of a word on paper is, what we call that. And now it turns out that he has an
acoustic reverse of the word, i.e., something that he would like to call that, but it does
not quite agree with the written reverse. So that one can say: he hears this as the reverse
of the word. As if, as it were, the word got distorted for him in being turned round. And
this might perhaps occur if he pronounced the word and its reverse fluently, as opposed
to the case of spelling it out. Or the reverse might seem different when he spoke the
word forwards and backwards in a single utterance.
Page 251
It might be that the exact mirror-image of a profile, seen immediately


Page Break 252
after it, was never pronounced to be the same thing, merely turned in the other
direction; but that in order to give the impression of exact reversal, the profile had to be
altered a little in its measurements.
Page 252
But I want to say that we have no right to say: though we may indeed be in doubt about
the correct reverse of, for example, a long word, still we know that the word has only
one reverse.

                                            169
"Yes, but if it is supposed to be a reverse in this sense there can be only one." Does 'in
this sense' here mean: by these rules, or: with this physiognomy? In the first case the
proposition would be tautological, in the second it need not be true.
Page 252
51. Think of a machine which 'is so constructed' that it reverses a row of letters. And
now of the proposition that in the case of


           OVER

the result is


           R E V O.--

Page 252
The rule, as it is actually meant, seems to be a driving power which reverses an ideal
sequence like this,--whatever a human being may do with an actual sequence.
This is the mechanism which is the yardstick, the ideal, for the actual mechanism.


Page Break 253
Page 253
And that is intelligible. For if the result of the reversal becomes the criterion for the
row's really having been reversed, and if we express this as our imitating an ideal
machine, then this machine must produce this result infallibly.
Page 253
52. Now can it be said that the concepts which mathematics produces are a
convenience, that essentially we could do without them?
Page 253
First and foremost the adoption of these concepts expresses the sure expectation of
certain experiences.
Page 253
We do not accept e.g. a multiplication's not yielding the same result every time.
Page 253
And what we expect with certainty is essential to our whole life.
Page 253
53. Why, then, should I not say that mathematical propositions just express those
special expectations, i.e., therefore, that they express matters of experience? Only
because they just do not. Perhaps I should not take the measure of adopting a certain
concept if I did not quite definitely expect the occurrence of certain facts; but for that

                                             170
reason laying down this measure and expressing the expectations are not equivalent.

54. It is difficult to put the body of fact right side up: to regard the given as given. It is
difficult to place the body differently from the way one is accustomed to see it. A table
in a lumber room may always lie upside down, in order to save space perhaps. Thus I
have always seen the body of fact placed like this, for reasons of various kinds; and
now I am supposed to see something else as its beginning and something else as its end.
That is difficult. It as it were will not stand like that, unless one supports it in this
position by means of other contrivances.
Page 254
55. It is one thing to use a mathematical technique consisting in the avoidance of
contradiction, and another to philosophize against contradiction in mathematics.
Page 254
56. Contradiction. Why just this one bogy? That is surely very suspicious.
Page 254
Why should not a calculation made for a practical purpose, with a contradictory result,
tell me: "Do as you please, I, the calculation, do not decide the matter"?
Page 254
The contradiction might be conceived as a hint from the gods that I am to act and not
consider.
Page 254
57. "Why should contradiction be disallowed in mathematics?" Well, why is it not
allowed in our simple language-games? (There is


Page Break 255
certainly a connexion here.) Is this then a fundamental law governing all thinkable
language-games?
Page 255
Let us suppose that a contradiction in an order, e.g. produces astonishment and
indecision--and now we say: that is just the purpose of contradiction in this
language-game.
Page 255
58. Someone comes to people and says: "I always lie". They answer: "Well, in that case
we can trust you!"--But could he mean what he said? Is there not a feeling of being
incapable of saying something really true; let it be what it may?--
Page 255

                                             171
"I always lie!"--Well, and what about that?--"It was a lie too!"--But in that case you
don't always lie!--"No, it's all lies!"
Perhaps we should say of this man that he doesn't mean the same thing as we do by
"true" and by "lying". He means perhaps something like: What he says flickers; or
nothing really comes from his heart.
Page 255
It might also be said: his "I always lie" was not really an assertion. It was rather an
exclamation.
Page 255
And so it can be said: "If he was saying that sentence, not thoughtlessly--then he must
have meant the words in such-and-such a way, he cannot have meant them in the usual
way"?


Page Break 256
Page 256
59. Why should Russell's contradiction not be conceived as something supra-
propositional, something that towers above the propositions and looks in both
directions like a Janus head? N.B. the proposition F(F)--in which F(x) =
~x(x)--contains no variables and so might hold as something supra-logical, as
something unassailable, whose negation itself in turn only asserts it. Might one not
even begin logic with this contradiction? And as it were descend from it to
propositions.
Page 256
The proposition that contradicts itself would stand like a monument (with a Janus head)
over the propositions of logic.
Page 256
60. The pernicious thing is not: to produce a contradiction in the region in which
neither the consistent nor the contradictory proposition has any kind of work to
accomplish; no, what is pernicious is: not to know how one reached the place where
contradiction no longer does any harm.

1. It is of course clear that the mathematician, in so far as he really is 'playing a game'
does not infer. For here 'playing' must mean: acting in accordance with certain rules.
And it would already be something outside the mere game for him to infer that he could
act in this way according to the general rule.

2. Does a calculating machine calculate?
Page 257
Imagine that a calculating machine had come into existence by accident; now someone
accidentally presses its knobs (or an animal walks over it) and it calculates the product
25  20.
Page 257
I want to say: it is essential to mathematics that its signs are also employed in mufti.
It is the use outside mathematics, and so the meaning of the signs, that makes the
sign-game into mathematics.
Page 257
Just as it is not logical inference either, for me to make a change from one formation to
another (say from one arrangement of chairs to another) if these arrangements have not
a linguistic function apart from this transformation.
Page 257
3. But is it not true that someone with no idea of the meaning


Page Break 258
of Russell's symbols could work over Russell's proofs? And so could in an important
sense test whether they were right or wrong?
Page 258
A human calculating machine might be trained so that when the rules of inference were
shewn it and perhaps exemplified, it read through the proofs of a mathematical system
(say that of Russell), and nodded its head after every correctly drawn conclusion, but
shook its head at a mistake and stopped calculating. One could imagine this creature as
otherwise perfectly imbecile.
Page 258
We call a proof something that can be worked over, but can also be copied.
Page 258
4. If mathematics is a game, then playing some game is doing mathematics, and in that
case why isn't dancing mathematics too?
Page 258
Imagine that calculating machines occurred in nature, but that people could not pierce
their cases. And now suppose that these people use these appliances, say as we use
calculation, though of that they know nothing. Thus e.g. they make predictions with the
aid of calculating machines, but for them manipulating these queer objects is
experimenting.


                                            173
Page 258
These people lack concepts which we have; but what takes their place?


Page Break 259
Page 259
Think of the mechanism whose movement we saw as a geometrical (kinematic) proof
clearly it would not normally be said of someone turning the wheel that he was proving
something. Isn't it the same with someone who makes and changes arrangements of
signs as a game; even when what he produces could be seen as a proof?
Page 259
To say mathematics is a game is supposed to mean: in proving, we need never appeal to
the meaning of the signs, that is to their extra-mathematical application. But then what
does appealing to this mean at all? How can such an appeal be of any avail?
Page 259
Does it mean passing out of mathematics and returning to it again, or does it mean
passing from one method of mathematical inference to another?
Page 259
What does it mean to obtain a new concept of the surface of a sphere? How is it then a
concept of the surface of a sphere? Only in so far as it can be applied to real spheres.
Page 259
How far does one need to have a concept of 'proposition', in order to understand
Russellian mathematical logic?
Page 259
5. If the intended application of mathematics is essential, how about parts of
mathematics whose application--or at least what


Page Break 260
mathematicians take for their application--is quite fantastic? So that, as in set theory,
one is doing a branch of mathematics of whose application one forms an entirely false
idea. Now, isn't one doing mathematics none the less?
Page 260
If the operations of arithmetic only served to construct a cipher, its application would of
course be fundamentally different from that of our arithmetic. But would these
operations then be mathematical operations at all?
Page 260
Can someone who is applying a decoding rule be said to be performing mathematical
operations? And yet his transformations can be so conceived. For he could surely say
that he was calculating what had to come out in decoding the symbols... with

                                           174
such-and-such a key. And the proposition: the signs..., decoded according to this rule,
yield... is a mathematical one. As is the proposition that you can get to this position
from that one in chess.
Page 260
Imagine the geometry of four-dimensional space done with a view to learning about the
living conditions of spirits. Does that mean that it is not mathematics? And can I now
say that it determines concepts?
Page 260
Would it not sound queer to say that a child could already do thousands and thousands
of multiplications--by which is supposed to be meant that it can already calculate in the
unlimited number domain. And indeed this might be reckoned an extremely modest
way of putting it, as it says only 'thousands and thousands' instead of 'infinitely many'.


Page Break 261
Page 261
Could people be imagined, who in their ordinary lives only calculated up to 1000 and
kept calculations with higher numbers for mathematical investigations about the world
of spirits?
Page 261
"Whether or not this holds of the surface of a real sphere--it does hold for the
mathematical one"--this makes it look as if the special difference between the
mathematical and an empirical proposition was that, while the truth of the empirical
proposition is rough and oscillating, the mathematical proposition describes its object
precisely and absolutely. As if, in fact, the 'mathematical sphere' were a sphere. And it
might e.g. be asked whether there was only one such sphere, or several (a Fregean
question).
Page 261
Does a misunderstanding about the possible application constitute an objection to the
calculation as a part of mathematics?
Page 261
And apart from misunderstanding,--what about mere lack of clarity?
Page 261
Imagine someone who believes that mathematicians have discovered a queer thing,
                , which when squared does yield - 1, can't he nevertheless calculate
quite well with complex numbers, and apply such calculations in physics? And does
this make them any the less calculations?
In one respect of course his understanding has a weak foundation; but he will draw his
conclusions with certainty, and his calculus will have a solid foundation.

Now would it not be ridiculous to say this man wasn't doing mathematics?
Page 262
Someone makes an addition to mathematics, gives new definitions and discovers new
theorems--and in a certain respect he can be said not to know what he is doing.--He has
a vague imagination of having discovered something like a space (at which point he
thinks of a room), of having opened up a kingdom, and when asked about it he would
talk a great deal of nonsense.
Page 262
Let us imagine the primitive case of someone carrying out enormous multiplications in
order, as he says, to conquer gigantic new provinces of the domain of numbers.
Page 262


Imagine calculating with                   invented by a madman, who, attracted merely
by the paradox of the idea, does the calculation as a kind of service, or temple ritual, of
the absurd. He imagines that he is writing down the impossible and operating with it.
Page 262
In other words: if someone believes in mathematical objects and their queer
properties--can't he nevertheless do mathematics? Or--isn't he also doing mathematics?
Page 262
'Ideal object.' "The symbol 'a' stands for an ideal object" is evidently supposed to assert
something about the meaning, and so about the use, of 'a'. And it means of course that
this use is in a certain respect


Page Break 263
similar to that of a sign that has an object, and that it does not stand for any object. But
it is interesting what the expression 'ideal object' makes of this fact.
Page 263
6. In certain circumstances we might speak of an endless row of marbles.--Let us
imagine such an endless straight row of marbles at equal distances from one another;
we calculate the force exerted by all these marbles on a certain body according to a
certain law of attraction. We regard the number yielded by this calculation as the ideal
of exactness for certain measurements.
Page 263
The feeling of something queer here comes from a misunderstanding. The kind of
misunderstanding that is produced by a thumb-catching of the intellect--to which I want
to call a halt.
Page 263


                                             176
The objection that 'the finite cannot grasp the infinite' is really directed against the idea
of a psychological act of grasping or understanding.
Page 263
Or imagine that we simply say: "This force corresponds to the attraction of an endless
row of marbles which we have arranged in such-and-such a way and which attract the
body according to such-and-such a law of attraction". Or again: "Calculate the force
which an endless row of marbles of such-and-such a kind exerts on the body".--It
certainly makes sense to give such an order. It describes a particular calculation.

What about the following question: "Calculate the weight of a pillar composed of as
many slabs lying on top of one another as there are cardinal numbers; the undermost
slab weighs 1 kg., and every higher one weighs half of the one just below it".
Page 264
The difficulty is not that we can't form an image. It is easy enough to form some kind
of image of an endless row, for example. The question is what use the image is to us.
Page 264
Imagine infinite numbers used in a fairy tale. The dwarves have piled up as many gold
pieces as there are cardinal numbers--etc. What can occur in this fairy tale must surely

7. Imagine set theory's having been invented by a satirist as a kind of parody on
mathematics.--Later a reasonable meaning was seen in it and it was incorporated into
mathematics. (For if one person†1 can see it as a paradise of mathematicians, why
should not another see it as a joke?)
Page 264
The question is: even as a joke isn't it evidently mathematics?--



Page Break 265
Page 265
And why is it evidently mathematics?--Because it is a game with signs according to
rules?
Page 265
But isn't it evident that there are concepts formed here--even if we are not clear about
their application?
But how is it possible to have a concept and not be clear about its application?

8. Take the construction of the polygon of forces: isn't that a bit of applied
mathematics? And where is the proposition of pure mathematics which is invoked in
connexion with this graphical calculation? Is this case not like that of the tribe which
has a technique of calculating in order to make certain predictions, but no propositions
of pure mathematics?
Page 265
Calculation that belongs to the performance of a ceremony. For example, let the
number of words in a form of blessing that is to be applied to a home be derived by a
particular technique from the ages of the father and mother and the number of their
children. We could imagine procedures of calculating described in such a law as the
Mosaic law. And couldn't we imagine that the nation with these ceremonial
prescriptions for calculating never calculated in practical life?
Page 265
This would indeed be a case of applied calculation, but it would not serve the purpose
of a prediction.

Page 266
Would it be any wonder if the technique of calculating had a family of applications?
Page 266
9. We only see how queer the question is whether the pattern f (a particular
arrangement of digits e.g. '770') will occur in the infinite expansion of p, when we try
to formulate the question in a quite common or garden way: men have been trained to
put down signs according to certain rules. Now they proceed according to this training
and we say that it is a problem whether they will ever write down the pattern f in
following the given rule.
Page 266
But what are you saying if you say that one thing is clear: either one will come on f in
the infinite expansion, or one will not?
Page 266
It seems to me that in saying this you are yourself setting up a rule or postulate.
Page 266
What if someone were to reply to a question: 'So far there is no such thing as an answer
to this question'?
Page 266
So, e.g., the poet might reply when asked whether the hero of his poem has a sister or
not--when, that is, he has not yet decided anything about it.
Page 266


                                            178
The question--I want to say--changes its status, when it becomes


Page Break 267
decidable. For a connexion is made then, which formerly was not there.
Page 267
Of someone who is trained we can ask 'How will he interpret the rule for this case?', or
again 'How ought he to interpret the rule for this case?'--but what if no decision about
this question has been made?--Well, then the answer is, not: 'he ought to interpret it in
such a way that f occurs in the expansion' or: 'he ought to interpret it in such a way that
it does not occur', but: 'nothing has so far been decided about this'.
Page 267
However queer it sounds, the further expansion of an irrational number is a further
expansion of mathematics.
Page 267
We do mathematics with concepts.--And with certain concepts more than with other
ones.
Page 267
I want to say: it looks as if a ground for the decision were already there; and it has yet
to be invented.
Page 267
Would this come to the same thing as saying: in thinking about the technique of
expansion, which we have learnt, we use the false picture of a completed expansion (of
what is ordinarily called a "row") and this forces us to ask unanswerable questions?


Page Break 268
Page 268

For after all in the end every question about the expansion of         must be capable
of formulation as a practical question concerning the technique of expansion.
Page 268
And what is in question here is of course not merely the case of the expansion of a real
number, or in general the production of mathematical signs, but every analogous
process, whether it is a game, a dance, etc., etc..
Page 268
10. When someone hammers away at us with the law of excluded middle as something
which cannot be gainsaid, it is clear that there is something wrong with his question.
Page 268


                                            179
When someone sets up the law of excluded middle, he is as it were putting two pictures
before us to choose from, and saying that one must correspond to the fact. But what if it
is questionable whether the pictures can be applied here?
Page 268
And if you say that the infinite expansion must contain the pattern f or not contain it,
you are so to speak shewing us the picture of an unsurveyable series reaching into the
distance.
Page 268
But what if the picture began to flicker in the far distance?
Page 268
11. To say of an unending series that it does not contain a particular


Page Break 269
pattern makes sense only under quite special conditions.
Page 269
That is to say: this proposition has been given a sense for certain cases.
Page 269
Roughly, for those where it is in the rule for this series, not to contain the pattern....
Further: when I calculate the expansion further, I am deriving new rules which the
series obeys.
Page 269
"Good,--then we can say: 'It must either reside in the rule for this series that the pattern
occurs, or the opposite'." But is it like that?--"Well, doesn't the rule of expansion
determine the series completely? And if it does so, if it allows of no ambiguity, then it
must implicitly determine all questions about the structure of the series."--Here you are
thinking of finite series.
Page 269

"But surely all members of the series from the 1st up to 1,000th, up to the 1010-th and
so on, are determined; so surely all the members are determined." That is correct if it is
supposed to mean that it is not the case that e.g. the so-and-so-many'th is not
determined. But you can see that that gives you no information about whether a
particular pattern is going to appear in the series (if it has not appeared so far). And so
we can see that we are using a misleading picture.


Page Break 270
Page 270
If you want to know more about the series, you have, so to speak, to get into another

                                             180
dimension (as it were from the line into a surrounding plane).--But then isn't the plane
there, just like the line, and merely something to be explored, if one wants to know
what the facts are?
No, the mathematics of this further dimension has to be invented just as much as any
mathematics.
Page 270
In an arithmetic in which one does not count further than 5 the question what 4 + 3
makes doesn't yet make sense. On the other hand the problem may very well exist of
giving this question a sense. That is to say: the question makes no more sense than does
the law of excluded middle in application to it.
Page 270
12. In the law of excluded middle we think that we have already got something solid,
something that at any rate cannot be called in doubt. Whereas in truth this tautology has
just as shaky a sense (if I may put it like that), as the question whether p or ~ p is the
case.
Page 270
Suppose I were to ask: what is meant by saying "the pattern... occurs in this
expansion"? The reply would be: "you surely know what it means. It occurs as the
pattern... in fact occurs in the expansion."--So that is the way it occurs?--But what way
is that?
Imagine it were said: "Either it occurs in that way, or it does not occur in that way"!
Page 270
"But don't you really understand what is meant?"--But may I not believe I understand
it, and be wrong?--


Page Break 271
Page 271
For how do I know what it means to say: the pattern... occurs in the expansion? Surely
by way of examples--which shew me what it is like for.... But these examples do not
shew me what it is like for this pattern to occur in the expansion!
Page 271
Might one not say: if I really had a right to say that these examples tell me what it is
like for the pattern to occur in the expansion, then they would also have to shew me
what the opposite means.
Page 271
13. The general proposition that that pattern does not occur in the expansion can only
be a commandment.
Page 271
Suppose we look at mathematical propositions as commandments, and even utter them


                                            181
as such? "Let 252 be 625."
Well--a commandment has an internal and an external negation.
Page 271
The symbols "(x).fx" and "($x).fx" are certainly useful in mathematics so long as one is
acquainted with the technique of the proofs of the existence or non-existence to which
the Russellian signs here refer. If however this is left open, then these concepts of the
old logic are extremely misleading.
Page 271
If someone says: "But you surely know what 'this pattern occurs in the expansion'
means, namely this"--and points to a case of occurring,--then I can only reply that what
he shews me is capable of illustrating a variety of facts. For that reason I can't be said to
know what the proposition means just from knowing that he will certainly use it in this
case.


Page Break 272

The opposite of "there exists a law that p" is not: "there exists a law that ~p". But if one
expresses the first by means of P, and the second by means of ~ P, one will get into
difficulties.

14. Suppose children are taught that the earth is an infinite flat surface; or that God
created an infinite number of stars; or that a star keeps on moving uniformly in a
straight line, without ever stopping.
Queer: when one takes something of this sort as a matter of course, as it were in one's
stride, it loses its whole paradoxical aspect. It is as if I were to be told: Don't worry, this
series, or movement, goes on without ever stopping. We are as it were excused the
labour of thinking of an end.
Page 272
'We won't bother about an end.'
Page 272
It might also be said: 'for us the series is infinite'.
Page 272
'We won't worry about an end to this series; for us it is always beyond our ken.'
Page 272
15. The rational numbers cannot be enumerated, because they cannot be counted--but
one can count with them, as with the cardinal numbers. That squint-eyed way of putting
things goes with the whole system of pretence, namely that by using the new apparatus
we deal with


                                               182
Page Break 273
infinite sets with the same certainty as hitherto we had in dealing with finite ones.
Page 273
It should not have been called 'denumerable', but on the other hand it would have made
sense to say 'numberable'. And this expression also informs us of an application of the
concept. For one cannot set out to enumerate the rational numbers, but one can
perfectly well set out to assign numbers to them.
Page 273
But where is the problem here? Why should I not say that what we call mathematics is
a family of activities with a family of purposes?
Page 273
People might for example use calculating as a kind of competitive activity. As children
do sometimes have races in doing sums; only this use of sums plays a quite subordinate
role among us.
Page 273
Or multiplication might strike us as much more difficult than it does--if e.g. we only
calculated orally, and in order to take note of, and so to grasp, a multiplication it were
necessary to bring it into the form of rhyming verse. When someone succeeded in
doing this he would have the feeling of having discovered a wonderful great truth.
Every new multiplication would require a new individual piece of work.
If these people believed that numbers were spirits and that they were


Page Break 274
exploring the domain of spirits by means of their calculations, or compelling the spirits
to manifest themselves--would this now be arithmetic? Again--would it be arithmetic
even in the case where these people used the calculations for nothing else?

16. The comparison with alchemy seems natural. We might speak of a kind of alchemy
in mathematics.
Page 274
Is it already mathematical alchemy, that mathematical propositions are regarded as
statements about mathematical objects,--and mathematics as the exploration of these
objects?
Page 274
In a certain sense it is not possible to appeal to the meaning of the signs in
mathematics, just because it is only mathematics that gives them their meaning.

What is typical of the phenomenon I am talking about is that a mysteriousness about
some mathematical concept is not straight away interpreted as an erroneous
conception, as a mistake of ideas; but rather as something that is at any rate not to be
despised, is perhaps even rather to be respected.
Page 274
All that I can do, is to shew an easy escape from this obscurity and this glitter of the
concepts.

Page 275
Strangely, it can be said that there is so to speak a solid core to all these glistening
concept-formations. And I should like to say that that is what makes them into
mathematical productions.
Page 275
It might be said: what you see does of course look more like a gleaming Fata Morgana;
but look at it from another quarter and you can see the solid body, which only looks
like a gleam without a corporeal substrate when seen from that other direction.

17. 'The pattern is in the series or it is not in the series' means: either the thing looks
like this or it does not look like this.
Page 275
How does one know what is meant by the opposite of the proposition "f occurs in the
series", or even of the proposition "f does not occur in the series"? This question
sounds like nonsense, but does make sense all the same.
Namely: how do I know that I understand the proposition "f occurs in this series"?
True, I can give examples illustrating the use of such statements, and also of the
opposite ones. And they are examples of there being a rule prescribing the occurrence
in a definite region or series of regions, or determining that such an occurrence is
excluded.
Page 275
If "you do it" means: you must do it, and "you do not do it" means: you must not do
it--then "Either you do it, or you do not" is not the law of excluded middle.


Page Break 276
Page 276
Everyone feels uncomfortable at the thought that a proposition can state that
such-and-such does not occur in an infinite series--while on the other hand there is
nothing startling about a command's saying that this must not occur in this series
however far it is continued.

                                              184
Page 276
But what is the source of this distinction between: "however far you go you will never
find this"--and "however far you go you must never do this"?
Page 276
On hearing the proposition one can ask: "how can we know anything like that?" but
nothing analogous holds for the command.
Page 276
The statement seems to overreach itself, the command not at all.
Page 276
Can we imagine all mathematical propositions expressed in the imperative? For
example: "Let 10  10 be 100".
Page 276
And if you now say: "Let it be like this, or let it not be like this", you are not
pronouncing the law of excluded middle--but you are pronouncing a rule. (As I have
already said above.)
Page 276
18. But is this really a way out of the difficulty? For how about all


Page Break 277

the other mathematical propositions, say '252 = 625'; isn't the law of excluded middle
valid for these inside mathematics?
Page 277
How is the law of excluded middle applied?
Page 277
"Either there is a rule that prescribes it, or one that forbids it."
Page 277
Assuming that there is no rule forbidding the occurrence,--why is there then supposed
to be one that prescribes it?
Page 277
Does it make sense to say: "While there isn't any rule forbidding the occurrence, as a
matter of fact the pattern does not occur"?--And if this does not make sense, how can
the opposite make sense, namely, that the pattern does occur?
Page 277
Well, when I say it occurs, a picture of the series from its beginning up to the pattern
floats before my mind--but if I say that the pattern does not occur, then no such picture

                                              185
is of any use to me, and my supply of pictures gives out.
Page 277
What if the rule should bend in use without my noticing it? What I mean is, that I might
speak of different spaces in which I use it.


Page Break 278
Page 278
The opposite of "it must not occur" is "it can occur". For a finite segment of the series,
however, the opposite of "it must not occur in it" seems to be: "it must occur in it".
Page 278
The queer thing about the alternative "f occurs in the infinite series or it does not", is
that we have to imagine the two possibilities individually, that we look for a distinct
idea of each, and that one is not adequate for the negative and for the positive case, as it
is elsewhere.
Page 278
19. How do I know that the general proposition "There is..." makes sense here? Well, if
it can be used to tell something about the technique of expansion in a language game.
Page 278
In one case what we are told is: "it must not occur"--i.e.: if it occurs you calculated
wrong.
In one case what we are told is: "it can occur", i.e., no such interdict exists. In another:
"it must occur in such-and-such a region (always in this place in these regions)". But
the opposite of this seems to be: "it must not occur in such-and-such places"--instead of
"it need not occur there".
But what if the rule were given that, e.g., everywhere where the formation rule for p
yields 4, any arbitrary digit other than 4 can be put in its place?
Consider also the rule which forbids one digit in certain places, but otherwise leaves the
choice open.
Page 278
Isn't it like this? The concepts of infinite decimals in mathematical


Page Break 279
propositions are not concepts of series, but of the unlimited technique of expansion of
series.
Page 279
We learn an endless technique: that is to say, something is done for us first, and then we
do it; we are told rules and we do exercises in following them; perhaps some expression


                                            186
like "and so on ad inf." is also used, but what is in question here is not some gigantic
extension.
Page 279
These are the facts. And now what does it mean to say: "f either occurs in the
expansion, or does not occur"?
Page 279
20. But does this mean that there is no such problem as: "Does the pattern f occur in
this expansion?"?--To ask this is to ask for a rule regarding the occurrence of f. And the
alternative of the existence or non-existence of such a rule is at any rate not a
mathematical one.
Page 279
Only within a mathematical structure which has yet to be erected does the question
allow of a mathematical decision, and at the same time become a demand for such a
decision.
Page 279
21. Then is infinity not actual--can I not say: "these two edges of the slab meet at
infinity"?


Page Break 280
Page 280
Say, not: "the circle has this property because it passes through the two points at
infinity..."; but: "the properties of the circle can be regarded in this (extraordinary)
perspective".
Page 280
It is essentially a perspective, and a far-fetched one. (Which does not express any
reproach.) But it must always be quite clear how far-fetched this way of looking at it is.
For otherwise its real significance is dark.

"he knows what he is doing"?

23. Can one make infinite predictions?--Well, why should one not for example call the
law of inertia one? Or the proposition that a comet describes a parabola?
In a certain sense of course the infinity of the prediction is not taken very seriously.
Page 280
Now what about a prediction that if you expand p, however far you go, you will never
come across the pattern f?--Well, we could say that this is either a non-mathematical
prediction, or alternatively a mathematical rule.

                                             187
Page 280

Someone who has learned to expand           goes to a fortune-teller, and she tells him
that however far he may expand          he will never arrive at the pattern....--Is her
soothsaying a mathematical proposition?


Page Break 281
No.--Unless she says: "If you always expand correctly you will never reach it". But is
that still a prediction?
Page 281
Now it looks as if such a prediction of the correct expansion were imaginable and were
distinct from a mathematical law that it must be thus and thus. So that in the
mathematical expansion there would be a distinction between what as a matter of fact
comes out like this--as it were accidentally--and what must come out.
Page 281
How is it to be decided whether an infinite prediction makes sense?
Page 281
At any rate not by one's saying: "I am certain I mean something when I say...".
Page 281
Besides, the question is not so much whether the prediction makes some kind of sense,
as: what kind of sense it makes. (That is, in what language games it occurs.)

In a field that has been prepared in this way this is a proof of existence.

mathematical technique. Whereas logical technique is only an auxiliary technique in

25. A proof convinces you that there is a root of an equation (without giving you any
idea where)--how do you know that you understand the proposition that there is a root?
How do you know that you are really convinced of anything? You may be convinced
that the application of the proved proposition will turn up. But you do not understand
the proposition so long as you have not found the application.
Page 282
When a proof proves in a general way that there is a root, then everything depends on
the form in which it proves this. On what it is that here leads to this verbal expression,
which is a mere shadow, and keeps mum about essentials. Whereas to logicians it
seems to keep mum only about incidentals.
Page 282
Generality in mathematics does not stand to particularity in mathematics in the same
way as the general to the particular elsewhere.
Page 282
Everything that I say really amounts to this, that one can know a proof thoroughly and
follow it step by step, and yet at the same time not understand what it was that was
proved.


Page Break 283
Page 283
And this in turn is connected with the fact that one can form a mathematical proposition
in a grammatically correct way without understanding its meaning.
Now when does one understand it?--I believe: when one can apply it.
It might perhaps be said: when one has a clear picture of its application. For this,
however, it is not enough to connect a clear picture with it. It would rather have been
better to say: when one commands a clear view of its application. And even that is bad,
for the matter is simply one of not imagining that the application is where it is not; of
not being deceived by the verbal form of the proposition.
Page 283
But how does it come about that one can fail to understand, or can misunderstand, a
proposition or proof in this way? And what is then necessary in order to produce
understanding?
Page 283
There are here, I believe, cases in which someone can indeed apply the proposition (or
proof), but is unable to give a clear account of the kind of application. And the case in
which he is even unable to apply the proposition. (Multiplicative axiom.)†1

One would like to say that the understanding of a mathematical proposition is not
guaranteed by its verbal form, as is the case with most non-mathematical propositions.
This means--so it appears--that the words don't determine the language-game in which

The logical notation swallows the structure.

26. In order to see how something can be called an 'existence-proof', though it does not
permit a construction of what exists, think of the different meanings of the word
"where". (For example the topological and the metrical.)
Page 284
For it is not merely that the existence-proof can leave the place of the 'existent'
undetermined: there need not be any question of such a place.
That is to say: when the proved proposition runs: "there is a number for which..." then
it need not make sense to ask "and which number is it?", or to say "and this number
is...".
Page 284
27. A proof that 777 occurs in the expansion of p, without shewing where, would have
to look at this expansion from a totally new point of view, so that it shewed e.g.
properties of regions of the expansion about which we only knew that they lay very far
out. Only the picture floats before one's mind of having to assume as it were a dark
zone of indeterminate length very far on in p, where we can no longer rely on our
devices for calculating; and then still further out a zone where in a different way we can
once more see something.

28. We can always imagine proof by reductio ad absurdum used in argument with
someone who puts forward a non-mathematical assertion (e.g. that he has seen a
checkmate with such-and-such pieces) which can be mathematically refuted.
Page 285
The difficulty which is felt in connexion with reductio ad absurdum in mathematics is
this: what goes on in this proof? Something mathematically absurd, and hence
unmathematical? How--one would like to ask--can one so much as assume the
mathematically absurd at all? That I can assume what is physically false and reduce it
ad absurdum gives me no difficulty. But how to think the--so to speak--unthinkable?

that: for only the opposite of what you do not want to abandon would be combinable

29. The geometrical illustration of Analysis is indeed inessential; not, however, the
geometrical application. Originally the geometrical illustrations were applications of
Analysis. Where they cease to be this they can be wholly misleading.
What we have then is the imaginary application. The fanciful application.
The idea of a 'cut' is one such dangerous illustration.


Page Break 286

Only in so far as the illustrations are also applications do they avoid producing that
special feeling of dizziness which the illustration produces in the moment at which it

30. Dedekind's theorem could be derived, if what we call irrational numbers were quite
unknown, but if there were a technique of deciding the places of decimals by throwing
dice. And this theorem would then have its application even if the mathematics of
irrational numbers did not exist. It is not as if Dedekind's expansions already foresaw
all the special real numbers. It merely looks like that as soon as Dedekind's calculus is
joined to the calculi of the special real numbers.
Page 286
31. It might be asked: what is there about the proof of Dedekind's theorem that a child
10 years old could not understand?--For isn't this proof far simpler than all the
calculations which the child has to master?--And if now someone were to say: it can't
understand the deeper content of the proposition--then I ask: how does this proposition
come to have a deep content?

Page 286
33. If you want to divide the real numbers into an upper and lower class, then do it first
crudely by means of


Page Break 287




                                            191
two rational points P and Q. Then halve PQ and decide in which half (if not at the point
of division) the cut is supposed to lie; if for example in the lower one, halve this and
make a more exact decision and so on.
If you have a principle for unlimited repetition of this procedure then you can say that
this principle executes a cut, as it decides for each number whether it lies to the right or
to the left.--Now the question is whether I can go all the way by means of such a
principle of division, or whether some other way of deciding is still needed; and again,
whether this would be after finishing the use of the principle, or before. Now in any
case, not before the completion; for so long as the question still is, in which finite bit of
the straight line the point is supposed to lie, further division may decide the
matter.--But after the decision by a principle is there still room for a further decision?
Page 287
It is the same with Dedekind's theorem as with the law of excluded middle: it seems to
exclude a third possibility, whereas a third possibility is not in question here.
Page 287
The proof of Dedekind's theorem works with a picture which cannot justify it; which
ought rather to be justified by the theorem.
Page 287
You readily see a principle of division as an unendingly repeated division, for at any
rate it does not correspond to any finite division and seems to lead you on and on.

34. Couldn't we make a more extensional preparation for the theory of limits,
functions, real numbers, than we do? Even if this preparatory calculus should seem very
trivial and in itself useless?
Page 288
The difficulty of looking at the matter now in an intensional, now again in an
extensional way, is already there with the concept of a 'cut'. That every rational number
can be called a principle of division of the rational numbers is perfectly clear. Now we
discover something else that we can call a principle of division, e.g. what corresponds
to          . Then other similar ones--and now we are already quite familiar with the
possibility of such divisions, and see them under the aspect of a cut made somewhere
along the straight line, hence extensionally. For if I cut, I can of course choose where I

                                             192
want to cut.
But if a principle of division is a cut, it surely is so only because it is possible to say of
any arbitrary rational number that it is on one side or the other of the cut. Can the idea
of a cut now be said to have led us from the rational to the irrational numbers? Are we
for example led to            by way of the concept of a cut?
Now what is a cut of the real numbers? Well, a principle of division into an upper and a
lower class. Thus such a principle yields every rational and irrational number. For even
if we have no system of irrational numbers, still those that we have divide into upper
and lower by reference to the cut (so far, that is, as they are comparable with it).
But now Dedekind's idea is that the division into an upper and lower class (under the
known conditions) is the real number.
Page 288
The cut is an extensional image.


Page Break 289
Page 289
It is of course true that, if I have a mathematical criterion for establishing, for any
arbitrary rational number, whether it belongs to the upper or the lower class, then it is
easy for me systematically to approximate as close as I like to the place where the two
classes meet.
Page 289
In Dedekind we do not make a cut by cutting, i.e. pointing to the place, but--as in
finding        --by approaching the adjacent ends of the upper and the lower class.
Page 289
The thing now is to prove that no other numbers except the real numbers can perform
such a cut.
Page 289
Let us not forget that the division of the rational numbers into two classes did not
originally have any meaning, until we drew attention to a particular thing that could be
so described. The concept is taken over from the everyday use of language and that is
why it immediately looks as if it had to have a meaning for numbers too.
Page 289
When the idea of a cut of the real numbers is now introduced by saying that we simply
have to extend the concept of a cut of the rational numbers to the real numbers--all that
we need is a property dividing the real numbers into two classes (etc.)--then first of all
it is not clear what is meant by such a property, which thus divides all real numbers.
Now our attention can be drawn to the fact that any real number can serve this purpose.
But that gets us only so far and no further.

even as children that a straight line has no end, and I do not know that this idea has ever
given anyone any difficulty. Suppose a finitist were to try to replace this concept by that
of a straight segment of definite length?!
But the straight line is a law for producing further.
Page 290
The concept of the limit and of continuity, as they are introduced nowadays, depend,
without its being said, on the concept of proof. For we say




                                    = 1 when it can be proved that...

This means we use concepts which are infinitely harder to grasp than those that we
make explicit.
Page 290
37. The misleading thing about Dedekind's conception is the idea that the real numbers
are there spread out in the number line. They may be known or not; that does not
matter. And in this way all that one needs to do is to cut or divide into classes, and one
has dealt with them all.
Page 290
It is by combining calculation and construction that one gets the idea that there must be
a point left out on the straight line, namely P,

construct really accurately, then the circle would have to cut the straight line between
its points.'

The irrational numbers are--so to speak--special cases.

What is the application of the concept of a straight line in which a point is missing?!
The application must be 'common or garden'. The expression "straight line with a point

Or suppose one looked at continuity as a property of the sign 'x2 + y2 = z2'--of course
only if this equation and others were ordinarily subjected to a known method of testing.
'This is the relation of this rule (equation) to this particular test.' A test, which goes with
a sidelong glance at a kind of extension.
Page 292
In this test of the equation something is undertaken which is connected with certain
extensions. Though not as if what were in question here were an extension which
would be somehow equivalent to the equation itself. It is just that certain extensions
are, so to speak, alluded to.--The real thing here is not the extension, which is only
faute de mieux described intensionally; rather is the intension described--or


Page Break 293
presented--by means of certain extensions, which are yielded by it then and there.
Page 293
The range of certain extensions casts a sidelight on the algebraic property of the
function. In this sense, then, the drawing of a hyperbola could be said to cast a sidelight
on the equation of the hyperbola.
Page 293
It is no contradiction of this for those extensions to be the most important application of

                                             196

equation.--

Suppose I were to say: extensional considerations (for example the Heine-Borel
theorem) shew: This is how to deal with intensions.

And it will then be possible to attach a diagram as a particular illustration, e.g. to a
procedure with particular intensions. The illustration is a sign, a description, which is

A general formulation of a procedure. The effect is similar to that of introducing the
word "correlation" with a view to the general definition of functions. A general way of
talking is introduced, which is very useful for the characterization of a mathematical
procedure (as in Aristotelian logic). But the danger is that one will think one is in

stimulus) and as it were prepare a form of language for possible employment? For, so
long as it remains empty, the form will contribute to determining the form of

The problem of finding a mathematical decision of a theorem might with some justice

An equation links two concepts; so that I can now pass from one to the other.

An equation constructs a conceptual path. But is a conceptual path a concept? And if
not, is there a sharp distinction between them?
Page 296
Imagine that you have taught someone a technique of multiplying. He uses it in a
language-game. In order not to have to keep on multiplying afresh, he writes the
multiplication in an abbreviated form as an equation, and he uses this where he
multiplied before.
Now he says that the technique of multiplying establishes connexions between the
concepts. He will also say the same thing about a multiplication as a picture of this
transition. And finally he will say the same thing about the equation itself: for it is
essential that the transition should be capable of being represented simply by the
pattern of the equation. That is, that the transition should not always have to be made
anew.
Now will he also be inclined to say that the process of multiplying is a concept?

Page 297
It is surely a movement. It seems to be a movement between two stationary points;
these are the concepts.
Page 297
If I conceive a proof as my movement from one concept to another, then I shall not
want also to say that it is a new concept. But can I not conceive the written
multiplication as one picture, comparable to a number-sign, and may not its functioning
include functioning as a concept-sign?
Page 297

45. How does anyone shew that he understands a mathematical proposition? E.g. by
applying it. So not also by proving it?
Page 297
I should like to say: the proof shews me a new connexion, and hence it also gives me a
new concept.
Page 297
Is not the new concept the proof itself?


Page Break 298
Page 298
But a proof certainly does enable you to form a new judgment. For you can after all say
of a particular pattern that it is or is not this proof.
Page 298
Yes, but is the proof, regarded, interpreted, as a proof, a pattern? As a proof, I might
say, it has to convince me of something. In consequence of it I will do or not do
something. And in consequence of a new concept I don't do or not do anything. So I
want to say: the proof is the pattern of proof employed in a particular way.
And what it convinces me of can be of very various kinds. (Think of the proofs of
Russellian tautologies, or proofs in geometry and in algebra.)
Page 298
A mechanism can convince me of something (can prove something). But under what
circumstances--in the context of what activities and problems--shall I say that it
convinces me of something?
Page 298
"But a concept surely does not convince me of anything, for it does not shew me a
fact."--But why should a concept not first and foremost convince me that I want to use
it?
Page 298
Why should not the new concept, once formed, immediately license my transition to a
judgment?

But if you say "The point isn't understanding at all. Mathematical propositions are only

concept.
Page 299
Hence the issue whether an existence-proof which is not a construction is a real proof
of existence. That is, the question arises: Do I understand the proposition "There is..."
when I have no possibility of finding where it exists? And here there are two points of
view: as an English sentence for example I understand it, so far, that is, as I can explain
it (and note how far my explanation goes). But what can I do with it? Well, not what I
can do with a constructive proof. And in so far as what I can do with the proposition is
the criterion of understanding it, thus far it is not clear in advance whether and to what
extent I understand it.
The curse of the invasion of mathematics by mathematical logic is that now any
proposition can be represented in a mathematical symbolism, and this makes us feel
obliged to understand it. Although of course this method of writing is nothing but the
translation of vague ordinary prose.
Page 299
47. A concept is not essentially a predicate.†1 We do indeed sometimes say: "This thing
is not a bottle" but it is certainly not essential to the language-game with the concept
'bottle' that such judgments occur in it. The thing is to pay attention to how a concept
word ("slab", e.g.) is used in a language-game.

There need not e.g. be such a sentence as "This is a slab" at all; but e.g. merely: "Here

48. 'Mathematical logic' has completely deformed the thinking of mathematicians and
of philosophers, by setting up a superficial interpretation of the forms of our everyday
language as an analysis of the structures of facts. Of course in this it has only continued
to build on the Aristotelian logic.

know?--I know that all mice have them, so this one will too. (And one does not say:
"And this thing is a mouse, so it too...") Why is this such an important move? Well, we
investigate e.g. animals, plants etc. etc.; we form general judgments and apply them in
particular cases.--But it surely is a truth that this mouse has the property, if all mice
have it! That is a determination about the application of the word "all". The factual
generality is to be found somewhere else. Namely, for example, in the general
occurrence of that method of investigation and its application.

The interesting case of generality is this: we often have a means of ascertaining the
general proposition before considering particular cases: and we then use the general

We gave the porter the order only to admit people with invitations and now we count

The interesting generality in the case of the logical proposition is not the fact that it

51. If it is said that the proof shews how (e.g.) 25  25 yield 625, that is of course a
queer way of talking, since for this to be the arithmetical result is not a temporal
process. But the proof does not shew any temporal process either.
Page 301
Imagine a sequence of pictures. They shew how two people fence with rapiers
according to such-and-such rules. A sequence of pictures can surely shew that. Here the
picture refers to a reality. It cannot be said to shew that fencing is done like this, but
how fencing is done. In another sense we can say that the pictures shew how one can
get from this position into that in three movements. And now they also shew that one
can get into that position in this way.

Page 303
1. Proofs give propositions an order. They organize them.
Page 303
2. The concept of a formal test presupposes the concept of a transformation-rule, and
hence of a technique.
Page 303
For only through a technique can we grasp a regularity.
Page 303
The technique is external to the pattern of the proof. One might have a perfectly
accurate view of the proof, yet not understand it as a transformation according to
such-and-such rules.
Page 303
One will certainly call adding up the numbers ... to see whether they come to 1000, a
formal test of the numerals. But all the same that is only when adding is a practised
technique. For otherwise how could the procedure be called any kind of test?
Page 303
It is only within a technique of transformation that the proof is a formal test.


Page Break 304
Page 304
When you ask what right you have to pronounce this rule, the proof is the answer to
your question.

                                            203
Page 304
What right have you to say that? What right have you to say it?
Page 304
How do you test a theme for a contrapuntal property? You transform it according to this
rule, you put it together with another one in this way; and the like. In this way you get a
definite result. You get it, as you would also get it by means of an experiment. So far
what you are doing may even have been an experiment. The word "get" is here used
temporally; you got the result at three o'clock.--In the mathematical proposition which I
then frame the verb ("get", "yields" etc.) is used non-temporally.
The activity of testing produced such and such a result.
So up to now the testing was, so to speak, experimental. Now it is taken as a proof. And
the proof is the picture of a test.
Page 304
The proof, like the application, lies in the background of the proposition. And it hangs
together with the application.
Page 304
The proof is the route taken by the test.
Page 304
The test is a formal one only in so far as we conceive the result as the result of a formal
proposition.


Page Break 305
Page 305
3. And if this picture justifies the prediction--that is to say, if you only have to see it
and you are convinced that a procedure will take such-and-such a course--then
naturally this picture also justifies the rule. In this case the proof stands behind the rule
as a picture that justifies the rule.
Page 305
For why does the picture of the movement of the mechanism justify the belief that this
kind of mechanism will always move in this way?--It gives our belief a particular
direction.
Page 305
When the proposition seems not to be right in application, the proof must surely shew
me why and how it must be right; that is, how I must reconcile it with experience.
Page 305
Thus the proof is a blue-print for the employment of the rule.

4. How does the proof justify the rule?--It shews how, and therefore why, the rule can
be used.
Page 305
The King's Bishop†1 shews us how 8  9 makes 72--but here the rule of counting is
not acknowledged as a rule.
The King's Bishop shews us that 8  9 makes 72: Now we are acknowledging the rule.



Page Break 306
Page 306
Or ought I to have said: the King's Bishop shews me how 8  9 can make 72; that is to
say, it shews me a way?
Page 306
The procedure shews me a How of 'making'.
Page 306
In so far as 8  9 = 72 is a rule, of course it means nothing to say that that shews me
how 8  9 = 72; unless this were to mean: someone shews me a process through the
contemplation of which one is led to this rule.
Page 306
Now isn't going through any proof such a process?
Page 306
Would it mean anything to say: "I want to shew you how 8  9 originally made 72"?
Page 306
5. What is really queer is that the picture, not the reality, should be able to prove a
proposition! As if here the picture itself took over the role of reality.--But that's not how
it is: for what I derive from the picture is only a rule. And this rule does not stand to the
picture as an empirical proposition stands to reality.--The picture of course does not
shew that such-and-such happens. It only shews that what does happen can be taken in
this way.
Page 306
The proof shews how one proceeds according to the rule without a hitch.


Page Break 307
Page 307
And so one may even say: the procedure, the proof, shews one how far 8  9 = 72.

                                            205
Page 307
The picture shews one, not, of course, anything that happens, but that what ever does
happen will allow of being looked at like this.
Page 307
We are brought to the point of using this technique in this case. I am brought to
this--and to that extent I am convinced of something.
Page 307
See, in this way 3 and 2 make 5. Note this procedure. "In doing so you at once notice
the rule."
Page 307
6. The Euclidean proof of the infinity of prime numbers might be so conducted that the
investigation of the numbers between p and p! + 1 was carried out on one or more
examples, and in this way we learned a technique of investigation. The force of the
proof would of course in that case not reside in the fact that a prime number > p was
found in this example. And at first sight this is queer.
It will now be said that the algebraic proof is stricter than the one by way of examples,
because it is, so to speak, the extract of the effective principle of these examples. But
after all, even the algebraic proof is not quite naked. Understanding--I might say--is
needed for both!
Page 307
The proof teaches us a technique of finding a prime number between p and p! + 1. And
we become convinced that this technique must


Page Break 308
always lead to a prime number > p. Or that we have miscalculated if it doesn't.
Page 308
Would one be inclined to say here that the proof shews us how there is an infinite series
of prime numbers? Well, one might say so. And at any rate: "What there being an
infinity of primes amounts to." For it could also be imagined that we had a proof that
did indeed determine us to say that there were infinitely many primes, but did not teach
us to find a prime number > p.
Now perhaps it would be said: "Nevertheless, these two proofs prove the same
proposition, the same mathematical fact." There might be reason at hand for saying
this, or again there might not.

7. The spectator sees the whole impressive procedure. And he becomes convinced of
something; that is the special impression that he gets. He goes away from the
performance convinced of something. Convinced that (for example) he will end up the
same way with other numbers. He will be ready to express what he is convinced of in
such-and-such a way. Convinced of what? Of a psychological fact?--

He will say that he has drawn a conclusion from what he has seen.--Not, however as
one does from an experiment. (Think of periodic division.)

it. In future I shall..."?

He tells us: "I saw that it must be like that."
Page 309
"I realised that it must be like that"--that is his report.
Page 309
He will now perhaps run through the proof procedure in his mind.
Page 309
But he does not say: I realised that this happens. Rather: that it must be like that. This
"must" shews what kind of lesson he has drawn from the scene.
The "must" shews that he has gone in a circle.
Page 309
I decide to see things like this. And so, to act in such-and-such a way.

I imagine that whoever sees the process also draws a moral from it.

that, the determination of a concept.
Let concept here mean method. In contrast to the application of the method.

9. See, 50 and 50 make 100 like this. One has, say, added 10 to 50 five times in
succession. And one goes on with the increase of the number until it grows to 100.
Here of course the observed process would be a process of calculating in some fashion
(on the abacus, perhaps); a proof.
Page 310
The meaning of that "like this" is of course not that the proposition "50 + 50 = 100"
says: this takes place somewhere. So it is not as when I say: "See, a horse canters like
this"--and shew him a picture.
Page 310
One could however say: "See, this is why I say 50 + 50 = 100".
Page 310
Or: See, this is how one gets 50 + 50 = 100.
But if I now say: See, this is how 3 + 2 make 5, laying 3 apples on the table and then 2
more, here I mean to say: 3 apples and 2 apples


Page Break 311
make 5 apples, if none are added or taken away.--Or one might even tell someone: If
you put 3 apples and then 2 more on the table (as I am doing), then what you see now
almost always happens--and there are now 5 apples lying there.
I want perhaps to shew him that 3 apples and 2 apples don't make 5 apples in such a
way as they might make 6 (because e.g. one makes a sudden appearance). This is really
an explanation, a definition of the operation of adding. This is indeed how one might
actually explain adding with the abacus.
Page 311
"If we put 3 things by 2 things, that may yield various counts of things. But we see as a
norm the procedure that 3 things and 2 things make 5 things. See, this is how it looks
when they make 5."
Page 311
Couldn't one say to a child: "Shew me how 3 and 2 make 5." And the child would then
have to calculate 3 + 2 on the abacus.
Page 311
When, in teaching the child to calculate, one asks, "How do 3 + 2 make 5?"--what is he
supposed to shew? Well, obviously he is supposed to move three beads up to 2 beads
and then to count the beads (or something like that).
Page 311

                                           208
Might one not say "Shew me how this theme makes a canon." And someone asked this
would have to prove that it does make a canon.--One would ask someone "how" if one
wanted to to get him to shew that he does grasp what is in question here.


Page Break 312
Page 312
And if the child now shews how 3 and 2 make 5, then he shews a procedure that can be
regarded as a ground for the rule "2 + 3 = 5."
Page 312
10. But suppose one asks the pupil: "Shew me how there are infinitely many prime
numbers."--Here the grammar is doubtful! But it would be appropriate to say: "Shew
me in how far one may say that there are infinitely many prime numbers."
Page 312
When one says "Shew me that it is...," then the question whether it is is already put and
it remains only to answer "yes" or "no". But if one says "Shew me how it is that...",
then here the language-game itself needs to be explained. At any rate, one has so far no
clear concept of what one is supposed to be at with this assertion. (One is asking, so to
speak; "How can such an assertion be justified at all?")
Page 312
Now am I meant to give different answers to the question: "Shew me how..." and
"Shew me that..."?
Page 312
From the proof you derive a theory. If you derive a theory from the proof, then the
sense of the theory must be independent of the proof; for otherwise the theory could
never have been separated from the proof.
In the same way as I can remove auxiliary construction lines in a drawing and leave the
rest.
Page 312
Thus it is as if the proof did not determine the sense of the proposition proved; and yet
as if it did determine it.

But isn't it like that with any verification of any proposition?

11. I believe this: Only in a large context can it be said at all that there are infinitely
many prime numbers. That is to say: For this to be possible there must already exist an
extended technique of calculating with cardinal numbers. That proposition only makes
sense within this technique. A proof of the proposition locates it in the whole system of

                                            209
calculations. And its position therein can now be described in more than one way, as of
course the whole complicated system in its background is presupposed.




Page 313
If for example 3 co-ordinate systems are given a definite mutual arrangement, I can
determine the position of a point for all of them by giving it for any one.

The proof of a proposition certainly does not mention, certainly does not describe, the
whole system of calculation that stands behind the proposition and gives it its sense.

prove it to him? He has got to teach him to calculate. That is here part of the proof. It
takes that, so to speak, to give the question "Are there infinitely many prime numbers?"

this level of knowledge. (On another level there are again new temptations.) But that
doesn't make philosophising any easier!
Page 314
13. Now isn't it absurd to say that one doesn't understand the sense of Fermat's last
theorem?--Well, one might reply: the mathematicians are not completely blank and
helpless when they are confronted by this proposition. After all, they try certain
methods of proving it; and, so far as they try methods, so far do they understand the
proposition.--But is that correct? Don't they understand it just as completely as one can
possibly understand it?
Page 314
Now let us assume that, quite contrary to mathematicians' expectations, its contrary
were proved. So now it is shewn that it cannot be so at all.
Page 314
But, if I am to know what a proposition like Fermat's last theorem says, must I not
know what the criterion is, for the proposition to be true? And I am of course
acquainted with criteria for the truth of


Page Break 315
similar propositions, but not with any criterion for the truth of this proposition.
Page 315
'Understanding' is a vague concept.
Page 315
In the first place, there is such a thing as belief that one understands a proposition.
And if understanding is a psychical process--why should it interest us so much? Unless
experience connects it with the capacity to make use of the proposition.
Page 315
"Shew me how..." means: shew me the connexions in which you are using this
proposition (this machine-part).
Page 315
14. "I am going to shew you how there are infinitely many prime numbers"
presupposes a condition in which the proposition that there are infinitely many prime
numbers had no, or only the vaguest, meaning. It might have been merely a joke to
him, or a paradox.

If this procedure convinces you of that, then it must be very impressive.--But is it?--Not
particularly. Why is it not more so? I believe it would only be impressive if one were to
explain it quite radically. If for example one did not merely write p! + 1, but first
explained it and illustrated it with examples. If one did not presuppose the techniques
as something obvious, but gave an account of them.

as best you can, you will..." The answer is: the first is not a prediction because I might
also have said: "If you follow the rule, you must produce this." It is not a prediction if
the concept of following the rule is so determined, that the result is the criterion for
whether the rule was followed.
Page 317
A says: "If you follow the rule you will get this" or he says simply: "You will get this."
At the same time he draws the resulting arrow there.
Page 317
Now was what A said in this game a prediction? Well damn it, Yes--in a certain sense.
Does that not become particularly clear if we make the suggestion that the prediction
was wrong? It was only not a prediction in the case where the condition turned the
proposition into a pleonasm.

A might have said: "If you are in agreement with each of your steps, then you will

Suppose that while B is deriving the polygon, the arrows of the sheaf were to alter their


                                            213
direction a little. B always draws an arrow parallel, as it is just at this moment. He is
now just as surprised and excited as in the foregoing game, although here the result is
not that of a calculation. So he had taken the first game in the same way as the second.
Page 318
The reason why "If you follow the rule, this is where you'll get to" is not a prediction is
that this proposition simply says: "The result of this calculation is..." and that is a true
or false mathematical proposition: The allusion to the future and to yourself is mere
clothing.
Page 318
Now must A have a clear idea at all, of whether his prediction is meant mathematically
or otherwise? He simply says "If you follow the rule... will result" and enjoys the game.
If for example the predicted result does not come out, he does not investigate any
further.

according to the rule. And the inexorable proposition is that according to this rule this
number is the successor of this one.†1



Page Break 319
Page 319
And this proposition is not an empirical one. But why not an empirical one? A rule is
surely something that we go by, and we produce one numeral out of another. Is it not
matter of experience, that this rule takes someone from here to there?
Page 319
And if the rule + 1 carries him one time from 4 to 5, perhaps another time it carries him
from 4 to 7. Why is that impossible?
Page 319
The question arises, what we take as criterion of going according to the rule. Is it for
example a feeling of satisfaction that accompanies the act of going according to the
rule? Or an intuition (intimation) that tells me I have gone right? Or is it certain
practical consequences of proceeding that determine whether I have really followed the
rule?--In that case it would be possible that 4 + 1 sometimes made 5 and sometimes
something else. It would be thinkable, that is to say, that an experimental investigation
would shew whether 4 + 1 always makes 5.
Page 319
If it is not supposed to be an empirical proposition that the rule leads from 4 to 5, then
this, the result, must be taken as the criterion for one's having gone by the rule.
Page 319
Thus the truth of the proposition that 4 + 1 makes 5 is, so to speak, overdetermined.
Overdetermined by this, that the result of the operation is defined to be the criterion

                                            214
that this operation has been carried out.


Page Break 320
Page 320
The proposition rests on one too many feet to be an empirical proposition. It will be
used as a determination of the concept 'applying the operation + 1 to 4'. For we now
have a new way of judging whether someone has followed the rule.
Page 320
Hence 4 + 1 = 5 is now itself a rule, by which we judge proceedings.
This rule is the result of a proceeding that we assume as decisive for the judgment of
other proceedings. The rule-grounding proceeding is the proof of the rule.
Page 320
17. How does one describe the process of learning a rule?--If A claps his hands, B is
always supposed to do it too.

Remember that the description of a language-game is already a description.

I can train someone in a uniform activity. E.g. in drawing a line like this with a pencil
on paper:




Now I ask myself, what is it that I want him to do, then? The answer is: He is always to
go on as I have shewn him. And what do I really mean by: he is always to go on in that
way? The best answer to this that I can give myself, is an example like the one I have
just given.


Page Break 321
Page 321
I would use this example in order to shew him, and also to shew myself, what I mean
by uniform.
Page 321
We talk and act. That is already presupposed in everything that I am saying.
Page 321
I say to him "That's right," and this expression is the bearer of a tone of voice, a

                                            215
gesture. I leave him to it. Or I say "No!" and hold him back.
Page 321
18. Does this mean that 'following a rule' is indefinable? No. I can surely define it in
countless ways. Only definitions are no use to me in these considerations.
Page 321
19. I might also teach him to understand an order of the form:



                 or
(Let the reader guess what I mean.)
Page 321
Now what do I mean him to do? The best answer that I can give myself to this is to
carry these orders on a bit further. Or do you believe that an algebraic expression of this
rule presupposes less?
Page 321
And now I train him to follow the rule



                      etc.


Page Break 322
And again I don't myself know any more about what I want from him, than what the
example itself shews. I can of course paraphrase the rule in all sorts of different forms,
but that makes it more intelligible only for someone who can already follow these
paraphrases.
Page 322
20. This, then, is how I have taught someone to count and to multiply in the decimal
system, for example.
"365  428" is an order and he complies with it by carrying out the multiplication.
Page 322
Here we insist on this, that the same sum that is set always has the same multiplication-
pattern in its train, and so the same result. Different patterns of multiplication for the
same set sum we reject.
Page 322
The situation will now arise, of a calculator making mistakes in calculation; and also of
his correcting mistakes.

                                            216
Page 322
A further language-game is this: He gets asked "How much is '365  428'?" And he
may act on this question in two different ways. Either he does the multiplication, or if
he has already done it before, he reads off the previous result.
Page 322
21. The application of the concept 'following a rule' presupposes a custom. Hence it
would be nonsense to say: just once in the history of


Page Break 323
the world someone followed a rule (or a signpost; played a game, uttered a sentence, or
understood one; and so on).
Page 323
Here there is nothing more difficult than to avoid pleonasms and only to say what really
describes something.
Page 323
For here there is an overwhelming temptation to say something more, when everything
has already been described.
Page 323
It is of the greatest importance that a dispute hardly ever arises between people about
whether the colour of this object is the same as the colour of that, the length of this rod
the same as the length of that, etc. This peaceful agreement is the characteristic
surrounding of the use of the word "same".
Page 323
And one must say something analogous about proceeding according to a rule.
Page 323
No dispute breaks out over the question whether a proceeding was according to the rule
or not. It doesn't come to blows, for example.
Page 323
This belongs to the framework, out of which our language works (for example, gives a
description).

22. Now someone says that in the series of cardinal numbers that obeys the rule + 1, the
technique of which was taught to us in such-and-such a way, 450 succeeds 449. That is
not the empirical proposition that we come from 449 to 450 when it strikes us that we
have applied the operation + 1 to 449. Rather is it a stipulation that only when the result


                                            217
is 450 have we applied this operation.
Page 324
It is as if we had hardened the empirical proposition into a rule. And now we have, not
an hypothesis that gets tested by experience, but a paradigm with which experience is
compared and judged. And so a new kind of judgment.
Page 324
For one judgment is: "He worked out 25  25, was attentive and conscientious in
doing so and made it 615"; and another: "He worked out 25  25 and got 615 out
instead of 625."
Page 324
But don't the two judgments come to the same thing in the end?
Page 324
The arithmetical proposition is not the empirical proposition: "When I do this, I get
this"--where the criterion for my doing this is not supposed to be what results from it.
Page 324
23. Might we not imagine that the main point in multiplying was the concentration of
the mind in a definite way, and that indeed one didn't always work out the same sums
the same way, but for the particular practical problems that we want to solve, just these
differences of result were advantageous?


Page Break 325
Page 325
Is the main thing not this: that in calculating the main weight would be placed on
whether one has calculated right or wrong, quite prescinding from the psychical
condition etc. of the person who is doing the calculation?
Page 325
The justification of the proposition 25  25 = 625 is, naturally, that if anyone has been
trained in such-and-such a way, then under normal circumstances he gets 625 as the
result of multiplying 25 by 25. But the arithmetical proposition does not assert that. It
is so to speak an empirical proposition hardened into a rule. It stipulates that the rule
has been followed only when that is the result of the multiplication. It is thus
withdrawn from being checked by experience, but now serves as a paradigm for
judging experience.
Page 325
If we want to make practical use of a calculation, we convince ourselves that it has
been "worked out right", that the correct result has been obtained. And there can be
only one correct result of (e.g.) the multiplication; it doesn't depend on what you get
when you apply the calculation. Thus we judge the facts by the aid of the calculation
and quite differently from the way in which we should do so, if we did not regard the
result of the calculation as something determined once for all.

pleasure in writing down number after number in the "natural" number series.
Or he follows the rule in the language-game "Write down the successor of the number

describe an example (or examples).--In order to see whether he has understood the

Suppose someone were to verify the multiplication tables, the logarithm tables etc.,
because he did not trust them. If he reaches a different result, he trusts it, and says that
his mind had been so concentrated on the rule that the result it gets must count as the
right one. If someone points out a mistake to him he says that he would rather doubt the
trustworthiness of his own understanding and his own meaning now than then when he
first made the calculation.
Page 327
We can take agreement for granted in all questions of calculation. But now, does it
make any difference whether we utter the proposition used in calculating as an
empirical proposition or as a rule?
Page 327

26. Should we acknowledge the rule 252 = 625, if we did not all arrive at this result?
Well, why then should we not be able to make use of the empirical proposition instead
of the rule?--Is the answer to that: Because the contrary of the empirical proposition
does not correspond to the contrary of the rule?
Page 327
When I write down a bit of a series for you, that you then see this


Page Break 328
regularity in it may be called an empirical fact, a psychological fact. But, if you have
seen this law in it, that you then continue the series in this way--that is no longer an
empirical fact.
But how is it not an empirical fact?--for "seeing this in it" was presumably not the same
as: continuing it like this.
One can only say that it is not an empirical proposition, by defining the step on this
level as the one that corresponds to the expression of the rule.
Page 328
Thus you say: "By the rule that I see in this sequence, it goes on in this way." Not:
according to experience! Rather: that just is the meaning of this rule.
Page 328
I understand: You say "that is not according to experience"--but still isn't it according to
experience?
Page 328
"By this rule it goes like this": i.e., you give this rule an extension.

But why can't I give it this extension today, that one tomorrow?

If I now see a rule in the sequence that is given me--can that simply consist in, for
example, my seeing an algebraic expression before me? Must it not belong to a
language?
Page 329
Someone writes up a sequence of numbers. At length I say: "Now I understand it; I
must always..." And this is the expression of a rule. But, only within a language!
Page 329
For when do I say that I see the rule--or a rule--in this sequence? When, for example, I
can talk to myself about this sequence in a particular way. But surely also when I
simply can continue it? No, I give myself or someone else a general explanation of how
it is to be continued. But might I not give this explanation purely in the mind, and so
without any real language?

28. Someone asks me: What is the colour of this flower? I answer: "red".--Are you
absolutely sure? Yes, absolutely sure! But may I not have been deceived and called the
wrong colour "red"? No. The certainty with which I call the colour "red" is the rigidity
of my measuring-rod, it is the rigidity from which I start. When I give descriptions, that
is not to be brought into doubt. This simply characterizes what we call describing.

like this, or at least agree to this calculation as the right one; then what does one need

Page 332

"252 = 625" cannot be the empirical proposition that people calculate like that, because
252  626 would in that case not be the proposition that people get not this but another
result; and also it could be true if people did not calculate at all.

The agreement of people in calculation is not an agreement in opinions or convictions.

Could it be said: "In calculating, the rules strike you as inexorable; you feel that you

was set to do, and straightway find himself in the mental state that in the normal course
of things is only produced by training and practice? So that he knew he could calculate
although he had never calculated. (One might, then, it seems, say; The training would
merely be history, and merely as a matter of empirical fact would it be necessary for the
production of knowledge.)--But suppose now he is in that state of certainty and he
calculates wrong? What is he supposed to say himself? And suppose he then multiplied
sometimes right, sometimes again quite wrong.--The training may of course be
overlooked as mere history, if he now always calculates right. But that he can calculate
he shews, to himself as well as to others only by this, that he calculates correctly.

Let us imagine a god creating a country instantaneously in the middle of the wilderness,

mathematics. Now let us contemplate the activity of some human being during these
two minutes. One of these people is doing exactly what a mathematician in England is
doing, who is just doing a calculation.--Ought we to say that this two-minute-man is

Page Break 339
sounds of a word on different occasions, and this will perhaps be a kind of experiment.
On the other hand it may be that we count the sounds in words once for all, make a
calculation, and make use of the result of this counting.
The resulting proposition will in the first case be a temporal one, in the second it will
be non-temporal.
Page 339
When I count the sounds in the word "Daedalus" I can regard the result in two different
ways: (1) The word that is written there (or looks like this or was just now pronounced
or etc.) has 7 sounds. (2) The sound-pattern "Dædalus" has 7 sounds.
The second proposition is timeless.
The employment of the two propositions must be different.
The counting is the same in the two cases. Only, what we reach by means of it is
different.
Page 339
The timelessness of the second proposition is not e.g. a result of the counting, but of the
decision to employ the result of counting in a particular way.
Page 339
In English the word Dædalus has 7 sounds. That is surely an empirical proposition.
Page 339
Imagine that someone counted the sounds in words in order to find or test a linguistic
law, say a law of development of language. He says: "'Dædalus' has 7 sounds". That's
an empirical proposition. Consider


Page Break 340
here the identity of the word. The same word may here have now this, now that number
of sounds.
Page 340
Now I tell someone: "Count the sounds in these words and write down the number by
each word."
Page 340


                                            228
I should like to say: "Through counting the sounds one may get an empirical
proposition--but also one may get a rule."
Page 340
To say: "The word.... has.... sounds--in the timeless sense" is a determination about the
identity of the concept 'The word....'. Hence the timelessness.
Page 340
Instead of "The word.... has.... sounds--in the timeless sense," one might also say: "The
word.... has essentially.... sounds."

"How can one follow a rule?" That is what I should like to ask.

But how does it come about that I want to ask that, when after all I find no kind of
difficulty in following a rule?
Page 341

Page 341
How can I follow a rule, when after all whatever I do can be interpreted as following it?
Page 341
What must I know, in order to be able to obey the order? Is there some knowledge,
which makes the rule followable only in this way?


Page Break 342
Sometimes I must know something, sometimes I must interpret the rule before I apply
it.
Now, how was it possible for the rule to have been given an interpretation during
instruction, an interpretation which reaches as far as to any arbitrary step?
And if this step was not named in the explanation, how then can we agree about what
has to happen at this step, since after all whatever happens can be brought into accord
with the rule and the examples?
Thus, you say, nothing definite has been said about these steps.
Page 342
Interpretation comes to an end.
Page 342
39. It is true that anything can be somehow justified. But the phenomenon of language
is based on regularity, on agreement in action.
Page 342
Here it is of the greatest importance that all or the enormous majority of us agree in
certain things. I can, e.g., be quite sure that the colour of this object will be called
'green' by far the most of the human beings who see it.
Page 342
It would be imaginable that humans of different stocks possessed languages that all had
the same vocabulary, but the meanings of the words were different. The word that
meant green among one tribe, meant same among another, table for a third and so on.
We could even


Page Break 343
imagine that the same sentences were used by the tribes, only with entirely different
senses.

Now in this case I should not say that they spoke the same language.
Page 343
We say that, in order to communicate, people must agree with one another about the
meanings of words. But the criterion for this agreement is not just agreement with
reference to definitions, e.g., ostensive definitions--but also an agreement in judgments.
It is essential for communication that we agree in a large number of judgments.
Page 343
40. Language-game (2),†1 how can I explain it to someone, or to myself? Whenever A
shouts "Slab" B brings this kind of object.--I might also ask: how can I understand it?
Well, only as far as I can explain it.
Page 343
But there is here a queer temptation which expresses itself in my inclination to say: I
cannot understand it, because the interpretation of the explanation is still vague.



Page Break 344
Page 344
That is to say, both to you and to myself I can only give examples of the application.
Page 344
41. The word "agreement" and the word "rule" are related, they are cousins. The
phenomena of agreement and of acting according to a rule hang together.
Page 344
There might be a cave-man who produced regular sequences of marks for himself. He
amused himself, e.g., by drawing on the wall of the cave:




or



But he is not following the general expression of a rule. And when we say that he acts
in a regular way that is not because we can form such and expression.
Page 344
But suppose he now developed p! (I mean without a general expression of the rule.)
Page 344


                                           231
Only in the practice of a language can a word have meaning.
Page 344
Certainly I can give myself a rule and then follow it.--But is it not a rule only for this
reason, that it is analogous to what is called 'rule' in human dealings?


Page Break 345
Page 345
When a thrush always repeats the same phrase several times in its song, do we say that
perhaps it gives itself a rule each time, and then follows the rule?
Page 345
42. Let us consider very simple rules. Let the expression be a figure, say this one:


           |--|

and one follows the rule by drawing a straight sequence of such figures (perhaps as an
ornament).


           | - - || - - || - - || - - || - - |

Under what circumstances should we say: someone gives a rule by writing down such a
figure? Under what circumstances: someone is following this rule when he draws that
sequence? It is difficult to describe this.
Page 345
If one of a pair of chimpanzees once scratched the figure | - - | in the earth and
thereupon the other the series | - - | | - - | etc., the first would not have given a rule nor
would the other be following it, whatever else went on at the same time in the mind of
the two of them.
If however there were observed, e.g., the phenomenon of a kind of instruction, of
shewing how and of imitation, of lucky and misfiring attempts, of reward and
punishment and the like; if at length the one who had been so trained put figures which
he had never seen before one after another in sequence as in the first example, then we
should probably say that the one chimpanzee was writing rules down, and the other was
following them.
Page 345
43. But suppose that already the first time the one chimpanzee had purposed to repeat
this procedure? Only in a particular technique of


Page Break 346
acting, speaking, thinking, can someone purpose something. (This 'can' is the
grammatical 'can'.)

Page 346
It is possible for me to invent a card-game today, which however never gets played. But
it means nothing to say: in the history of mankind just once was a game invented, and
that game was never played by anyone. That means nothing. Not because it contradicts
psychological laws. Only in a quite definite surrounding do the words "invent a game"
"play a game" make sense.
Page 346
In the same way it cannot be said either that just once in the history of mankind did
someone follow a sign-post. Whereas it can be said that just once in the history of
mankind did some walk parallel with a board. And that first impossibility is again not a
psychological one.
Page 346
The words "language", "proposition", "order", "rule", "calculation", "experiment",
"following a rule" relate to a technique, a custom.
Page 346
A preliminary step towards acting according to a rule would be, say, pleasure in simple
regularities such as the tapping out of simple rhythms or drawing or looking at simple
ornaments. So one might train someone to obey the order: "draw something regular",
"tap regularly". And here again one must imagine a particular technique.


Page Break 347
Page 347
You must ask yourself: under what special circumstances do we say that someone has
"made a mere slip of the pen" or "he could perfectly well have gone on, but on purpose
did not do so" or "he had meant to repeat the figure that he drew, but he happened not
to do it".
Page 347
The concept "regular tapping", "regular figure", is taught us in the same way as 'light-
coloured' or 'dirty' or 'gaudy'.
Page 347
44. But aren't we guided by the rule? And how can it guide us, when its expression can
after all be interpreted by us both thus and otherwise? I.e. when after all various
regularities correspond to it. Well, we are inclined to say that an expression of the rule
guides us, i.e., we are inclined to use this metaphor.
Page 347
Now what is the difference between the proceeding according to a rule (say an
algebraic expression) in which one derives number after number according to the
series, and the following proceeding: When we shew someone a certain sign, e.g.
             , a numeral occurs to him; if he looks at the numeral and the sign, another
numeral occurs to him and so on. And each time we engage in this experiment the same
series of numerals occurs to him. Is the difference between this proceeding and that of

                                           233
going on according to the rule the psychological one that in the second case we have
something occurring to him? Might I not say: When he was following the rule "|- -|",
then "| - - |" kept on occurring to him?
Page 347
Well in our own case we surely have intuition, and people say that intuition underlies
acting according to a rule.


Page Break 348
Page 348
So let us assume that that, so to speak, magical sign produces the series 123123123
etc.: is the sign then not the expression of a rule? No.
Acting according to a rule presupposes the recognition of a uniformity and the sign
"123123123 etc." was the natural expression of a uniformity.
Page 348
Now perhaps it will be said that | 22 || 22 || 22 | is indeed a uniform sequence of marks
but surely


           | 2 || 22 || 222 || 2222 |

is not.
Page 348
Well, I might call this another kind of uniformity.
Page 348
45. Suppose however there were a tribe whose people apparently had an understanding
of a kind of regularity which I do not grasp. That is they would also have learning and
instruction, quite analogous to that in § 42. If one watches them one would say that
they follow rules, learn to follow rules. The instruction effects, e.g., agreement in
actions on the part of pupil and teacher. But if we look at one of their series of figures
we can see no regularity of any kind.
What should we say now? We might say: "They appear to be following a rule which
escapes us," but also "Here we have a phenomenon of behaviour on the part of human
beings, which we don't understand".
Page 348
Instruction in acting according to the rule can be described without employing "and so
on".
What can be described in this description is a gesture, a tone of voice, a sign which the
teacher uses in a particular way in giving instruction, and which the pupils imitate. The
effect of these expressions can also



                                           234
Page Break 349
be described, again without calling 'and so on' to our aid, i.e. finitely. The effect of "and
so on" will be to produce agreement going beyond what is done in the lessons, with the
result that we all or nearly all count the same and calculate the same.
Page 349
It would be possible, though, to imagine the very instruction without any "and so on" in
it. But on leaving school the people would still all calculate the same beyond the
examples in the instruction they had had.
Page 349
Suppose one day instruction no longer produced agreement?
Page 349
Could there be arithmetic without agreement on the part of calculators?
Page 349
Could there be only one human being that calculated? Could there be only one that
followed a rule?
Page 349
Are these questions like, say, this one: "Can one man alone engage in commerce?"
Page 349
It only makes sense to say "and so on" when "and so on" is understood. I.e., when the
other is as capable of going on as I am, i.e., does go on just as I do.

Could two people engage in trade with one another?

46. When I say: "If you follow the rule, this must come out," that doesn't mean: it must,
because it always has. Rather, that it comes out is one of my foundations.
Page 350
What must come out is a foundation of judgment, which I do not touch.
On what occasion will it be said: "If you follow the rule this must come out"?
This may be a mathematical definition given in the train of a proof that a particular
route branches. It may also be that one says it to someone in order to impress the nature
of a rule upon him, in order to tell him something like: "You are not making an
experiment here".

47. "But at every step I know absolutely what I have to do; what the rule demands of
me." The rule, as I conceive it. I don't reason. The picture of the rule makes it clear how
the picture of the series is to be continued.
"But I know at every step what I have to do. I see it quite clear before me. It may be
boring, but there is no doubt what I have to do."
Whence this certainty? But why do I ask that question? Is it not enough that this
certainty exists? What for should I look for a source of it? (And I can indeed give
causes of it.)

When someone, whom we fear to disobey, orders us to follow the rule... which we

I can now determine to follow the rule             .

Like this:
But it is remarkable that I don't lose the meaning of the rule as I do it. For how do I
hold it fast?
But--how do I know that I do hold it fast, that I do not lose it?! It makes no sense at all
to say I have held it fast unless there is such a thing as an outward mark of this. (If I
were falling through space I might hold something, but not hold it still.)

Language just is a phenomenon of human life.

48. One person makes a bidding gesture, as if he meant to say "Go!" The other slinks
off with a frightened expression. Might I not call this procedure "order and obedience",
even if it happened only once?
Page 351
What is this supposed to mean: "Might I not call the proceeding----"? Against any such
naming the objection could naturally be made, that among human beings other than
ourselves a quite different


                                            236
Page Break 352
gesture corresponds to "Go away!" and that perhaps our gesture for this order has
among them the significance of our extending the hand in token of friendship. And
whatever interpretation one has to give to a gesture depends on other actions, which
precede and follow the gesture.
Page 352
As we employ the word "order" and "obey", gestures no less than words are intertwined
in a net of multifarious relationships. If I am now construing a simplified case, it is not
clear whether I ought still to call the phenomenon "ordering" and "obeying".

We come to an alien tribe whose language we do not understand. Under what
circumstances shall we say that they have a chief? What will occasion us to say that
this man is the chief even if he is more poorly clad than others? The one whom the
others obey--is he without question the chief?
What is the difference between inferring wrong and not inferring? between adding

man. And that is not combinable with the hardness of the logical "must".

But the logical "must" is a component part of the propositions of logic, and these are
not propositions of human natural history. If what a proposition of logic said was:
Human beings agree with one another in such and such ways (and that would be the
form of the natural-historical proposition), then its contradictory would say that there is
here a lack of agreement. Not, that there is an agreement of another kind.
Page 353
The agreement of humans that is a presupposition of logic is not an agreement in
opinions, much less in opinions on questions of logic.

1. The role of propositions which deal with measures and are not 'empirical

                                            237
propositions'.--Someone tells me: "this stretch is two hundred and forty inches long". I
say: "that's twenty foot, so it's roughly seven paces" and now I have got an idea of the
length.--The transformation is founded on arithmetical propositions and on the
proposition that 12 inches = 1 foot.
Page 355
No one will ordinarily see this last proposition as an empirical proposition. It is said to
express a convention. But measuring would entirely lose its ordinary character if, for
example, putting 12 bits each one inch long end to end didn't ordinarily yield a length
which can in its turn be preserved in a special way.
Page 355
Does this mean that I have to say that the proposition '12 inches = 1 foot' asserts all
those things which give measuring its present point?
No. The proposition is grounded in a technique. And, if you like, also in the physical
and psychological facts that make the technique possible. But it doesn't follow that its
sense is to express these conditions. The opposite of that proposition, 'twelve inches =
one foot' does not say that rulers are not rigid enough or that we don't all count and
calculate in the same way.
Page 355
2. The proposition has the typical (but that doesn't mean simple) role of a rule.


Page Break 356
Page 356
I can use the proposition '12 inches = 1 foot' to make a prediction; namely that twelve
inch-long pieces of wood laid end to end will turn out to be of the same length as one
piece measured in a different way. Thus the point of that rule is, e.g., that it can be used
to make certain predictions. Does it lose the character of a rule on that account?
Page 356
Why can one make those predictions? Well,--all rulers are made alike; they don't alter
much in length; nor do pieces of wood cut up into inch lengths; our memory is good
enough for us not to take numbers twice in counting up to '12', and not to leave any out;
and so on.
Page 356
But then can the rule not be replaced by an empirical proposition saying that rulers are
made in such and such ways, that people do this with them? One might give an
ethnological account of this human institution.
Page 356
Now it is evident that this account could take over the function of a rule.
Page 356
If you know a mathematical proposition, that's not to say you yet know anything. If
there is confusion in our operations, if everyone calculates differently, and each one
differently at different times, then there isn't any calculating yet; if we agree, then we

have only set our watches, but not yet measured any time.
If you know a mathematical proposition, that's not to say you yet know anything.
I.e., the mathematical proposition is only supposed to supply a framework for a
description.

3. How can the mere transformation of an expression be of practical consequence?
Page 357
The fact that I have 25  25 nuts can be verified by my counting 625 nuts, but it can
also be discovered in another way which is closer to the form of expression '25  25'.
And of course it is in the linking of these two ways of determining a number that one
point of multiplying lies.
Page 357
A rule qua rule is detached, it stands as it were alone in its glory; although what gives it
importance is the facts of daily experience.
Page 357
What I have to do is something like describing the office of a king;--in doing which I
must never fall into the error of explaining the kingly dignity by the king's usefulness,
but I must leave neither his usefulness nor his dignity out of account.
Page 357
I am guided in practical work by the result of transforming an expression.
Page 357
But in that case how can I still say that it means the same thing whether I say "here are
625 nuts", or "here are 25  25 nuts"?


Page Break 358
Page 358
If you verify the proposition "here are 625 ..." then in doing that you are also verifying
"here are 25  25 ..."; etc. But the one form is closer to one kind of verification, the
other closer to another.
Page 358
How can you say that "... 625 ..." and "... 25  25 ..." say the same thing?--Only
through our arithmetic do they become one.
Page 358



                                            239
I can at one time arrive at the one, and at another time at the other kind of description,
e.g. by counting. That is to say, I can arrive at either of these forms in either way; but
by different routes.
Page 358
It might now be asked: if the proposition "... 625..." was verified at one time in this way
and at another time in a different way, then did it mean the same thing both times?
Or: what happens if one method of verification gives '625', but the other not '25 
25'?--Is "... 625..." true and "... 25 times 25..." false? No.--To doubt the one means to
doubt the other: that is the grammar given to these signs by our arithmetic.
Page 358
If both ways of counting are supposed to justify giving a number then giving one
number, even though in different forms, is all that is provided for. On the other hand
there is no contradiction in saying: "By one method of counting I get 25  25 (and so
625), by the other not 625 (and so not 25  25)". Arithmetic has no objection to this.


Page Break 359
Page 359
For arithmetic to equate the two expressions is, one might say, a grammatical trick.
In this way arithmetic bars a particular kind of description and conducts description
into other channels. (And it goes without saying that this is connected with the facts of
experience.)
Page 359
4. Suppose I have taught somebody to multiply; not, however, by using an explicit
general rule, but only by his seeing how I work out examples for him. I can then set
him a new question and say: "Do the same with these two numbers as I did with the
previous ones". But I can also say: "If you do with these two what I did with the others,
then you will arrive at the number...". What kind of proposition is that?
"You will write such-and-such" is a prediction. 'If you write such-and-such, then you
will have done it as I shewed you' determines what he calls "following his example".
Page 359
'The solution to this problem is...'.--If I read this before I have worked out the
sum,--what sort of proposition is it?
Page 359
"If you do with these numbers what I did with the others, you will get..."--that surely
means: "The result of this calculation is..."--and that is not a prediction but a
mathematical proposition. But it is none the less a prediction too--A prediction of a
special kind. Just as someone who at the end finds that he really does get such-and-such
when he adds up the column may be really surprised; for example may exclaim: Good
Lord, it does come out!
Just think of this procedure of prediction and confirmation as a


                                            240
Page Break 360
special language-game--I mean: isolated from the rest of arithmetic and its application.
Page 360
What is so singular about this game of prediction? What strikes me as singular would
disappear if the prediction ran: "If you believe that you have gone by my example, then
you will have produced this" or: "If everything seems correct to you, this will be the
result". This game could be imagined in connexion with the administration of a
particular poison and the prediction would be that the injection affects our faculties, our
memory for example, in such-and-such a way.--But if we can imagine the game with
the administration of a poison, then why not with the administration of a medicine? But
even then the weight of the prediction may still always rest on the fact that the healthy
man sees this as the result. Or perhaps: that this satisfies the healthy man.
Page 360
"Do as I do, and this is what you will get" doesn't of course mean: "If you do as I do
then you will do as I do"--nor: "Calculate like this, and you will calculate like
this".--But what does "Do as I do" mean? In the language game--it can simply be an
order: "Now do as I do!"
Page 360
What is the difference between these predictions: "If you calculate correctly you will
get this result"--and: "If you believe you are calculating correctly you will get this
result"?
Now who says that the prediction in my language-game above does not mean the
latter? It seems not to--but what shews this? Ask yourself in what circumstances the
prediction would seem to predict the one thing and in what circumstances the other. For
it is clear that it all depends on the rest of the circumstances.


Page Break 361
Page 361
If you predict that I shall get this, are you not simply predicting that I shall take this
result as correct?--"But"--perhaps you say--"only because it really is correct!"--But
what does it mean to say: "I take the calculation as correct because it is correct"?
Page 361
And yet we can say: the person who is calculating in my language-game does not think
of it as a peculiarity of his nature that he gets this; the fact does not appear to him as a
psychological one.
I am imagining him as under the impression that he has only followed a thread that is
already there, and accepting the How of the following as something that is a matter of
course; and only knowing one explanation of his action, namely: how the thread runs.
Page 361
He does just let himself go on when he follows the rule or the examples; however, he
does not regard what he does as a peculiarity of his course; he says, not: "so that's how

                                             241
I went", but: "so that's how it goes".

But now, suppose someone did say at the end of the calculation in our language-game:
"so that's how I went"--or: "so this course satisfies me"--can I say he has
misunderstood the whole language-game? Certainly not! So long as he does not make
some further unwelcome application of it.
Page 361
5. Isn't it the application that elicits that conception: that it is not we, but the
calculation, that takes a certain course?


Page Break 362
Page 362
The different 'conceptions' must correspond to different applications.
Page 362
For there is indeed a distinction between these two things: being surprised that the
figures on the paper seem to behave like this; and being surprised that this is what
comes out as the result. In each case, however, I see the calculation in a different
context.
Page 362
I think of the feeling of its 'coming out' when for instance we add up a rather long
column of numbers of various patterns, and a round number of 1,000,000 comes out, as
we had been told it would before, "Yes, by Jove, another nought--" we say.
Page 362
"One wouldn't guess it from looking at the numbers", I might say.
Page 362
How would it be if we said--instead of '6  6 gives 36':--'The number 36's being given
by 6  6'?--Replacing the proposition by a substantival expression. (The proof shews
the being given.)
Page 362
Why do you always want to look at mathematics under the aspect of finding and not of
doing?
Page 362
It must have a great influence, that we use the words "right" and "true" and "wrong"
and the form of statement, in calculating. (Head-shaking and nodding.)

Why should I say that the knowledge that this is the way in which all human beings
who have learned to calculate do calculate isn't mathematical knowledge? Because it
seems to point in the direction of a different context.
Page 363
Then is working out what someone will get out by a calculation already applied
mathematics?--and hence also: working out what I myself get out?
Page 363
6. There is no doubt at all that in certain language-games mathematical propositions
play the part of rules of description, as opposed to descriptive propositions.
Page 363
But that is not to say that this contrast does not shade off in all directions. And that in
turn is not to say that the contrast is not of the greatest importance.
Page 363
We feel that mathematics stands on a pedestal--this pedestal it has because of a
particular role that its propositions play in our language games.
Page 363
What is proved by a mathematical proof is set up as an internal relation and withdrawn
from doubt.


Page Break 364
Page 364
7. What is common to a mathematical proposition and a mathematical proof, that they
are both called "mathematical"?
Not, that the mathematical proposition has to be proved mathematically; not, that the
mathematical proof has to prove a mathematical proposition.
What is mathematical about an unproved proposition (an axiom)? what has it in
common with a mathematical proof?
Page 364
Should I answer: "The inference rules of mathematical proof are always mathematical
propositions"? Or: "Mathematical propositions and proofs are used in inference"? That
would be getting closer to the truth.
Page 364
8. Proof must shew an internal relation, not an external one. For we might also imagine
a process of transforming a sentence by experiment, and a transformation which would
be used to predict what would be asserted by the transformed sentence. One might
imagine, e.g., signs getting shifted through adding other signs to them, in such fashion
that they form a true prediction on the basis of the conditions expressed in their initial
position. And if you like, you may regard the calculating human being as an apparatus

                                             243
for such an experiment.
For, that a human being works out the result, in the sense that he doesn't write down the
result at once, but only after he has written down various other things--doesn't make
him any the less a physical-chemical means of producing one sequence of signs from
another.


Page Break 365
Page 365
Thus I should have to say: The proved proposition is not: that sequence of signs which
the man who has received such-and-such schooling produces under such-and-such
conditions.
Page 365
When we think of proving in that way, what we see in it changes entirely. The
intermediate steps become an uninteresting by-product. (Like a rattle in the insides of
the automatic machine before it discharges its wares for us.)
Page 365
9. We say that a proof is a picture. But this picture stands in need of ratification, and
that we give it when we work over it.--
Page 365
True enough; but if it got ratification from one person, but not from another, and they
could not come to any understanding--would what we had here be calculation?
So it is not the ratification by itself that makes it calculation but the agreement of
ratifications.
Page 365
For another game could quite well be imagined, in which people were prompted by
expressions (similar perhaps to general rules) to let sequences of signs come to them
for particular practical purposes, i.e. ad hoc; and that this even proved to pay. And here
the 'calculations' if we choose to call them that, do not have to agree with one another.
(Here we might speak of 'intuition'.)
Page 365
The agreement of ratifications is the pre-condition of our language-game, it is not
affirmed in it.


Page Break 366
Page 366
If a calculation is an experiment and the conditions are fulfilled, then we must accept
whatever comes, as the result; and if a calculation is an experiment then the proposition
that it yields such and such a result is after all the proposition that under such
conditions this kind of sign makes its appearance. And if under these conditions one
result appears at one time and another at another, we have no right to say "there's

                                             244
something wrong here" or "both calculations cannot be all right", but we should have to
say: this calculation does not always yield the same result (why need not be known).
But although the procedure is now just as interesting, perhaps even more interesting,
what we have here now is no longer calculation. And this is of course a grammatical
remark about the use of the word "calculation". And this grammar has of course a
point.
Page 366
What does it mean to reach an understanding about a difference in the result of a
calculation? It surely means to arrive at a calculation that is free of discrepancy. And if
we can't reach an understanding, then the one cannot say that the other is calculating
too, only with different results.
Page 366
10. Now how about this--ought I to say that the same sense can only have one proof?
Or that when a proof is found the sense alters?
Of course some people would oppose this and say: "Then the proof of a proposition
cannot ever be found, for, if it has been found, it is no longer the proof of this
proposition". But to say this is so far to say nothing at all.--
Page 366
It all depends what settles the sense of a proposition, what we choose


Page Break 367
to say settles its sense. The use of the signs must settle it; but what do we count as the
use?--
Page 367
That these proofs prove the same proposition means, e.g.: both demonstrate it as a
suitable instrument for the same purpose.
Page 367
And the purpose is an allusion to something outside mathematics.
Page 367
I once said: 'If you want to know what a mathematical proposition says, look at what its
proof proves'.†1 Now is there not both truth and falsehood in this? For is the sense, the
point, of a mathematical proposition really clear as soon as we can follow the proof?
Page 367
What Russell's '~f(f)' lacks above all is application, and hence meaning.
If we do apply this form, however, that is not to say that 'f(f)' need be a proposition in
any ordinary sense or 'f(x)' a propositional function. For the concept of a proposition,
apart from that of a proposition of logic, is only explained in Russell in its general
conventional features.
Here one is looking at language without looking at the language-game.


                                            245
Page 367
When we say of different sequences of configuration that they shew e.g. that 25  25
= 625, it is easy enough to recognize what fixes the



Page Break 368
place of this proposition, which is reached by the two routes.
Page 368
A new proof gives the proposition a place in a new system; here there is often a
translation of one kind of operation into a quite different kind. As when we translate
equations into curves. And then we realize something about curves and, by means of
that, about equations. But what right have we to be convinced by lines of thought which
are apparently quite remote from the object of our thought?
Well, our operations are not more remote from that object than is, say, dividing in the
decimal system from sharing out nuts. Especially if one imagines (what is quite easy to
imagine) that operation as originally invented for a different purpose from that of
making divisions and the like.
Page 368
If you ask: "What right have we?" the answer is: perhaps none.--What right have you to
say that the development of this system will always run parallel with that one? (It is as
if you were to fix both inch and foot as units, and assert that 12n inches will always be
the same length as n feet.)
Page 368
When two proofs prove the same proposition it is possible to imagine circumstances in
which the whole surrounding connecting these proofs fell away, so that they stood
naked and alone, and there were no cause to say that they had a common point, proved
the same proposition.
One has only to imagine the proofs without the organism of applications which
envelopes and connects the two of them: as it were stark naked. (Like two bones
separated from the surrounding manifold


Page Break 369
context of the organism; in which alone we are accustomed to think of them.)
Page 369
11. Suppose that people calculated with numbers, and sometimes did divisions by
expressions of the form (n - n), and in this way occasionally got results different from
the normal results of multiplying etc. But that nobody minded this.--Compare with this:
lists, rolls, of people are prepared, but not alphabetically as we do it; and in this way it
happens that in some lists the same name appears more than once.--But now it can be
supposed that this does not strike anyone; or that people see it, but accept it without
worrying. As we could imagine people of a tribe who, when they dropped coins on the


                                            246
ground, did not think it worth while to pick them up. (They have, say, an idiom for
these occasions: "It belongs to the others" or the like.)
Page 369
But now times have changed and people (at first only a few) begin to demand
exactness. Rightly, wrongly?--Were the earlier lists not really lists?--
Page 369
Say we quite often arrived at the results of our calculations through a hidden
contradiction. Does that make them illegitimate?--But suppose that we now absolutely
refuse to accept such results, but still are afraid that some might slip through.--Well
then, in that case we have an idea which might serve as a model for a new calculus. As
one can have the idea of a new game.


Page Break 370
Page 370
The Russellian contradiction is disquieting, not because it is a contradiction, but
because the whole growth culminating in it is a cancerous growth, seeming to have
grown out of the normal body aimlessly and senselessly.
Page 370
Now can we say: "We want a calculus which more certainly tells us the truth"?
Page 370
But you can't allow a contradiction to stand!--Why not? We do sometimes use this form
in our talk, of course not often--but one could imagine a technique of language in
which it was a regular instrument.
It might for example be said of an object in motion that it existed and did not exist in
this place; change might be expressed by means of contradiction.
Page 370
Take a theme like that of Haydn's (St. Antony Chorale), take the part of one of
Brahms's variations corresponding to the first part of the theme, and set the task of
constructing the second part of the variation in the style of its first part. That is a
problem of the same kind as mathematical problems are. If the solution is found, say as
Brahms gives it, then one has no doubt;--that is the solution.
Page 370
We are agreed on this route. And yet, it is obvious here that there may easily be
different routes, on each of which we can be in agreement, each of which we might call
consistent.

'We take a number of steps, all legitimate--i.e. allowed by the rules--and suddenly a

contradiction results. So the list of rules, as it is, is of no use, for the contradiction
wrecks the whole game!' Why do you have it wreck the game?
But what I want is that one should be able to go on inferring mechanically according to
the rule without reaching any contradictory results. Now, what kind of provision do you
want? One that your present calculus does not allow? Well, that does not make that
calculus a bad piece of mathematics,--or not mathematics in the fullest sense. The
meaning of the word "mechanical" misleads you.
Page 371
12. When, for some practical purpose, you want to avoid a contradiction mechanically,
as your calculus so far cannot do, this is e.g. like looking for a construction of the
...-gon, which you have up to now only been able to draw by trial and error; or for a
solution of a third degree equation, to which you have so far only approximated.
Page 371
What is done here is not to improve bad mathematics, but to create a new bit of
mathematics.
Suppose I wanted to determine that the pattern '777' did not occur in the expansion of
an irrational number. I might take p and settle that if that pattern occurs, we replace it
by '000'. Now I am told: that is not enough, for whoever is calculating the places is
prevented from looking back to the earlier ones. Now I need another calculus; one in
which I can be assured in advance that it cannot yield '777'. A mathematical problem.


Page Break 372
Page 372
'So long as freedom from contradiction has not been proved I can never be quite certain
that someone who calculates without thinking, but according to the rules, won't work
out something wrong.' Thus so long as this provision has not been obtained the calculus
is untrustworthy.--But suppose that I were to ask: "How untrustworthy?"--If we spoke
of degrees of untrustworthiness mightn't this help us to take the metaphysical sting out
of it?
Were the first rules of the calculus not good? Well, we gave them only because they
were good.--If a contradiction results later,--have they failed in their office? No, they
were not given for this application.
Page 372
I may want to supply my calculus with a particular kind of provision. This does not
make it into a proper piece of mathematics, but e.g. into one that is more useful for a
certain purpose.

13. But suppose the 'axioms' and 'methods of inference' are not just some kind of
construction, but are absolutely convincing. Well, this means that there are cases in
which a construction out of these elements is not convincing.


                                              248
And the logical axioms are in fact not at all convincing if for the propositional variables
we substitute structures which no one originally foresaw as possible values, when, that
is, we began by acknowledging the truth of the axioms absolutely.

But what about saying: the axioms and methods of inference surely ought to be so

Suppose I had erected rules for a game of 'hare and hounds'--fancying it to be a nice
amusing game.--Later, however, I find that the hounds can always win once one knows
how.
Now, let's say, I am dissatisfied with my game. The rules which I gave brought forth a
result which I did not foresee and which spoils the game for me.

14. "N. came upon the fact that in their calculations people had often reduced by
expressions of the form '(n - n)'. He pointed out the consequent discrepancy of results
and shewed how this way of calculating had led to the loss of human life."
Page 373
But let us suppose that other people too had noticed these contradictions, only they had
not been able to give any account of their source. They calculated as it were with a bad
conscience. They had chosen one among contradictory results but with uncertainty,
whereas N's discovery would have made them quite certain.--But did they tell
themselves: "There's something wrong with our calculus"? Was their uncertainty of the
same kind as ours when we do a physical calculation


Page Break 374
but are not certain whether these formulae really give the correct result here? Or was it
a doubt whether their calculating was really calculating? In this case: what did they do
to get over the difficulty?
Page 374
So far these people have only rarely made use of reduction by expressions of values.
But some time somebody discovers that they can actually arrive at any arbitrary result
in this way.--What do they do now? Well, we could imagine very different things. They
may now, e.g., state that this kind of calculation has lost its point, and that in future
people are not to calculate in this way any more.

15. If the calculation lost its point for me as soon as I knew I could work out any
arbitrary result--did it have none so long as I did not know that?
Page 374
I may of course now declare all these calculations to be null--for I have given up doing
them now--but does that mean that they weren't calculations?
Page 374
I at one time inferred via a contradiction without realizing it. Is my result then wrong,
or at any rate wrongly got?

If the contradiction is so well hidden that no one notices it, why shouldn't we call what
we do now proper calculation?
Page 375
We say that the contradiction would destroy the calculus. But suppose it only occurred
in tiny doses in lightning flashes as it were, not as a constant instrument of calculation,
would it nullify the calculus?
Page 375

Imagine people had fancied that (a + b)2 must be equal to a2 + b2. (Is this a fancy of
the same kind as that there must be a trisection of the angle by ruler and compass?) Is it
possible, then, to fancy that two ways of calculating had to yield the same result, if it is
not the same?
Page 375
I add up a column, doing it in a variety of ways (e.g. I take the numbers in a different
order), and I keep on getting random different results.--I shall perhaps say: "I am in a
complete muddle, either I am making random mistakes in calculating, or I am making
certain mistakes in particular connexions: e.g. always saying '7 + 7 = 15' after '6 + 3 =
9'."
Or I might imagine that suddenly, once in the sum, I subtract instead of adding, but
don't think I am doing anything different.
Page 375
Now it might be that I didn't find the mistake and thought I had lost my wits. But this
would not have to be my reaction.

In this field one can ask all sorts of things which, while they belong to the topic, still do

A particular series of questions leads through the centre and out into the open. The rest

It is enormously difficult to find the path through the centre.

It goes via new examples and comparisons. The hackneyed ones don't shew us it.
Page 376
Let us suppose that the Russellian contradiction had never been found. Now--is it quite
clear that in that case we should have possessed a false calculus? For aren't there
various possibilities here?
Page 376
And suppose the contradiction had been discovered but we were not excited about it,
and had settled e.g. that no conclusions were to be drawn from it. (As no one does draw
conclusions from the 'Liar'.) Would this have been an obvious mistake?

Page 377
"But in that case it isn't a proper calculus! It loses all strictness!" Well, not all. And it is
only lacking in full strictness, if one has a particular ideal of rigour, wants a particular
style in mathematics.
'But a contradiction in mathematics is incompatible with its application.
Page 377
'If it is consistently applied, i.e. applied to produce arbitrary results, it makes the
application of mathematics into a farce, or some kind of superfluous ceremony. Its
effect is e.g. that of non-rigid rulers which permit various results of measuring by being

people worked with rulers made of dough, would that of itself have to be called wrong?
Page 377
Couldn't reasons be easily imagined, on account of which a certain elasticity in rulers
might be desirable?

There is one mistake to avoid: one thinks that a contradiction must be senseless: that is
to say, if e.g. we use the signs 'p', '~', '.' consistently,

then 'p.~p' cannot say anything.--But think: what does it mean to continue such and
such a use 'consistently'? ('A consistent continuation of this bit of a curve.')

16. What does mathematics need a foundation for? It no more needs one, I believe, than
propositions about physical objects--or about sense impressions, need an analysis.
What mathematical propositions do stand in need of is a clarification of their grammar,
just as do those other propositions.

The mathematical problems of what is called foundations are no more the foundation of
mathematics for us than the painted rock is the support of a painted tower.

'But didn't the contradiction make Frege's logic useless for giving a foundation to

with which to derive arithmetical propositions. He derived the contradiction unawares,

one forgets that it possesses this value in virtue of a technique which is a fact of natural
history, but whose rules do not play the part of propositions of natural history.

Our experimental activities have indeed a characteristic physiognomy. If I see

burner, I am inclined to say he is making an experiment.
Page 379
Let us suppose that people, who know how to count, want--just as we do--to know
numbers for practical purposes of various kinds. And to this end they ask certain people
who, having had the practical problem explained to them, shut their eyes, and let the
appropriate number occur to them--here there wouldn't be any calculation, however
trustworthy the numbers given might be. This way of determining numbers might be
even more trustworthy in practice than any calculation.

A calculation--it might be said--is perhaps a part of the technique of an experiment, but

An action is an 'experiment' only as seen from a certain point of view. And it is obvious
that the action of calculating can also be an experiment.
I may for example want to test what this man calculates, in such-and-such

you want to know what 52  63 is? I may very well ask that--my question may even

proposition about her behaviour or about her suffering?)

"Yes, but surely our calculating must be founded on empirical facts!" Certainly. But
what empirical facts are you now thinking of? The psychological and physiological
ones that make it possible, or those that make it a useful activity? The connexion with
the latter consists in the fact that the calculation is the picture of an experiment as it
practically always turns out. From the former it gets its point, its physiognomy; but that
is certainly not to say that the propositions of mathematics have the functions of
empirical propositions. (That would almost be as if someone were to believe that

                                            254
because only the actors appear in the play, no other people could usefully be employed
upon the stage of the theatre.)
Page 382
There are no causal connexions in a calculation, only the connexions of the pattern.
And it makes no difference to this that we work over the proof in order to accept it.
That we are therefore tempted to say that it arose as the result of a psychological
experiment. For the psychical course of events is not psychologically investigated when
we calculate.

'There are 60 seconds to a minute.' This proposition is very like a mathematical one.
Does its truth depend on experience?--Well, could we talk about minutes and hours, if
we had no sense of time; if there were no clocks, or could be none for physical reasons;
if there did not exist all the connexions that give our measures of time meaning and
importance? In that case--we should say--the measure of time would have lost its
meaning (like the action of delivering check-mate if the game of chess were to
disappear)--or it would have some quite different meaning. But suppose our experience
were like that--then would experience make the proposition false; and the contrary
experience make it true? No; that would not describe its function. It functions quite
differently.

not exist, any more than measuring quite in our sense?--Yes.--But then why do I want
to take the trouble to work out what mathematics is?
Because we have a mathematics, and a special conception of it, as it were an ideal of its

20. The problem: find the number of ways in which we can trace the joins in this wall:




continuously and without repetition, will be recognized by everyone as a mathematical
problem.--If the drawing were much bigger and more complicated, and could not be
taken in at a glance, it could be supposed to change without our noticing; and then the
problem of finding that number (which perhaps changes according to some law) would
no longer be a mathematical one. But even if it does not change, the problem is, in this
case, still not mathematical.--But even when the wall can be taken in at a glance, that
cannot be said to make the question mathematical, as when we say: this question is now
a question in embryology. Rather: here we need a mathematical solution. (Like: here
what we need is a model.)
Page 384
Did we 'recognize' the problem as a mathematical one because mathematics treats of
making tracings from drawings?
Page 384
Why, then, are we inclined to call this problem straight away a 'mathematical' one?
Because we see at once that here the answer to a mathematical question is practically
all we need. Although the problem could easily be seen as, for example, a
psychological one.
Similarly with the task of folding a piece of paper in such-and-such a way.

It may look as if mathematics were here a science that makes experiments with units;

                                             256
experiments, that is, in which it does not matter what kind of units they are, whether for
instance they are peas, glass marbles, strokes and so on.--Mathematics discovers only
what holds for all these things. And so it does not discover anything about e.g. their
melting point, but that 2 and 2 of them are 4. And the first problem of the wall is a
mathematical one, i.e. can be solved by means of this kind of experiment.--And what
does the mathematical experiment consist in? Well, in setting things out and moving
them about, in drawing lines, writing down expressions, propositions, etc. And we must
not be disturbed by the fact that the outward appearance of these experiments is not that
of physical or chemical experiments, etc.; they just are of a different kind. Only there is
a difficulty here: the procedure is easy enough to see, to describe,--but how is it to be
looked at as an experiment? What is the head and what the tail of the experiment here?
What are the conditions of the experiment, what its result? Is the result what is yielded
by the calculation; or the pattern of calculation; or the assent (whatever that consists in)
of the person doing the calculation?
Page 385
But does it make the principles of dynamics, say, into propositions of pure mathematics
if we leave their interpretation open, and then use them to produce a system of
measurement?
Page 385
'A mathematical proof must be perspicuous'--this is connected with the perspicuousness
of that figure.
Page 385
21. Do not forget that the proposition asserting of itself that it is unprovable is to be
conceived as a mathematical assertion--for that is not a matter of course.
It is not a matter of course that the proposition that such-and-such


Page Break 386
a structure cannot be constructed is to be conceived as a mathematical proposition.
Page 386
That is to say: when we said: "it asserts of itself"--this has to be understood in a special
way. For here it is easy for confusion to occur through the variegated use of the
expression "this proposition asserts something of...".
Page 386
In this sense the proposition '625 = 25  25' also asserts something about itself:
namely that the left-hand number is got by the multiplication of the numbers on the
right.
Page 386
Gödel's proposition, which asserts something about itself, does not mention itself.
Page 386
'The proposition says that this number cannot be got from these numbers in this
way.'--But are you also certain that you have translated it correctly into English?


                                             257
Certainly it looks as if you had.--But isn't it possible to go wrong here?
Page 386
Could it be said: Gödel says that one must also be able to trust a mathematical proof
when one wants to conceive it practically, as the proof that the propositional pattern can
be constructed according to the rules of proof?
Or: a mathematical proposition must be capable of being conceived as a proposition of
a geometry which is actually applicable to itself. And if one does this it comes out that
in certain cases it is not possible to rely on a proof.


Page Break 387
Page 387
The limits of empiricism†1 are not assumptions unguaranteed, or intuitively known to
be correct: they are ways in which we make comparisons and in which we act.
Page 387
22. 'Let us assume that we have an arithmetical proposition saying that a particular
number... cannot be obtained from the numbers ..., ..., ..., by means of such and such
operations. And let us assume that a rule of translation can be given according to which
this arithmetical proposition is translatable into the figures of the first number--the
axioms from which we are trying to prove it, into the figures of the other numbers--and
our rules of inference into the operations mentioned in the proposition.--If we had then
derived the arithmetical proposition from the axioms according to our rules of
inference, then by this means we should have demonstrated its derivability, but we
should also have proved a proposition which, by that translation rule, can be expressed:
this arithmetical proposition (namely ours) is not derivable.'
What would have to be done here? I am supposing that we trust our construction of the
propositional sign; i.e. we trust the geometrical proof. So we say that this 'propositional
pattern' can be obtained from those in such and such ways. And, merely translated into
another notation, this means: this number can be got from those by means of these
operations. So far the proposition and its proof have nothing to do with any special
logic. Here the constructed proposition was simply another way of writing the
constructed number; it had the form of a proposition but we don't compare it with other
propositions as a sign saying this or that, making sense.
Page 387
But it must of course be said that that sign need not be regarded either as a
propositional sign or as a number sign.--Ask yourself: what makes it into the one, and
what into the other?



Page Break 388
Page 388
If we now read the constructed proposition (or the figures) as a proposition of
mathematical language (in English, say) then it says the opposite of what we regard as
proved. Thus we have demonstrated the falsity of the real sense of the proposition and

                                            258
at the same time proved it--if, that is, we look on its construction from the admitted
axioms by means of the admitted rules of inference as a proof.
Page 388
If someone objects to us that we couldn't make such assumptions, for they would be
logical or mathematical assumptions, then we reply that we need only assume that
someone has made a mistake in calculating and so has reached the result we 'assume',
and that for the time being he cannot find the mistake.
Page 388
Here once more we come back to the expression "the proof convinces us". And what
interests us about conviction here is neither its expression by voice or gesture, nor yet
the feeling of satisfaction or anything of that kind; but its ratification in the use of what
is proved.
Page 388
It might justly be asked what importance Gödel's proof has for our work. For a piece of
mathematics cannot solve problems of the sort that trouble us.--The answer is that the
situation, into which such a proof brings us, is of interest to us. 'What are we to say
now?'--That is our theme.
Page 388
However queer it sounds, my task as far as concerns Gödel's proof seems merely to
consist in making clear what such a proposition as:


Page Break 389
Page 389
"Suppose this could be proved" means in mathematics.
Page 389
23. We take it much too much for granted that we ask "How many?" and thereupon
count and calculate.
Page 389
Do we count because it is practical to count? We count!--And in the same way we
calculate.
Page 389
An experiment--or whatever one likes to call it--can be what we go on, sometimes in
determining the measurement of the thing measured, and sometimes even in
determining the appropriate measure.
Page 389
Then is the unit of measurement in this way the result of measurements? Yes and no.
Not the result reached in measuring but perhaps the consequence of measurements.

                                             259
"Has experience taught us to calculate in this way?" would be one question and: "Is
calculation an experiment?" another.
Page 389
24. But isn't it possible to derive anything from anything according to some rule or
other--nay, according to any rule with a suitable interpretation? What does it mean for
me to say, for example: this number can be got from that pair of numbers by
multiplying? Ask yourself: When does one use this proposition? Well, it isn't, e.g., a
psychological proposition saying what humans will do under certain conditions;


Page Break 390
what will satisfy them; nor is it a physical proposition concerning the behaviour of
marks on paper. That is, it will be applied in a surrounding other than a psychological
or physical one.
Page 390
Assume that human beings learn to calculate, roughly as they in fact do; but now
imagine different 'surroundings' which turn the calculating, now into a psychological
experiment, now into a physical experiment with the marks used in calculating, now
into something else!
We assume that children learn counting and the simple kinds of sum by means of
imitation, encouragement and correction. But now, from a certain point of view, the
nonagreement of the one who is doing the sums (i.e., the mistakes) get treated, not as
something bad, but as something psychologically interesting. "So you took that for
correct then, did you? The rest of us did it like this."
Page 390
I want to say that what we call mathematics, the mathematical conception of the
proposition 13  14 = 182, hangs together with the special position that we assign to
the activity of calculating. Or, the special position that the calculation... has in our life,
in the rest of our activities. The language-game in which it is found.

One may learn a piece of music by heart in order to be able to play it correctly; but also

right you will get such-and-such a result; whereupon he carries out the calculation and
is pleased at the correctness, and sometimes the incorrectness, of my prediction. What
does this language-game presuppose? That 'mistakes in calculating' are easy to
discover, and that agreement about the rightness or wrongness of the calculation is
always quickly achieved.

What is the criterion for a step in the calculation's being right; isn't it that the step
seems right to me, and other things of the same sort?
What is the criterion for my working out the same figure twice? Isn't it things like the
figures' appearing to me to be the same?
Page 391
What is the criterion for my having followed the paradigm here?
Page 391
"If you say that each step is correct, this is what will come out."

A logical conclusion is being drawn, when no experience can contradict the conclusion
without contradicting the premises. I.e., when the inference is only a movement within
the means of representation.
Page 392
26. In some language-game sentences are used; reports, orders and so on. And now the
people also employ calculating propositions. They say them to themselves perhaps, in
between the orders and the reports.
Page 392
A language-game, in which someone calculates according to a rule and places the
blocks of a building according to the results of the calculation. He has learnt to operate
with written signs according to rules.--Once you have described the procedure of this
teaching and learning, you have said everything that can be said about acting correctly
according to a rule. We can go no further. It is no use, for example, to go back to the
concept of agreement, because it is no more certain that one proceeding is in agreement
with another, than that it has happened in accordance with a rule. Admittedly going
according to a rule is also founded on an agreement.
Page 392
To repeat, what the correct following of a rule consists in cannot be described more
closely than by describing the learning of 'proceeding according to the rule.' And this
description is an everyday one, like that of cooking and sewing, for example. It

                                              261
presupposes as much as these. It distinguishes one thing from another, and so it informs
a human being who is ignorant of something particular. (Cf. the remark: Philosophy
doesn't use a preparatory language, etc.)


Page Break 393
Page 393
For if you give me a description of how people are trained in following a rule and how
they react correctly to the training, you will yourself employ the expression of a rule in
the description and will presuppose that I understand it.
Page 393
We have, then, taught someone the technique of multiplying. So we employ
expressions of acquiescence and rejection. We shall also sometimes write down the
goal of the multiplication: "You must get this, if it is to be right," we may say to him.
Page 393
But now, can the pupil contradict and say: "How do you know that? And what do you
want?--Do you want me to follow the rule, or to get this result? For there's no need for
the two to coincide." Well, we do not assume that the pupil can say that; we assume that
he accepts the rule as valid when approached from either side. That he conceives both
the individual step and the multiplication-pattern--and therefore the result of the
multiplication--as criteria of correctness, and if these are not in accord with one
another, he believes there is some confusion of his senses.
Page 393
27. Now is it imaginable for someone to follow the rule right and nevertheless to work
out different results at different times in multiplying 15  13? It all depends on what
criteria one allows to count for correct following of the rule. In mathematics the result
itself is also a criterion for correct calculation. Here then it is unthinkable that one
should follow the rule right and should produce different patterns of multiplication.

Not letting a contradiction stand is something that characterises the technique of our
employment of our truth-functions. If we do let the contradiction stand in our language-
games, we alter that technique--as, if we departed from regarding a double negative as
an affirmative. And this alteration would be significant, because the technique of our
logic is connected in its character with the conception of the truth-functions.
Page 394
"The rules compel me to..."--this can be said if only for the reason that it is not all a
matter of my own will what seems to me to agree with the rule. And that is why it can
even happen that I memorize the rules of a board-game and subsequently find out that
in this game whoever starts must win. And it is something like this, when I discover
that the rules lead to a contradiction.

'How does one count in the decimal system?'--"We write 2 after 1, 3 after 2, ... 14 after

indeed something he doesn't know, does understand 'and so on'. And understanding it


Page Break 395
means not understanding it as an abbreviation: it does not mean that he now sees a
much longer series in his mind than that of my examples. That he understands it comes
out in his now making certain applications, in his saying this and acting so in particular
cases.
Page 395
"How do we count in the decimal system?"-- ......... --Now is that not an answer?--But it
isn't one for someone who did not understand the 'and so on'.--But may our explanation
not have made it intelligible to him? May he not, through it, have got hold of the idea
of the rule?--Ask yourself what are the criteria for his having got hold of the idea now.
Page 395
What is it that compels me?--the expression of the rule?--Yes, once I have been
educated in this way. But can I say it compels me to follow it? Yes: if here one thinks of
the rule, not as a line that I trace, but rather as a spell that holds us in thrall.

"'Two-syllabled' is heterological", or "'Four-syllabled' is not heterological" are
empirical propositions. It might be important in some contexts to find out whether
adjectives possess the properties they stand for or not. The word "heterological" would

be used in a language-game. But now, is the proposition "'h'  h" supposed to be an

empirical proposition? It obviously is not one, nor should we admit it as a proposition
in our language-game even if we had not discovered the contradiction.
Page 396
'h'  h  ~ ('h'  h) might be called 'a true contradiction'.--But this contradiction is
not a significant proposition! Agreed, but the tautologies of logic aren't either.
Page 396
"The contradiction is true" means: it is proved; derived from the rules for the word "h".
Its employment is, to shew that "'h'" is one of those words which do not yield a
proposition when inserted into 'x  h'.
Page 396
"The contradiction is true" means: this really is a contradiction, and so you cannot use
the word "'h'" as an argument in 'x  h'.

have to accept as a move and when I want to reply according to my rules, whatever I do
proves to conflict with the rules. How can this have come about? When I set the rules
up, I said something: I was following a certain use. I did not foresee what we should go
on to do, or I saw only a particular possibility. It was just as if I had said to somebody:
"Give up the game; you can't mate with these pieces" and had overlooked an existing
possibility of mating.

The various half joking guises of logical paradox are only of interest in so far as they
remind anyone of the fact that a serious form of the paradox is indispensable if we are

You may instruct someone what to do in such-and-such a case; and these instructions

30. Logical inference is part of a language-game. And someone who carries out logical
inferences in the language-game follows certain instructions which were given him in
the actual learning of the language-game. If, say, a builder's mate is building a house in
accordance with certain orders, he has to interrupt his cartage of materials etc. from
time to time and carry out certain operations with signs on paper; and then he takes up
his work again in conformity with the result.

Imagine a procedure in which someone who is pushing a wheelbarrow comes to realize

push. I don't mean that he says to himself. "Whenever the wheelbarrow can't be
pushed...", but he simply acts in this way. And he happens to shout to someone else:
"The wheelbarrow won't push; clean the axle", or again: "The wheelbarrow won't push.
So the axle needs cleaning." Now this is an inference. Not a logical one, of course.

Can I now say: "Non-logical inference can prove wrong; but logical inference not"?

Is logical inference correct when it has been made according to rules; or when it is
made according to correct rules? Would it be wrong, for example, if it were said that p
should always be inferred from ~p? But why should one not rather say: such a rule
would not give the signs '~p' and 'p' their usual meaning?
Page 398
We can conceive the rules of inference--I want to say--as giving the signs their
meaning, because they are rules for the use of these signs. So that the rules of inference
are involved in the determination of the meaning of the signs. In this sense rules of
inference cannot be right or wrong.

As one could imagine sounds being emitted for purposes now served by language,

mathematics?--But the question arises: don't we call it 'mathematics' only because e.g.
there are transitions, bridges from the fanciful to non-fanciful applications? That is to
say: should we say that people possessed a mathematics if they used calculating,
operating with signs, merely for occult purposes?
Page 399
33. But in that case isn't it incorrect to say: the essential thing about mathematics is that
it forms concepts?--For mathematics is after all an anthropological phenomenon. Thus
we can recognize it as the essential thing about a great part of mathematics (of what is
called 'mathematics') and yet say that it plays no part in other regions. This insight by
itself will of course have some influence on people once they learn to see mathematics
in this way. Mathematics is, then, a family; but that is not to say that we shall not mind

E.g. we infer mathematical propositions; and wrong ones. But we accept these

calculation wrong; or was it not a calculation?
Certainly, if we are explorers observing the people who do this we shall perhaps say:
these people don't calculate at all. Or: there is an element of arbitrariness in their
calculations, which distinguishes the nature of their mathematics from ours. And yet we

to which one can only ascribe a sense out of politeness; still I do not want to take it like
that, but as a proper sentence, if only it is taken right. (And so not as in the Tractatus.)
Thus my conception is a different one here. Now this means that I am saying: there is a
language-game with this sentence too.

"The class of cats is not a cat."--How do you know?

The fable says: "The lion went for a walk with the fox", not a lion with a fox; nor yet
the lion so-and-so with the fox so-and-so. And here it actually is as if the species lion
came to be seen as a lion. (It isn't as Lessing†1 says, as if a particular lion were put in
the place of some lion or other. "Reynard the Fox" does not mean: a fox of the name
"Reynard".)
Page 403
Imagine a language in which the class of lions is called "the lion of all lions", the class
of trees "the tree of all trees", etc.--Because people imagine all lions as forming one big
lion. (We say: "God created man".)
Then it would be possible to set up the paradox that there isn't a definite number of all
lions. And so on.

But isn't a rule something arbitrary? Something that I lay down? And could I lay it
down that the multiplication 18  15 shall not yield 270?--Why not?--But then it just
hasn't taken place according to the rule which I first laid down, and whose use I have
practised.
Is something that follows from a rule itself in turn a rule? And if not,--what kind of
proposition am I to call it?
Page 404
"It is... impossible for human beings to recognize an object as different from itself."
Well, if only I had an inkling how it is done,--I should try at once!--But, if it is
impossible for us to recognize an object as different from itself, is it quite possible to
recognize two objects as different from one another? I have e.g. two chairs before me
and I recognize that they are two. But here I may sometimes believe that they are only
one; and in that sense I can also take one for two.--



Page Break 405
But that doesn't mean that I recognize the chair as different from itself! Very well; but
then neither have I recognized the two as different from one another. If you think you
can do this and you are playing a kind of psychological game, then translate it into a
game with gestures. When you have two objects before you, point with each hand at
one of them; as if, as it were, you wanted to indicate that they were independent. If you
only have one object before you then you point to it with both hands in order to indicate
that no difference between it and itself can be made.--But now, why should one not
play the game the opposite way?
Page 405
39. The words "right" and "wrong" are used when giving instruction in proceeding
according to a rule. The word "right" makes the pupil go on, the word "wrong" holds
him back. Now could one explain these words to a pupil by saying instead: "this agrees
with the rule--that not"? Well yes, if he has a concept of agreement. But what if this has
yet to be formed? (The point is how he reacts to the word "agree".)
Page 405
One does not learn to obey a rule by first learning the use of the word "agreement".

"If you accept this rule you must do this."--This may mean: the rule doesn't leave two
paths open to you here. (A mathematical proposition.) But I mean: the rule conducts

could be interpreted in all sorts of ways.--Here is the rule, like an order! And like an
order too in its effect.

40. A language-game: to bring something else; to bring the same. Now, we can imagine
how it is played.--But how can I explain it to anyone? I can give him this training.--But
then how does he know what he is to bring the next time as 'the same'--with what
justice can I say that he has brought the right thing or the wrong?--Of course I know
very well that in certain cases people would turn on me with signs of opposition.
And does this mean e.g. that the definition of "same" would be this: same is what all or
most human beings with one voice take for the same?--Of course not.
Page 406
For of course I don't make use of the agreement of human beings to affirm identity.
What criterion do you use, then? None at all.
Page 406
To use the word without a justification does not mean to use it wrongfully.
Page 406
The problem of the preceding language-game exists also here: Bring me something red.
For what shews me that something is red? The

Well, I say it; and it cannot be justified. And it is characteristic of this language-game
as of the other that all men consent in it without question.

An undecided proposition of mathematics is something that is accepted neither as a rule

Imagine equations used as ornaments (wallpaper patterns), and now a test of these

41. A proof that shews that the pattern '777' occurs in the expansion of p, but does not
shew where.†1 Well, proved in this way this 'existential proposition' would, for certain
purposes, not be a rule. But might it not serve e.g. as a means of classifying expansion
rules? It would perhaps be proved in an analogous way that '777' does not occur in p2
but it does occur in p  e etc. The question would simply be: is it reasonable to say of
the proof concerned: it proves the existence



Page Break 408
of '777' in this expansion? This can be simply misleading. It is in fact the curse of
prose, and particularly of Russell's prose, in mathematics.
Page 408
What harm is done e.g. by saying that God knows all irrational numbers? Or: that they
are already all there, even though we only know certain of them? Why are these
pictures not harmless?
Page 408
For one thing, they hide certain problems.--
Page 408
Suppose that people go on and on calculating the expansion of p. So God, who knows
everything, knows whether they will have reached '777' by the end of the world. But
can his omniscience decide whether they would have reached it after the end of the
world? It cannot. I want to say: Even God can determine something mathematical only
by mathematics. Even for him the mere rule of expansion cannot decide anything that it
does not decide for us.
Page 408
We might put it like this: if the rule for the expansion has been given us, a calculation
can tell us that there is a '2' at the fifth place. Could God have known this, without the
calculation, purely from the rule of expansion? I want to say: No.

The concept of the rule for the formation of an infinite decimal is--of course--not a
specifically mathematical one. It is a concept connected with a rigidly determined
activity in human life. The concept of this rule is not more mathematical than that of:
following the rule. Or again: this latter is not less sharply defined than the concept of
such a rule itself.--For the expression of the rule and its sense is only a part of the
language-game: following the rule.
Page 409
One has the same right to speak of such rules in general, as of the activities of
following them.
Page 409
Of course, we say: "all this is involved in the concept itself", of the rule for
example--but what that means is that we incline to these determinations of the concept.
For what have we in our heads, which of itself contains all these determinations?
Page 409
A number is, as Frege says, a property of a concept--but in mathematics it is a mark of
a mathematical concept. 0 is a mark of the concept of a cardinal number; and the
property of a technique. 20 is a mark of the concept of an infinite decimal, but what
is this number a property of? That is to say: of what kind of concept can one assert it
empirically?

If I have proved that 18  15 = 270, I have thereby also proved the geometrical
proposition that we get the sign '270' by applying certain transformation rules to the
sign '18  15'.--Now suppose that people, having their vision or memory impaired (as

                                            272
we now put it) by some harmful drug, did not get '270' when they did this
calculation.--If we cannot use it to make a correct prediction of the result anyone is
going to get under normal circumstances, isn't the calculation useless? Well, even if it
is, that does not shew that the proposition '18  15 = 270' is the empirical proposition:
people in general calculate like this.
Page 410
On the other hand it is not clear that the general agreement of people doing calculations
is a characteristic mark of all that is called "calculating". I could imagine that people
who had learned to calculate might in particular circumstances, say under the influence
of opium, begin to calculate differently from one another, and might make use of these
calculations; and that they were not said not to be calculating at all and to be
deranged--but that their calculations were accepted as a reasonable procedure.
But must they not at least be trained to do the same calculations? Doesn't this belong
essentially to the concept of calculating? I believe that we could imagine deviations
here too.

44. Can we say that mathematics teaches an experimental method of investigation,
teaches us to formulate empirical questions (cf. p. 381).†1



Page Break 411
Can't it be said to teach me e.g. to ask whether a particular body moves according to the
equation of a parabola?--What does mathematics do in this case? Without it, or without
the mathematicians, we should of course not have arrived at the definition of this curve.
But was defining this curve itself a piece of mathematics? Would it for instance imply
mathematics for people to investigate the movement of a body so as to see whether its
path can be represented by the construction of an ellipse with two pegs and a string?
Was whoever invented this inquiry doing mathematics?
He did create a new concept. But was it in the same way as mathematics does? Was it
like the way the multiplication 18  15 = 270 gives us a new concept?
Page 411
45. Then can't one say that mathematics teaches us to count? But if it teaches us to
count, then why doesn't it also teach us to compare colours?
Page 411
It is clear that if someone teaches us the equation of an ellipse he is teaching us a new
concept. But if someone proves to us that this ellipse and this straight line intersect at
these points--he too is giving us a new concept.
Page 411
Teaching us the equation of an ellipse is like teaching us to count. But it is also like
teaching us to ask the question: "Are there a hundred times as many marbles here as
there?".
Page 411


                                            273
Now if I had taught someone this question in a language-game, and a method of
answering it, should I have taught him mathematics? Or


Page Break 412
would it have been that only if he operated with signs?
Page 412
(Would that be like asking: "Would it be geometry, even if it only consisted of the
Euclidian axioms?")
Page 412
If arithmetic teaches us the question "how many?", then why doesn't it also teach the
question "how dark?"?
Page 412
Is a new conceptual connexion a new concept? And does mathematics create
conceptual connexions?
Page 412
But the question "are there a hundred times as many marbles here as there?" is surely
not a mathematical question. And the answer to it is not a mathematical proposition. A
mathematical question would be: "are 170 marbles a hundred times as many as 3
marbles?" (And this is a question of pure, not of applied mathematics.)
Page 412
Now ought I to say that whoever teaches us to count etc. gives us new concepts; and
also whoever uses such concepts to teach us pure mathematics?
Page 412
The word "concept" is too vague by far.


Page Break 413
Page 413
Mathematics teaches us to operate with concepts in a new way. And hence it can be
said to change the way we work with concepts.
Page 413
But only a mathematical proposition that has been proved or that is assumed as a
postulate does this, not a problematic proposition.
Page 413
46. But can we not experiment mathematically? for instance, try whether a square bit of
paper can be folded into a cat's head, where the physical properties of the paper, such as
stiffness or elasticity, don't come into the question? Now certainly we speak of trying
here. And why not of experimenting too? This case is like one in which we substitute

                                           274
pairs of numbers in the equation x2 + y2 = 25 in order to find by trial and error one that
satisfies the equation. And if one finally arrives at 32 + 42 = 25, is this proposition now
the result of an experiment? For why did we call our procedure "trying"? Should we
also have called it that if someone always solved such problems first time off with
complete certainty (giving the signs of certainty) but without calculating? What did the
experiment consist in here? Suppose that before he gives the solution, he has a vision of
it.--

Page 414
But, that everything can (also) be interpreted as following, doesn't mean that everything
is following.
Page 414
But how then does the teacher interpret the rule for the pupil? (For he is certainly
supposed to give it a particular interpretation.)--Well, how but by means of words and
training?
And if the pupil reacts to it thus and thus; he possesses the rule inwardly.
But this is important, namely that this reaction, which is our guarantee of
understanding, presupposes as a surrounding particular circumstances, particular forms
of life and speech. (As there is no such thing as a facial expression without a face.)
(This is an important movement of thought.)
Page 414
48. Does a line compel me to trace it?--No; but if I have decided to use it as a model in
this way, then it compels me.--No; then I compel myself to use it in this way. I as it
were cleave to it.--But here it is surely important that I can form the decision with the
(general) interpretation so to speak once for all, and can hold by it, and do not interpret
afresh at every step.
Page 414
The line, it might be said, intimates to me how I am to go. But that is of course only a
picture. And if I judge that it intimates this or that to me as it were irresponsibly, then I
would not say that I was following it as a rule.

"The line intimates to me how I am to go": that is merely a paraphrase for:--it is my last

Page 415
49. Imagine someone was following a line as a rule in this way: he holds a pair of
compasses, one point of which he carries along the rule, while the other point draws the
line that follows the rule. And as he goes along the rule-line in this fashion, he opens
and doses the compasses, to all appearances with great exactness; as he does this, he
keeps on looking at the rule, as if it determined what he was doing. Now we, who are
watching him, can see no regularity of any kind in this opening and shutting. Hence we
cannot learn his way of following the rule from him either. But we believe him when he
tells us that the line intimated to him to do what he did.
Page 415
Here we should perhaps really say: "The model seems to intimate to him how he has to
go. But it isn't a rule."
Page 415
50. Suppose someone follows the series "1, 3, 5, 7, ... in writing the series 2x + 1; and
he asked himself "But am I always doing the same thing, or something different every
time?"
If from one day to the next someone promises: "Tomorrow I will give up smoking,"
does he say the same thing every day, or every day something different?
Page 415
How is it to be decided whether he always does the same, when the line intimates to
him how he is to go?


Page Break 416
Page 416
51. Didn't I want to say: Only the total picture of the use of the word "same" as it is
interwoven with the uses of the other words, can determine whether he does use the
word as we do?
Page 416
Doesn't he always do the same, namely, let the line intimate to him how he is to go?
But suppose he says that the line intimates now this to him and now that? Couldn't he
now say: in one sense he is always doing the same thing, but still he isn't following a
rule? And cannot the one who is following a rule nevertheless also say that in a certain
sense he does something different every time? Thus whether he does the same thing or
keeps on doing something different does not determine whether he is following a rule.
Page 416
The procedure of following a rule can be described only like this: by describing in a
different way what we do in the course of it.

                                            276
Would it make sense to say: "If he did something different every time, we should not
say he was following a rule"? That does not make sense.
Page 416
52. Following a rule is a particular language-game. How can it be described? When do
we say he has understood the description?--We do this and that; if he now reacts in
such-and-such a way, he understood the game. And this "this and that," "in
such-and-such a way" doesn't contain an "and so on."--Or: if I used an "and so on" in
the description, and were to be asked what that meant, I should have to explain that in
turn by the narration of examples; or perhaps by means of a gesture. And I should then
regard it as a sign of understanding, if


Page Break 417
he, say, repeated the gesture with an intelligent expression; and in special cases acted in
such-and-such a way.
Page 417
"But then doesn't the understanding reach beyond all the examples?" A very remarkable
expression, and one that is entirely natural.
Page 417
When one recounts examples and then says "and so on", this latter expression does not
get explained in the same way as the examples.
Page 417
For the "and so on" might on the one hand be replaced by an arrow, which indicates
that the end of the series of examples is not supposed to signify an end of their
application. On the other hand "and so on" also means: that's enough, you've
understood; we don't need any more examples.
Page 417
If we replace the expression by a gesture, it might easily be that people only took our
series of examples as they were supposed to (only followed it correctly) when we made
this gesture at the end. Thus it would be quite analogous to pointing to an object or a
place.
Page 417
53. Let us imagine a line intimating to me how I am to follow it; that is, as my eye
travels along the line a voice within me says: "This way!"--What is the difference
between this process of obeying a kind of inspiration and that of obeying a rule? For
they are surely not


Page Break 418
the same. In the case of inspiration I await direction. I shall not be able to teach anyone
else my 'technique' of following the line. Unless, indeed, I teach him some way of
hearkening, some kind of receptivity. But then, of course, I cannot require him to
follow the line in the same way as I do.


                                            277
Page 418
It would also be possible to imagine such instruction in a sort of calculating. The
children can calculate, each in his own way--as long as they listen to their inner voice
and obey it. Calculating in this way would be something like composing.
Page 418
For doesn't the technique (the possibility) of training someone else in following it
belong to the following of a rule? To be sure, by means of examples. And the criterion
of his understanding must be the agreement of their individual actions. Hence it is not
as it is with instruction in receptivity.
Page 418
54. How do you follow the rule?--"I do it like this;..." and now there follow general
explanations and examples.--How do you follow the voice of the line?--"I look at it,
exclude all thoughts, etc., etc."

"I wouldn't say that it kept on intimating something else to me--if I were following it as
a rule". Can one say that? "Doing the same" is tied up with "following the rule."

if I do do so?
Page 419
But can I play the language-game, if I don't react in this way?
Page 419
56. One does not feel that one must always be awaiting the tip-off of the rule. On the
contrary. We are not excited about what it will tell us to do next, rather it always tells us
the same thing, and we do what it says.
Page 419
It might be said: we look at what we do in following according to the rule from the
point of view: always the same.
Page 419
You might say to someone you were beginning to train: "See, I always do the same:..."
Page 419
57. When do we say: "the line intimates this to me as a rule--always the same." And on
the other hand: "It keeps on intimating to me what I have to do--it is not a rule."
In the first case the story is: I have no further court of appeal for what I have to do. The

                                            278

Isn't there a still deeper explanation; or must not the understanding of the explanation
be deeper?--Well, have I myself a deeper understanding? Have I more than I give in the
explanation?
But whence arises the feeling, as if I had more than I can say?
Page 420
Is it that I interpret the not-limited as length which reaches further than any given

"But I know what 'same' means!"--I have no doubt of that; I know it too.

60. "The line intimates to me..." Here the emphasis is on the impalpability of the
intimating. On this: that nothing stands between the rule and my action.
Page 421
One could however imagine that someone multiplied, multiplied correctly, with such
feelings; kept on saying: "I don't know--now suddenly the rules intimates this to me!"
and that we reply: "Of course; for you are going ahead perfectly in accordance with the
rule."
Page 421
Following a rule: this can be contrasted with various things. Among other things the

But might we not also calculate as we do calculate (all agreeing), etc., and yet at every
step have the feeling of being guided by the rule as if by a spell; astonished maybe at
agreeing with one another? (Thanking the deity perhaps for this agreement.)

From this you can just see how much there is to the physiognomy of what we call
"following a rule" in everyday life!

One follows the rule mechanically. Hence one compares it with a mechanism.

part in our life.--As when

                               and
yield the figure




But if this were an important operation, our ordinary concept of arithmetical addition
would perhaps be different.
Page 423
It is natural for us to regard it as a geometrical fact, not as a fact of physics, that a
square piece of paper can be folded into a boat or hat. But is not geometry, so
understood, part of physics? No; we split geometry off from physics. The geometrical
possibility from the physical one. But what if we left them together? If we simply said:
"If you do this and this and this with the piece of paper then this will be the result"?
What has to be done might be told in a rhyme. For might it not be that someone did not
distinguish at all between the two possibilities? As e.g. a child who learns this
technique does not. It does not know and does not consider whether these results of
folding are possible only because the paper stretches, is pulled out of shape, when it is
folded in such-and-such a way, or because it is not pulled out of shape.
Page 423
And now isn't it like this in arithmetic too? Why shouldn't it be possible for people to
learn to calculate without having the concepts of a mathematical and a physical fact?
They merely know that this


Page Break 424
is always the result when they take care and do what they have learnt.
Let us imagine that while we were calculating the figures on paper altered erratically. A
1 would suddenly become a 6 and then a 5 and then again a 1 and so on. And I want to
assume that this does not make any difference to the calculation because, as soon as I
read a figure in order to calculate with it or to apply it, it once more becomes the one
that we have in our calculating. At the same time, one would see how the figures
change during the calculation; but we are trained not to worry about this.


                                           281
Of course, even if we do not make the above assumption, this calculation could lead to
useful results.
Here we calculate strictly according to rules, yet this result does not have to come
out.--I am assuming that we see no sort of regularity in the alteration of the figures.
Page 424
I want to say: this calculating could really be conceived as an experiment, and we
might for example say: "Let's try what will come out now if I apply this rule".
Page 424
Or again: "Let us make the following experiment: we'll write the figures with ink of
such-and-such a composition... and calculate according to the rule...."
Page 424
Now you might of course say: "In this case the manipulation of figures according to
rules is not calculation."
Page 424
"We are calculating only when there is a must behind the result."--But suppose we don't
know this must,--is it contained in the calculation


Page Break 425
all the same? Or are we not calculating, if we do it quite naïvely?
Page 425
How about the following: You aren't calculating if, when you get now this, now that
result, and cannot find a mistake, you accept this and say: this simply shews that certain
circumstances which are still unknown have an influence on the result.
Page 425
This might be expressed: if calculation reveals a causal connexion to you, then you are
not calculating.
Page 425
Our children are not only given practice in calculation but are also trained to adopt a
particular attitude towards a mistake in calculating.†1
Page 425
What I am saying comes to this, that mathematics is normative. But "norm" does not
mean the same thing as "ideal".
Page 425
62. The introduction of a new rule of inference can be conceived as a transition to a
new language-game. I can imagine one in which for example one person pronounces: 'p
 q', another 'p' and a third draws the conclusion.


                                            282
Page 425
63. Is it possible to observe that a surface is coloured red and blue;



Page Break 426
and not to observe that it is red? Imagine that a kind of colour adjective were used for
things that are half red and half blue: they are said to be 'bu'. Now might not someone
be trained to observe whether something is bu; and not to observe whether it is also
red? Such a man would then only know how to report: "bu", or "not bu". And from the
first report we could draw the conclusion that the thing was partly red.
Page 426
I am imagining that the observation happens by means of a psychological sieve, which
for example only lets through the fact that the surface is blue-white-red (the French
tricolour) or that it is not.
Page 426
Now if it is a special observation that the surface is partly red, how can this follow
logically from the preceding? Surely logic cannot tell us what to observe.
Page 426
Someone is counting apples in a box; he counts up to 100. Someone else says: "so there
are at any rate 50 apples in the box" (that is all that interests him). This is surely a
logical conclusion; but isn't it also a special piece of experience?
Page 426
64. A surface which is divided into a number of strips is observed by several people.
The colours of the strips change every minute, all at the same time.




Page Break 427
Now the colours are: red, green, blue, white, black, blue.
It is observed:


           red. blue  black. . white.

Page 427
It is also observed:


           ~green  ~white


                                            283
and someone draws the conclusion:


           ~ green : red. blue. ~black.

And these implications are 'material implications' in Russell's sense.
Page 427
But then is it possible to observe that


           red. blue  black. . white?

Isn't one observing arrangements of colours, and so for example that
red.blue.black.white; and then deducing that proposition?
But may not someone who is observing a surface be quite preoccupied with the
question whether it is going to turn green or not green; and if he now sees: ~green, need
he be attentive to the particular colour that the surface is?
And might not someone be preoccupied with the aspect red.blue  black.. white? If,
for example, he has been taught to forget everything else, and only to look at the
surface from this point of view. (In particular circumstances it might be all one to
people whether objects were red or green but important whether they had one of these
colours or some third one. And in this case there might be a colour word for "red or
green".)
Page 427
But if one can observe that


           red. blue: black. . white

and


           ~green  ~white



Page Break 428
then one can also observe, and not merely infer, that


           ~green : red. blue. ~black.

Page 428
If these are three observations then it must also be possible for the third observation not
to agree with the logical conclusion from the first two.


                                            284
Page 428
Then is it imaginable that someone observing a surface should see the combination
red-black (say as a flag), but if he now sets himself to see one of the two halves, he sees
blue instead of red? Well, you have just described it.--It would perhaps be as if
someone were to look at a group of apples and always see it as two groups of two
apples each, but as soon as he tried to take the whole lot in at a glance, they seemed to
him to be five. This would be a very remarkable phenomenon. And it is not one of
whose possibility we take any notice.
Page 428
Remember that a rhombus, seen as a diamond, does not look like a parallelogram. Not
that the opposite sides seem not to be parallel, only the parallelism does not strike us.
Page 428
65. I could imagine someone saying that he saw a red and yellow star but did not see
anything yellow--because he sees the star as, so to speak, a conjunction of coloured
parts, which he cannot separate.
Page 428
For example he had figures like these before him:


Page Break 429




Asked whether he sees a red pentagon he would say "yes"; asked whether he sees a
yellow one, "no". In the same way he says that he sees a blue triangle but not a red
one.--When his attention was drawn to it perhaps he said: "Yes, now I see it; I had not
taken the star like that."

                                           285
Page 429
And it might seem to him that you can't separate the colours in the star, because you
can't separate the shapes.
Page 429
You cannot learn to view the geography of a landscape as a whole, if you move on in it
so slowly that you have already forgotten one bit when you come to another.
Page 429
66. Why do I always speak of being compelled by a rule; why not of the fact that I can
choose to follow it? For that is equally important.
But I don't want to say, either, that the rule compels me to act like this; but that it makes
it possible for me to hold by it and let it compel me.
Page 429
And if e.g. you play a game, you keep to its rules. And it is an interesting fact that
people set up rules for the fun of it, and then keep to them.


Page Break 430
Page 430
My question really was: "How can one keep to a rule†1?" And the picture that might
occur to someone here is that of a short bit of handrail, by means of which I am to let
myself be guided further than the rail reaches. [But there is nothing there; but there isn't
nothing there!] For when I ask "How can one...", that means that something here looks
paradoxical to me; and so a picture is confusing me.
Page 430
"I never thought of its being red too; I only saw it as part of a multi-coloured
ornament."
Page 430
Logical inference is a transition that is justified if it follows a particular paradigm and
its rightness is not dependent on anything else.
Page 430
67. We say: "If you really follow the rule in multiplying, you must all get the same
result." Now if this is only the somewhat hysterical way of putting things that you get
in university talk, it need not interest us overmuch.
It is however the expression of an attitude towards the technique of calculation, which
comes out everywhere in our life. The emphasis of the must corresponds only to the
inexorableness of this attitude both to the technique of calculating and to a host of
related techniques.
Page 430
The mathematical Must is only another expression of the fact that mathematics forms
concepts.

                                             286
Page Break 431
Page 431
And concepts help us to comprehend things. They correspond to a particular way of
dealing with situations.
Page 431
Mathematics forms a network of norms.
Page 431
68. It is possible to see the complex formed of A and B, without seeing A or B. It is
even possible to call the complex a "complex of A and B" and to think that this name
points to some kind of kinship of this whole with A and with B. Thus it is possible to
say that one is seeing a complex formed from A and B but neither A nor B. As for
example one might say that there is a reddish yellow here but neither red nor yellow.
Page 431
Now can I have A and B before me and also see them both, but only observe A  B?
Well, in a certain sense this is surely possible. I was thinking of it like this: the observer
is preoccupied with a particular aspect; for example, he has a special kind of paradigm
before him; he is engaged in a particular routine of application.--And just as he can be
adjusted to A  B, so he can also be adjusted to A.B. Thus only A.B strikes him, and
not, for example, A. To be adjusted to A  B might be said to mean: to react to
such-and-such a situation with the concept 'A  B'. And one can of course do exactly
the same thing with A.B too.
Page 431
Say someone is interested only in A.B, and so whatever happens he judges merely
either "A.B", or "~(A.B)"; then I can imagine his judging "A.B" and saying "No, I see
A.B" when he is asked "Do you see B?" As for example some people who see A.B will
not concede that they see A  B.


Page Break 432
Page 432
69. But 'seeing' the surface 'blue all over' and 'seeing' it 'red all over' are surely 'genuine'
experiences, and yet we say that a man could not have them at the same time.
Page 432
Now suppose he assured us that he saw this surface really red all over and blue all over
at the same time? We should have to say: "You aren't making yourself intelligible to
us."
Page 432
With us the proposition "1 foot = ... cm." is timeless. But we could imagine the case in

                                              287
which the foot and the metre gradually altered somewhat, and kept on having to be
compared anew in order for us to calculate their translations into one another.
Page 432
But have we not determined the relative length of foot and metre experimentally? Yes;
but the result was given the character of a rule.
Page 432
70. In what sense can a proposition of arithmetic be said to give us a concept? Well let
us interpret it, not as a proposition, as something that decides a question, but as
a--somehow accepted--connexion of concepts.
Page 432

The equating of 252 and 625 could be said to give me a new concept. And the proof
shews what the position is regarding this equality.--"To give a new concept" can only
mean to introduce a new employment of a concept, a new practice.


Page Break 433
Page 433
"How can the proposition be separated from its proof?" This question betrays a false
conception.
Page 433
The proof is part of the surroundings of the proposition.
Page 433
'Concept' is a vague concept.
Page 433
71. It is not in every language-game that there occurs something that one would call a
concept.
Page 433
Concept is something like a picture with which one compares objects.
Page 433
Are there concepts in language-game (2)†1? Still, it would be easy to add to it in such a
way that "slab", "block" etc. became concepts. For example, by means of a technique of
describing or portraying those objects. There is of course no sharp dividing line
between language-games which work with concepts and others. What is important is
that the word "concept" refers to one kind of expedient in the mechanism of language-
games.




                                           288
Page Break 434
Page 434
72. Consider a mechanism. For example this one:




While the point A describes a circle, B describes a figure eight. Now we write this
down as a proposition of kinematics.
When I work the mechanism its movement proves the proposition to me; as would a
construction on paper. The proposition corresponds e.g. to a picture of the mechanism
with the paths of the points A and B drawn in. Thus it is in a certain respect a picture of
that movement. It holds fast what the proof shews me. Or--what it persuades me of.
Page 434
If the proof registers the procedure according to the rule, then by doing this it produces
a new concept.
Page 434
In producing a new concept it convinces me of something. For it is essential to this
conviction that the procedure according to these rules must always produce the same
configuration. ('Same', that is, by our ordinary rules of comparison and copying.)
Page 434
With this is connected the fact that we can say that proof must shew the existence of an
internal relation. For the internal relation is the operation producing one structure from
another, seen as equivalent to the picture of the transition itself--so that now the
transition


Page Break 435
according to this series of configurations is eo ipso a transition according to those rules
for operating.
Page 435
In producing a concept, the proof convinces me of something: what it convinces me of
is expressed in the proposition that it has proved.

                                            289
Page 435
Problem: Does the adjective "mathematical" always mean the same: when we speak of
"mathematical" concepts, of "mathematical" propositions and of mathematical proofs?
Page 435
Now what has the proved proposition got to do with the concept created by the proof?
Again: what has the proved proposition got to do with the internal relations
demonstrated by the proof?
Page 435
The picture (proof-picture) is an instrument producing conviction.
Page 435
It is clear that one can also apply an unproved mathematical proposition; even a false
one.
Page 435
The mathematical proposition says to me: Proceed like this!
Page 435
73. "If the proof convinces us, then we must also be convinced of the axioms." Not as
by empirical propositions, that is not their role. In the language-game of verification by
experience they are excluded. Are, not empirical propositions, but principles of
judgement.


Page Break 436
Page 436
A language-game: How have I to imagine one in which axioms, proofs and proved
propositions occur?
Someone who hears a bit of logic for the first time at school is straightway convinced
when he is told that a proposition implies itself, or when he hears the law of
contradiction, or of excluded middle.--Why is he immediately convinced? Well, these
laws fit entirely into the use of language that he is so familiar with. Then he learns
perhaps to prove more complicated propositions of logic. The proofs are exhibited to
him, and he is again convinced; or he invents proofs himself.
In this way he learns new techniques of inference. And also, what account to lay it to, if
now errors appear.
Page 436
The proof convinces him that he must hold fast to the proposition, to the technique that
it prescribed; but it also shews him how he can hold fast to the proposition without
running any risk of getting into conflict with experience.
Page 436
74. Any proof in applied mathematics may be conceived as a proof in pure mathematics
which proves that this proposition follows from these propositions, or can be got from

                                           290
them by means of such and such operations; etc.
Page 436
The proof is a particular path. When we describe it, we do not mention causes.
Page 436
I act on the proof.--But how?--I act according to the proposition that got proved.


Page Break 437
Page 437
The proof taught me e.g., a technique of approximation. But still it proved something,
convinced me of something. That is expressed by the proposition: It says what I shall
now do on the strength of the proof.
Page 437
The proof belongs to the background of the proposition. To the system in which the
proposition has an effect.
Page 437
See, this is how 3 and 2 yield 5. Note this proceeding.
Page 437
Every empirical proposition may serve as a rule if it is fixed, like a machine part, made
immovable, so that now the whole representation turns around it and it becomes part of
the coordinate system, independent of facts.
Page 437
"This is how it is, if this proposition is derived from these ones. That you have to
admit."--What I admit is, this is what I call such a procedure.
