# Transactional Wittgenstein: A New Interpretation
## Book Proposal

### Overview
This book presents a novel reinterpretation of Wittgenstein's philosophy, redirecting focus from language per se to language as an exemplar of transactions. By viewing Wittgenstein's insights through a transactional lens, we uncover new applications of his thought across multiple disciplines while maintaining the rigor and depth of his original work.

### The Book's Unique Contribution
1. **Novel Interpretation**: Offers the first comprehensive treatment of Wittgenstein's philosophy through a transactional framework
2. **Interdisciplinary Relevance**: Extends Wittgenstein's insights beyond philosophy to economics, sociology, and communication studies
3. **Contemporary Application**: Demonstrates the relevance of Wittgenstein's thought to modern issues in technology, social interaction, and economic exchange

### Market and Audience
**Primary Audience**:
- Academic philosophers specializing in Wittgenstein, philosophy of language, and pragmatics
- Scholars interested in interdisciplinary applications of philosophical thought
- Graduate students in philosophy and related fields

**Secondary Audience**:
- Researchers in economics, sociology, and communication studies
- Advanced undergraduates in philosophy
- Practitioners in fields involving complex social transactions (e.g., business negotiation, diplomatic relations)

2. "Wittgenstein's Philosophy of Language" (Various) - Traditional interpretations focusing solely on linguistic aspects
