  "abstract": "This work explores Wittgenstein's philosophical contributions to understanding language as a transactional process rather than a static medium. Through a detailed analysis of his early and later works, we develop a framework that reconceptualizes communication as a dynamic, co-creative exchange between participants embedded in specific contexts and governed by evolving rules.",
